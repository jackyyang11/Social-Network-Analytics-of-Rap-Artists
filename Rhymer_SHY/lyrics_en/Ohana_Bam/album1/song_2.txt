I ain't been around the world
Ain't nobody else
That can do it like us
With nobody help
When the chips about to fall
And our back against the wall
Know it's only one place I go

All roads lead home
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah)
All roads lead home
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
All roads lead home

Welcome to my city
It's the only place I know
Gorillas rolling with me
And we living by the coat
No hope in forgiving
I don't know what you was told
But we was on the corner flipping struggle in the cold

Put that city on the map
Put that city on my back
Till I'm up with a "milli" on my lap
Go time till the haters take a lap
Cause that's what made me into this
This what make them into that
All that faking this and that
Thinking this is that

I ain't been around the world
Ain't nobody else
That can do it like us
With nobody help
When the chips about to fall
And our back against the wall
Know it's only one place I go

All roads lead home
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
All roads lead home
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

Gotta make a comeback
Can I get a hand while I unpack
How could you forget that I'm from that
[?]
Throw me to the jungle, come back with gold
You take my place, king of the throne
And I don't mean Rome, but I'm coming strong
I'm on the road and I'm coming home

Stuck in the middle of nowhere
Times I wish I could ditch and go there
Grant the wish I'm depended on
What I'm chilling for, I won't let anymore yeah
Honestly I'm not just anybody
I know I go hard as anybody
Say my goodbyes and hellos
Cause all them roads lead home

I ain't been around the world
Ain't nobody else
That can do it like us
With nobody help
When the chips about to fall
And our back against the wall
Know it's only one place I go

All roads lead home
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
All roads lead home
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

So if you with me, let me know
Let's bring it home
They know we always on the go
We bring it home
(We bring it home)

So if you with me, let me know
Let's bring it home
You shoulda knew it from the go
All roads lead home
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Welcome to my city, welcome welcome to my city)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(The only place I know)
All roads lead home
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Welcome to my city, welcome welcome to my city)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(The only place I know)
All roads lead home
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Welcome to my city, welcome welcome to my city)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(The only place I know)

All roads lead home
