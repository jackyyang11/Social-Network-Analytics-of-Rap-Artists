*Sultry Voice*
Daddy [x4]

[Hook]
Girl come here to daddy
You gotta forgive me
You don't understand me
But daddy been busy
And oh you look pretty
Money on plenty
Hundreds and fifties
Daddy been busy

[Chorus]
Daddy been busy [x8]

[Verse 1]
She like "is you with me?
Well let me guess, you busy"
Actually, I was just on the way home
I wondered if you hear me
You know your ass love to play games
All day I think you crazy
She say "if so, you made me"
Girl you know you my baby
In the bedroom sitting in your bathe towel
In the streets you be actin' like we ain't wild
Might roll up one, put her place down
So bad, I might have to put my plate down
I sink right in like quick sand
You strapped onto me like wrist band
Gotta go handle the business that I'm mixed in
If you missin' me then come get in the mix then
Come here

[Hook]
Girl come here to daddy
You gotta forgive me
You don't understand me
But daddy been busy
And oh you look pretty
Money on plenty
Hundreds and fifties
Daddy been busy

[Chorus]
Daddy been busy [x8]

[Verse 2]
As we laid down
I was thinkin' bout money, I spaced out
She say she gon' give me my space now
She packed her bags, she raced out
She know she bad, got great style
She been gone for a couple long days now
I don't know why she acting like I ain't wild
'Cause even when she runnin' I'ma chase down, you
You know you a queen, you my main thing
So can't nobody tell you that you can't hang
Wake up in the morning, uhh, bang bang
Now she whippin' up the bacon and the pancakes
I know that you hate it when the bed break
But I know that you love it when the legs shake
Treatin' every day like it's Wednesday
So it don't really matter what your friends say
Come here

[Hook]
Girl come here to daddy
You gotta forgive me
You don't understand me
But daddy been busy
And oh you look pretty
Money on plenty
Hundreds and fifties
Daddy been busy

[Chorus]
Daddy been busy [x7]
