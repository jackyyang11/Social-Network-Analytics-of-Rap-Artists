[Hook]
(I don't miss you)
Don't miss you the same
I moved onto new things
You just threw it away, so no I don't
(I don't miss you)
No time for your face
Done texting your name
Nothing left to say
No, no, no, no
(I don't miss you)

[Verse 1]
At first I kinda missed you girl, now it's whatever
Man I swear this marijuan' make it all better
Used to run a marathon now I don't sweat her
Wanna see her smile, wanna be her glow baby
Haters see her down, wanna see her grow baby
Hope to see you 'round, when I'm in her go crazy
Roll the windows down if I'm in the Mercedes
Grown and none of these hoes ain't first lady
On and my only goal is start savin'
Don't know where my money goes it just keep fadin'
It's me and Ohana bros surely we faded
It's me and Ohana bros surely we Asian
She want a relationship, shorty be patient
Say fuck it and take a trip, that's a sweet spaceship
Say fuck it and make her strip, look at me waitin'
We truck it and make a trip, need a vacation

[Hook]
(I don't miss you)
Don't miss you the same
I moved onto new things
You just threw it away, so no I don't
(I don't miss you)
No time for your face
Done texting your name
Nothing left to say
No, no, no, no
(I don't miss you)

[Verse 2]
'member how I used to slide in the ride
Every time with you, now I spend the night inside
'member ma, we would talk
Close the door, hit the lights
'member when it was just you and I
Hit the phone, what you on?
Pick you up, get you home
Baby doll tell me what you sippin' on
That was then, this is now
I don't even hit it now
You hit the door
So talk about love or lie
But you laid it on the line
You ain't on my mind
Put too many years in it to just go ending it
We wasted our time
Had to move on, couldn't take it no more baby
I see you taking your time
Taking your time, taking your time, taking your time
But...

[Hook]
(I don't miss you)
Don't miss you the same
I moved onto new things
You just threw it away, so no I don't
(I don't miss you)
No time for your face
Done texting your name
Nothing left to say
No, no, no, no
(I don't miss you)

[Outro]
(I don't miss you)
(I don't miss you)
(I don't miss you)
