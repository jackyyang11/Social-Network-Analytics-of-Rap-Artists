[Verse 1]
It's no big deal, we're all lucky to be alive
I, myself don't believe in luck, or taking chances, I will survive
Every move I make, every twist and every turn
You scandalize and humble me, I may be slow but I will learn

[Chorus]
Because I'm not going down anymore
No, I'm not going down anymore
No, I'm not going down anymore
No, I'm not going down anymore

[Verse 2]
If I had my way, I would probably just sit and stare
Watch the T.V. or read a book, I'd have no reason to be aware
But I haven't got time, I just could not live that way
I've got to step outside myself, I've still got something left to say

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
Channelled in my groove, part of another space and time
Please allow me to introduce another very good friend of mine
Some call him fear, some call him righteousness
I, myself am not clear, and you can't force me to make a guess
