[Chorus]
If I send for my baby, man, and she doesn't come
Send for my baby, man, and she doesn't come
All the doctors in Hot Springs sure can't help her, none

[Verse 1]
If she gets unruly, thinks she doesn't want to do
She gets unruly, thinks she doesn't want to do
Take my 32-20, boy, cut her half in two
She got a .38 special but I believe it's most too light
.38 special but I believe it's most too light
I got a 32-20 to make the camps all right

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Going to shoot my pistol, going to shoot my gatling gun
Going to shoot my pistol, going to shoot my gatling gun
You made me love you, now your man has come

Oh, baby, where did you stay last night?
Oh, baby, where did you stay last night?
You got your hair all tangled and you aren't talking right
Got a .38 special, boy, it does very well
Got a .38 special and it does very well
Got a 32-20 now, it's a burning hell

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Oh, baby, where did you stay last night?
Oh, baby, where did you stay last night?
You didn't come home till the sun was shining bright
Oh, boy, I just can't take my rest
Oh, boy, I just can't take my rest
With this 32-20 laying up and down my breast
