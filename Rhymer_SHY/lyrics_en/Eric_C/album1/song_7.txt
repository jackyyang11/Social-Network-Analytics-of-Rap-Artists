[Verse 1]
There is a certain girl I have been in love with a long, long time
(What is her name?) I cannot tell you. (No!)
I cannot reveal her name until I have got her
(What is her name?) I cannot tell you. (No!)

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I have tried to get her time and time again
We just end up as nothing but friends
And there is a certain girl I have been in love with a long, long time
(What is her name?) I cannot tell you (No!)

[Chorus]
Well, there is a certain chick I have been sweet on since I met her
(What is her name?) I cannot tell you. (No!)
I cannot repeat her name until I get her
(What is her name?) I cannot tell you. (No!)

[Verse 2]
Well one day, I am going to wake up and say
"I will do anything just to be your slave
And there is a certain girl I have been in love with a long, long time
(What is her name?) I cannot tell you. (No!)

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus]

[Outro]
I cannot tell you. (No!)
I cannot tell you. (No!)
I cannot tell you
