[Intro]
(Haaaaaa), It's Lil Snupe nigga
That feeling was like no other
It started off

[Verse 1: Lil Snupe]
I grew up without a father
I barely had a mother
No brothers, it's just me tryna make it out the struggle
My mind gone just know that my Daddy live in a prison
But i gotta learn from his first
So i ain't in that position
So i'mma grind, and show my people is real
Tired of the project so i'm rappin' hopin' i get a deal
My granny prayin' every night hopin' that i don't get kill
Cause she know i'm thuggin' hard
But i'm focused on the meal, the cheese
That's what i'm really out here chasing though
Tryna do some with my life but people tryna take it though
Money on my mind, i'm headed to the top
School life ain't lookin' good for me, so i'm headed to the block
My mama want me to change, prayin' that i don't be another victim of the game
Tryna not to end up like my daddy locked in chains
Hard times in the hood, made me wanna do better
But still drove me insane
Everythang happen for a reason
But it's only lesson, so i just
Pray to God, thank him that i got a blessin'
Tryna make my mama happy, cause it's outta stressin'
So i'm handlin' business tryna show a lit' progressin'
This way more than rappin', this the way i live
The lonely nights when my mama kicked me out the crib
I was prayin' to God that ion't through go this longer
But i promised it made me harder and made me grind stronger
My hunger, my dedication
I grew up in the hood
Where there ain't no motivation
I know people are hatin'
Hopin' ion't make it
But they gon have to face it
I'm just chillin' smokin' blunts to the face
Being patient

[Chorus]
I'm from uh
Small city, big dreams
Grind hard and i ain't nothin'
But Eighteen, said i'm just Eighteen
And what's crazy my mama had me at sixteen
But now i'm comin' through when that whip clean
She had me at sixteen
She had me at sixteen

[Verse 2: Lil Snupe]
I grew up lookin' for Charlie Brown but he was gone
He left me out here in this cold world all alone
And i ain't have no father figure so i was young acting grown
And my mama washed her hands off me
And left me on my own
It ain't a lot expectin' when you comin' from the project
Want the money like Rucka dax so i started gettin' it poppin'
Donavan on our waist tryna curse the hood, rockin'
Put the police in your life and the cells steady lockin'
I grew up watchin' Dub Jones steady gettin' cash
So ain't want a job i just want to sell crack
Mary Jane with my mama with mama with my dad
So i put 'em too together and it was no turnin' back
J.O.N.E.S.B.O.R.O, a bad place with most people don't wanna go
Have my hommies in jail all they out on parole
With most mommas smokin' crack
The life that i live is thowed
I knew life was real when my dawg Cool died
That been a lil' minute but sometimes i still cry
I never questioned God but sometimes i wonder why?
The people that i really loved always seem to die

[Chorus]
