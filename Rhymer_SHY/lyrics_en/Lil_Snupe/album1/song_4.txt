[Intro:]
Lil Snupe
Hah! Hah!
I'm just a young nigga ballin in the mix, you know
Believe that
Shout out Houston, look

[Verse 1:]
Syrup got me feelin great, what a wonderful taste
Ridin hard through the AZ, jamming that first 48
And it's at this video shoot that fuck with my nigga Trae
And that nigga Future Freebands, shout out to the A
I'm finna hit the highway, everything's my way
I'm ballin every day all day
We party, sippin syrup, swingin with the Kirko, steady Bangin
Diamonds pressing up against the wood grind wheel
Seein that nigga Bun B, I'm like this shit for real?
Motherfuckers don't even understand how I feel
Man I knew I face time, I come outchea buy a grill
I be at fetish and dreams, me and JR be bootin
Man I run Louisiana like J Prince run Houston
Rest in peace AJ Dub, K and all the niggas gone
As you see inspired me, so now I'm putting it on

[Hook:]
'Cus I'm ballin, ballin in the mix
Everything I done broke best believe I'm gon fix
I keep ballin, ballin in the mix
Only worried bout a dollar, can give a fuck bout a bitch
I keep ballin, ballin in the mix
Everything I done broke best believe I'm gon fix
I keep ballin, ballin in the mix
Only worried bout a dollar, can give a fuck bout a bitch

[Verse 2:]
Chyeah, stuntin quicks trunk waver
Schooled up clique tipper
Feelin like Cinderella walkin on glass ass slippers
Off in the bank getting dollars for one of these badass strippers
When I' done it's UPS back to the crib where I ship er
Louie V, no zipper, ball faded with clippers
Off in this old school swingin like it's never gave in by sippers
Slippers get caught with this chopper, pack it twice, Cindy Lauper
Keep on the streets, I'm on top of yo bitch, oh dick I can't stop er
Bitch I ball til I'm fallin, killed em all when I'm crawlin
Tell them haters get at me, woofers sound like I'm browlin
Me and Lil Snupe shinin, conversation was bloody
Bumpy kid I'm reclining, benihana we dinin
You ain't shit if you ain't screwed up like Fat Pat, Big Mo
Pimp C, AJ, Dub K, Mafio
Screw zoo, Clip D, yea we from the south
And they know it when they hear all the motherfuckin mouth

[Hook:]
'Cus I'm ballin, ballin in the mix
Everything I done broke best believe I'm gon fix
I keep ballin, ballin in the mix
Only worried bout a dollar, can give a fuck bout a bitch
I keep ballin, ballin in the mix
Everything I done broke best believe I'm gon fix
I keep ballin, ballin in the mix
Only worried bout a dollar, can give a fuck bout a bitch

[Interlude]

[Hook:]
'Cus I'm ballin, ballin in the mix
Everything I done broke best believe I'm gon fix

Only worried bout a dollar, can give a fuck bout a bitch
I keep ballin, ballin in the mix
Everything I done broke best believe I'm gon fix
I keep ballin, ballin in the mix
Only worried bout a dollar, can give a fuck bout a bitch
