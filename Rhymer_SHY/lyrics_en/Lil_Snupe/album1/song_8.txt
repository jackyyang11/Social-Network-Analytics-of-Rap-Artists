[Intro]
Lil Snupe, Jonesboro, man we in this bitch
Like this my moment for life right here
You know what I’m saying?
Growing up in the projects, no daddy
I barely even had a mama, nigga
I deal with trying to do something with myself
And the police was trying to do something with me
So it’s just real, nigga

[Verse 1]
It’s time for me to keep it real
Where was y’all at when I ain’t even had a place to live
My mama fucked around and kicked me up out the crib
But that ain’t stop shit I was still chasing the mill
And ever since then I’ve been getting my motherfucking bank ro’
Funny how girls want me ‘cause I’m getting pesos
But I ain’t got time to stunt with you fake hoes
Trying to make my money stack tall like Legos
Bad bitches explore me like Diego
Wanna swallow me just like a [?]
‘Cause I’m getting money, so why the fuck do you hate, bro
But I’m on the top, so I think that it’s kinda late, bro
Yeah I’m on, yeah yeah I’m on
Went from sipping on Four Lokos to sipping on Patron
I’m the one that’s right, used to be the one that’s wrong
Now it seem like bad bitches won't’ stop calling my phone
Yeah, ‘cause I’m the fucking nigga
Females with me, we getting ‘em full of liquor
They coming up to my crib, we taking all kinda pictures
Got in that Cali weed we breaking down the [?]
I’m a hot young nigga, I can’t be stopped
In school I ain’t looking good, so I’m headed to the block
Jonesboro where I’m from, you ain’t from then don’t come
Especially without a gun, ‘cause I promise it will get dumb
I’m a Jonesboro nigga, I probably never turn on my hood
Never would, nigga, that shit understood
Fo’s up, nigga know the fo’s up
Reggie kinda cool, but we be smoking that Doja
Beats by Dre, nigga that’s all I be rocking
I keep the blood stuffed like a stocking
They already know about me, they know that they be hating
And I get everybody rocking like I’m Young Nation
I’m headed to the top and niggas gonna have to face it
All I gotta do it keep dropping hits and being patient
See now he the engineer plus he got the videos
And real shit we really finna go see these hoes
318, we on the map, in our map we in the trap
Niggas try to get this money back, I’m all focused on my checks
I grew up without a dad, it’s kinda bad
Real shit reflect my future and my past, but I ain’t tripping though
Gotta get the money ‘cause we clipping though
You run up on me, playa I promise [?]
My niggas right beside me, my niggas they gon’ ride
And if somebody get outta line somebody fucking dying
Homicide, my nigga, we gon’ live
I’m talking about my nigga straight up spitting that real
“You fuck with Lil Snupe wrong somebody gonna end up killed”
I promise yo bitch come up to me I give her head to drill

[Outro: DJ Ya Boy Earl]
Coming for the crown in North Louisiana, man
The little homie Snupe, man
Jonesboro, what’s happening
(Woo! Moment for life freestyle)
