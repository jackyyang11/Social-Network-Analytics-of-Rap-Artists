[Lil Snupe]

Look, Man
It's a crazy life that i'm living
I just pray to God every night that I don't end up in prison
I just Rap what I live, I hope its spiritual healing
To make you say fuck a bitch and get money the sky's the limit

Mama praying to God hoping that I get better
Cause I'm tasting this cheddar, and plus I'm down for whatever
They got my nigga 4 locked up, I'm steady writing them letters
This what I live is cold, need a jacket and sweater

Man I gotta get my own house, gotta get my own whip
My people trying to kick me out, I gotta get my own shit
Nobody out here with me, I'm on that all alone shit
So don't think I'm actin funny when I'm in my zone bitch

Daddy said pray and Dee Low said grind
My aunty said be patient, it's gone happen over time
And this lady I don't know, looked at me say I'm a shine
Just like the fucking sun, I can see that you're the one
