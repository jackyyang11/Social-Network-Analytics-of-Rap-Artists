[Verse 1]
Been raining for three days
On the fast track to the highway
Trying to save a little time
Lord I never should have tried
Taking this back road shortcut
Now I’m way stuck, so sunk
I’ll never catch her now
So I just put the tailgate down
She’s probably somewhere doing 95
I got nothing but this cooler and time

[Chorus]
I cracked one waiting on a ride
Two or three just to pass the time
While she’s headed to a new town
And I’m too lost to be found
She probably thinks that I don’t care
Stuck in the rut in the middle of nowhere
And just my luck I’ll be here all night long
Man, I’m bummed out back road buzzed
And she’s four lane gone
Yeah she’s four lane gone

[Verse 2]
Every empty beer can makes me
Miss her like hell, man I can kick myself
For the place and the shape I’m in holding me back
Yeah my wheels keep on spinning
And she’s ticked off blacktop fast

[Chorus]
I cracked one waiting on a ride
Two or three just to pass the time
While she’s headed to a new town
And I’m too lost to be found
She probably thinks that I don’t care
Stuck in the rut in the middle of nowhere
And just my luck I’ll be here all night long
Man, I’m bummed out back road buzzed
And she’s four lane gone

[Bridge]
While I’m stuck here all alone
With a midnight natty light
One more chance I’ve blown

[Chorus]
I cracked one waiting on a ride
Two or three just to pass the time
While she’s headed to a new town
And I’m too lost to be found
She probably thinks that I don’t care
Stuck in the rut in the middle of nowhere
And just my luck I’ll be here all night long
Man, I’m bummed out back road buzzed
And she’s four lane gone
Yeah, she’s four lane gone

[Outro]
I’m out here all alone
Yeah she’s four lane gone
She’s four lane, four lane gone
Yeah she’s four lane gone
She’s four lane gone
