[Chorus: Kix Brooks]
We’re going all in tonight raise your glass to the ceiling
Neon lights and damn good times that’s what I’m feeling
Take all the keys and lock the door
And we ain’t stopping 'til we hit the floor
We’re going all in, all in tonight

[Verse 1: Colt Ford]
Well, it looks like a country party, everybody grab somebody
Short or tall, fat or thin, ya everybody’s all in
Gonna have a hoe down redneck throwdown
A shot for shot, showdown, right here in the old town
Do you wanna dance a little two step to the field
Get your drink on, ‘cause tonight is the night you’ve been waitin' for
Hit the floor, bartender, one more, I think I’ll never go in

[Chorus: Kix Brooks]
We’re going all in tonight raise your glass to the ceiling
Neon lights and damn good times that’s what I’m feeling
Take all the keys and lock the door
And we ain’t stopping 'til we hit the floor
We’re going all in, all in tonight

[Verse 2: Colt Ford]
Well, it’s too late, oh, well, nobody here's gonna tell
The whole crowd is into it, now you know how we do it
Just another weekend hangin' with my rowdy friends
Jack, Jim, all them, full or half, all in, everybody’s somebody
This is that one party gonna talk about it for the rest of the year
Get a beer, sip some shine, grab my girl but not mine
Everything will be fine if you just sing along

[Chorus: Kix Brooks]
We’re going all in tonight, raise your glass to the ceiling
Neon lights and damn good times that’s what I’m feeling
Take all the keys and lock the door
And we ain’t stopping 'til we hit the floor
We’re going all in, all in tonight

We’re going all in tonight, raise your glass to the ceiling
Neon lights and damn good times that’s what I’m feeling
Take all the keys and lock the door
We ain’t stopping 'til we hit the floor
We’re going all in, all in tonight
We’re going all in, all in tonight
