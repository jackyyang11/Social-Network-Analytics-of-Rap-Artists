[Verse 1: Colt Ford]
Friday night, we were hangin' out down at the river
Everybody just chillin'
It was me and my boys a whole bunch of girls
Lovin' laughin and feelin'
Nothin' but a good time, Jenny looks so fine
I hear at boys it’s all me
Nothin' but the blur, just me and her
Lost in the moment, it makes me wanna

[Chorus: Russell Dickerson & Colt Ford]
I’d trade all of my tomorrows just to keep on feeling like this (keep on feeling like this)
These moments are better than anything I’m ever gonna miss
Ooh, baby
Ain’t never gonna miss that, no
Ain’t never gonna miss that

[Verse 2: Colt Ford]
Saturday, I woke up, tasted strawberry on my lips
Man, I ain’t never danced like that
Lord, the girl moves those hips
Momma’s yellin' and the dad is telling me
That I should really slow down
It’s on the night and I’m still a ride
‘Cause this is my time and my town

[Chorus: Russell Dickerson & Colt Ford]
I’d trade all of my tomorrows just to keep on feeling like this (keep on feeling like this)
These moments are better than anything (anything) I’m ever gonna miss (ever gonna miss aww)
Ooh, baby
Ain’t never gonna miss that

[Bridge: Russell Dickerson & Colt Ford]
Swear you’re young and all you do is race the sun
And every night you chase the moon
You pray it doesn’t end too soon
End too soon
Sing

[Chorus: Russell Dickerson & Colt Ford]
I’d trade all of my tomorrows (all my tomorrows) just to keep on feeling like this (keep on feeling like this)
These moments are better than anything I’m ever gonna miss (woo)
I’d trade all of my tomorrows just to keep on feeling like this (gotta keep on gotta keep on feeling like this)
These moments are better than anything I’m ever gonna miss
I’m never gonna miss that
Never gonna miss that
Ain’t never gonna miss that
Uh uh uh, yep
I’m never gonna miss that
Ain’t never gonna miss that
