[Verse 1: Colt Ford]
I moved to the big city
To make a little bit of money
Then get back home
Now here I am living in a little sub-division
Surrounded by steel and stone
I’ve got a neighbor, he's a lawyer
His wife could be his daughter
He don’t know what to think of me
‘Cause I sight my bow on a styrofoam doe
By the hole of the eighteenth green, uh

[Chorus: Montgomery Gentry]
‘Cause I ain’t out of the woods yet
Still got a blue collar and a red neck
Got a gun rack in the back window of my four wheel drive
A country boy can survive
I say, hey y’all, and I reckon so
Wear the Mossy Oak from head to toe
It's cornfed, cornbread, country as a boy can get
No, I ain’t out, ain’t out of the woods, yet

[Verse 2: Colt Ford & Montgomery Gentry]
Oh, I’m livin' here baby
I’ve got a manicured lawn and a concrete pond
Where my buddies all like to hang I heard that
We fire up the smoker get some pretty girls over
Crank the Hank and let em' shake that thang aww bring em' on
And when the moon goes risin' and the skeeters start to bitin'
All the neighbors is turning in
We be breakin' out the shine and it's hell yeah time
'Til the sun comes up again

[Chorus: Montgomery Gentry]
‘Cause I ain’t out of the woods yet
Still got a blue collar and a red neck
Got a gun rack in the back window of my four wheel drive
A country boy can survive
I say, hey y’all, and I reckon so
Wear the Mossy Oak from head to toe
It's cornfed, cornbread, country as a boy can get
No, I ain’t out, ain’t out of the woods, yet

[Bridge: Colt Ford]
Country of the Conway, sweet tea all day
If you don’t know what I mean (ah yeah)
I be sippin' on some shine
Puttin' clothes on the line
Eatin' cornbread and butter beans

[Chorus: Montgomery Gentry]
‘Cause I ain’t out of the woods yet
Still got a blue collar and a red neck
Got a gun rack in the back window of my four wheel drive
A country boy can survive
I say, hey y’all, and I reckon so
Wear Mossy Oak from my head to toe
As cornfed, cornbread, country as a boy can get
Cause I ain’t out, ain’t out of the woods yet

[Outro: Montgomery Gentry]
Ah it's swampy
Oh, you know this ain't the woods baby
