[Hook: White Dave]
Tryna get the bands, mariachi
Boom cut the sample Ima grill it, hibachi
And I've been on 10 since 10 in the morning
Shining like a star you should've seen a nigga coming
Tryna get the bands, mariachi
Boom cut the sample Ima grill it, hibachi
And I've been on 10 since 10 in the morning
Shootin' like a star I know you niggas started running one

[Verse 1: White Dave]
Headed to the tip, buckle up
All my brothers know what's up, fuck with us we going up
Bank account was mad low but patience still running high
Lame niggas duck and I'm sure you missed the hideout
And I've been on my game now, never runnin' out of bounds
In the lab late night, really tryna get it right
Plus I'm on that promise that I would never stop
Never runnin' out of juice, tell her this is what we sip and mixed it with the goose
Started paying attention, chasing dreams with the Ritalin
Fixated on glory, stiff arm the competition
Never brag on successes that you had in the past
Tables will turn quick, can't make another hit
I refuse to lose, told me team we gon' make it
Went from missing loan payments to laughing at bank statements
A couple of laws got me feeling better
I treat it like it's forever
Gotta get it now I'm


[Hook: White Dave]
Tryna get the bands, mariachi
Boom cut the sample Ima grill it, hibachi
And I've been on 10 since 10 in the morning
Shining like a star you should've seen a nigga coming
Tryna get the bands, mariachi
Boom cut the sample Ima grill it, hibachi
And I've been on 10 since 10 in the morning
Shootin' like a star I know you niggas started running one

[Verse 2: White Dave]
You ain't hear me comin', yo girl told me she cummin'
Blanco known for beats and now  Blanco known for bustin'
Flexin' on any tempo, a legend like Hidden Temple
I'm tempted to actin' nasty, feelings are made of glass
I don't want a Bugatti, all you niggas is buggin'
Zuckerberg ridin' Uber and Buffet pushin' the buckets
Crawled up out of the hole, niggas been through the shit
Traveled across an ocean then survived on a ship, shit
I remember cookin' hella piece up in the kitchen
Now I'm dishin' shit like Jason Kidd and I ain't kiddin'
Call me Skye Summers all I see is red niggas
Shit up in the bomb, 25 yeah it's tickin'
Pourin' down rain never catch a G slippin'
Never since I started rapping now they lookin' at me different
Keep a J Role with the hands down my denim
I see no other option when it comes to winnin'

[Hook: White Dave]
Tryna get the bands, mariachi
Boom cut the sample Ima grill it, hibachi
And I've been on 10 since 10 in the morning
Shining like a star you should've seen a nigga coming
Tryna get the bands, mariachi
Boom cut the sample Ima grill it, hibachi
And I've been on 10 since 10 in the morning
Shootin' like a star I know you niggas started running one
Bang!


[Outro: White Dave]
Tryna get the bands, mariachi
Boom cut the sample Ima grill it, hibachi
And I've been on 10 since 10 in the morning
Shining like a star you should've seen a nigga coming
Tryna get the bands, mariachi
Boom cut the sample Ima grill it, hibachi
And I've been on 10 since 10 in the morning
Shootin' like a star I know you niggas started running one
Bang!
