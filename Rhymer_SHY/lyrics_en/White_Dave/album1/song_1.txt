[Intro: White Dave]
Aye, Aye, Yeah, Shit
Yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: White Dave]
I'm with the money, I guess we go together
After dollars, chasing cheddar
You niggas funny, and I'm amused
Are you ever her [?]

[Chorus: White Dave]
Man I'm on now, man I'm on now
Man I'm on now, in the zone on now
I'm to the skrilla, to the cheese, to the peso
I'm hella deep with my niggas, like a case low
I'm bout the money, I'm bout the money
I'm bout the money, I'm bout the money
I'm bout the money, I'm bout the money
I'm bout the money, I'm bout the money, woah

[Verse 1: White Dave]
All about the green since I heard C.R.E.A.M
Fell in love with gold making music out in Los Feliz
Comma after comma, man I need it like it's oxygen
Never thought I'd make a red cent, writing with the pen
European whips are available, sticking with stain
Cop a 'Rari from the 80's when I make a 'mil
Cop a crib and chill, we can get a plaque, he agree with that
Hit the lab, cook them keys, hit em with the rap
Boom's like the drugs, got it pumping now we making racks
We in 2K and we ain't in the NBA
Niggas really ballin' out and that's a fact
On the real life's a struggle
Had to cut some close ties with a battle axe
Money come and money flow, it got me singing
Still stacking more gold, more weed
More tunes, more rings, priding on big things
Dave P cold stunting at your neighborhood function

[Pre-Chorus: White Dave]
I'm with the money, I guess we go together
After dollars, chasing cheddar
You niggas funny, and I'm amused
Are you ever her [?]

[Chorus: White Dave]
Man I'm on now, man I'm on now
Man I'm on now, in the zone on now
I'm to the skrilla, to the cheese, to the peso
I'm hella deep with my niggas, like a case low
I'm bout the money, I'm bout the money
I'm bout the money, I'm bout the money
I'm bout the money, I'm bout the money
I'm bout the money, I'm bout the money, woah

[Verse 2: Nef The Pharaoh]
Still in the hood I can't forget where I started
Aww shit, y'all are [?] and I'm a target
I'mma shoot a three off that left pivot (Pfttt)
Party ain't a party without Nef in it
I get Popeyes chicken bitch, real spinach
You should see my son, he a spittin' image
Twenty golds in my mouth, I got a rich dentist
Bitch all I make is hits, somebody call a Guinness
I don't rock a cassio, but I got a classy hoe
And she suck hella dick, swallow for the hell of it
She remember where it came from and so she lick the tip
Pringles, I'm bout my chips
Bingo, I'm dogging shit

[Bridge: White Dave]
Get into the check, get into the dough
Told my niggas never ever trip
Niggas hate, I just want the cake
Paint is on my whip, check came
Now I own that bitch
Keep some weed rolled
Oh for sure, you know I'm on that shit
Balling ain't a hobby, ball was necessary
I have seen the bottom [?]
It was very scary
Girls call Dave every day, the fourteenth, of February
God damn, a legendary

[Verse 3: Rexx Life Raj]
Look, Aye
Look I'm really bout that moolah, til' it bubble over
You just talking about it, I'm a young business owner, aye
Been around the world, Thailand sipping coronas
Always been myself, never had to switch my persona, aye
These niggas nerd as fuck
I need my money pronto, tell 'em to hurry up
And count a check for the rec's, aye
You been counterfeit at your best
I should put a money counter on the counter
Shit's a mess
They gone flex, is a nigga like me supposed to be impressed?
Negative, I've been tallying wins consecutive, aye
They all on my dick, let me live
The brokest, we the loudest, I guess it is what it is, aye

[Chorus: White Dave]
Man I'm on now, man I'm on now
Man I'm on now, in the zone on now
I'm to the skrilla, to the cheese, to the peso
I'm hella deep with my niggas, like a case low
I'm bout the money, I'm bout the money
I'm bout the money, I'm bout the money
I'm bout the money, I'm bout the money
I'm bout the money, I'm bout the money, woah
