[Verse 1]
Dash back to the bay, can't wait
Been away tryna get it, Sac. State (yeah)
Came back home, I'm a rapper now (yeah)
Boom serving bass like he trappin' now
Oh my, suit and tie, been fly
Interviews, hard shoes, hate that
Rap shows, bad freaks, need that
More weed, more beats, and more features
Long days, no breaks, it wasn't worth it
Low lab and no pad, it wasn't working
Fuck that, my stew shit was back home
Snapped back, I came back, and that's that
Been real this ain't an act
Dave went from bookworm to lab rat
Lay back I [?] up and stack racks
Game tight, hella bank, you hella ain't
Hesitation, no way like Jose
Don't trust a thing that these hoes say
No sweat, smoke more and stress less
Never changed up
Remember who you learned the game from

[Chorus]
Hella trees when you wanna blow it down, oh
Hella high you can take a look around though
Might rain you might need an umbrella
Hella niggas out here grinding for the cheddar
Hella niggas out here grinding for they family
Hella niggas and they grinding for a Grammy
Hella girls if you out here tryna find one
Hella hoes for you, really find a diamond

[Verse 2]
Made a couple choices that I question in the last few
Life ain't worth living if you staring in the rear view
My circle questioning my motives like a suspect
Once I realized all them niggas really suspect
Time for Dave to get it, any means like I'm Malcolm
On top that's the only real outcome
Saw the homies hit the corner then they started dumping
Closed the chicken spot and started serving fried dumplings
Saw my old chick hanging with my old cousin
Now she hit me cause my record started buzzing
Try with all your might and you might get lucky
I don't wanna backtrack, wait bring the beat back-
Home, change with a difference keep it chill
Learn your worth and pay the bills
Chasing dolla-dolla bills
Shit done changed
I adapt quick
Found my inner peace in the clouds
[?] bomb weed, feel me?

[Chorus]
Hella trees when you wanna blow it down, oh
Hella high you can take a look around though
Might rain you might need an umbrella
Hella niggas out here grinding for the cheddar
Hella niggas out here grinding for they family
Hella niggas and they grinding for a Grammy
Hella girls if you out here tryna find one
Hella hoes for you, really find a diamond

[Post Chorus]
I see a whole new different
See, I might be tripping
Not my city
No, no, not my city
See, I love my brothers
Never kill one another
Why we hating on each other?
We should pray for each other

[Chorus]
Hella trees when you wanna blow it down, oh
Hella high you can take a look around though
Might rain you might need an umbrella
Hella niggas out here grinding for the cheddar
Hella niggas out here grinding for they family
Hella niggas and they grinding for a Grammy
Hella girls if you out here tryna find one
Hella hoes for you, really find a diamond
