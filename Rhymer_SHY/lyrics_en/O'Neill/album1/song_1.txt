(Intro- O'Neill)
It's O'Neill
Yeah

(Verse One- O'Neill)
I'm sick with the rhymes, man nobody does it better
Yeah you rappers act soft but I ain't talking 'bout no feathers
I'm back on the mic just to shit on competition
And when I start rapping I was writing compositions
I make you quit rapping in a flash like a magician
For me that's fucking normal like I celebrate traditions
These people nowadays are too dumb to see the vision
I wish I could be heard so these people just listen
I put bar after bar yeah I been told you that
And killin' MC's on a track is just a task
Been writing so much so my lyrics stay in tack
All these bars that I be spitting be dangerous like its ?
No way you'll step to me, you a lame and thats a fact
I put my pain into these tracks, I go insane in all my raps
Being famous is just a trap, can't be tamed now thats a wrap
Lyrically trained to just attack, you on the chains but thats just crap

(Hook- O'Neill)
This the proof
'Cuz everytime I'm spitting its the muthafucking truth
These rappers ain't battle why you think that I'm amused
Give me any beat and Imma leave that shit abused
Snakes all around me yeah they leave ya boy fueld

(Verse Two- Killah Toni)
Killah Toni yeah my swagger is too fragrant
Sharp as a dagger with each one of my statements
A fragment of my fragrence smells too amazing
I repel the haters like Batman do Penguin
I get checks like a Nike sponsership
More respect than that man Carl Johnson get
Threats is a constant so I bring the bronson
When I'm responding thats the action, Awesome
I stay flossing like the dentist is watching
Pendants same color as the Spur color blocking
Its shocking when I go shopping they mocking
Until the cash register filled with hella profit
Relentless killah, so take caution
Demented and horrendous so no stopping
Tremendous blood spills but not a blemish on me
Embrass ya self tryna harm Killah Toni

(Hook- O'Neill)
This the proof
'Cuz everytime I'm spitting its the muthafucking truth
These rappers ain't battle why you think that I'm amused
Give me any beat and Imma leave that shit abused
Snakes all around me yeah they leave ya boy fueld
