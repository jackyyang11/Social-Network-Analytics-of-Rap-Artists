Verse 1; [Nick Brewer]
Hey yo, I rarely speak with that
Foul mouth, I never needed that
Bow down, I don't believe in that
Really a familiar feeling bringing the meaning back
Like it don't even matter nobody
Even the man that hold shotties
I splash 10 grand with no worries
You can ask them man, they don't worry
You can ask them man, they know me
Doing this thing from 03
Fall on pickets of gold and roll deep
Bound for the bound
Bound for the reload and the deal oh
Running the road I keep rolling
Never squeeze no gun in the holster no need
Ain't nothing I know I won't be
'Cause I saw something I know they don't see

Pre-Chorus; [Nick Brewer & Shakka]
So tell them I see you
Know that nobody can be you
I don't know why they be so bothered by you
(No way)
Bothered by you
(No)
But tell them I see you
Know that nobody can be you
(Aye)
I don't know why they be so bothered by you
(No way)
Bothered by you

Chorus; [Shakka]
Don't you know, I'm a pro
'Til I make my walking
Don't start talking
Oh don't you know, I'm a pro
Ain't no fake when balling
Nature's calling
I'm alright (yeah)
I'm alright (yeah)
Cloud nine (yeah) cloud nine
Oh don't you know, I'm a pro
'Til I make my walking
Don't start talking

Verse 2; [Nick Brewer]
Yeah I'm no gangster, no
Killer never saw a crack on road
Really I just hope that you know, ay
Reminiscing going back to back
But rap in the back of the black cab
Imagine that with my cap back
Looking bathed in natural fat
When he spat back I react to mine like
Blat, blat, blat, blat, blat
It didn't quite look right
Little good guy tryna be a hood guy
And I would write, nothing that I should write, like
Some mans don't like me
They try and bad mind me
I might be the man so I'm bout my speed
Just like Lee, a gang couldn't top my team
I find me a good trap
I was tryna find me a good time to see you

Pre-Chorus; [Nick Brewer & Shakka]
Know that nobody can be you
I don't know why they be so bothered by you
(No Way)
Bothered by you
But tell them I see you
Know that nobody can be you
I don't know why they be so bothered by you
(No way)
Bothered by you


Chorus; [Shakka]
Don't you know, I'm a pro
'Til I make my walking
Don't start talking
Oh don't you know, I'm a pro
Ain't no fake when balling
Nature's calling
I'm alright (yeah)
I'm alright (yeah)
Cloud nine (yeah) cloud nine
Oh don't you know, I'm a pro
'Til I make my walking
Don't start talking

(My boy's floatin')
Tryin' to do it properly
I don't wanna talk bad, I never walk bad
I never force that, it's not me

I never rap stuff I don't do
