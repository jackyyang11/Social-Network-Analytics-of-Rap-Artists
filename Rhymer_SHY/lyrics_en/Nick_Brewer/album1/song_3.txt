[Intro: Naomi Scott]
Oh na na, oh na na
Oh na na, oh na na
Oh na na, oh na na

[Verse 1: Nick Brewer]
My boy told me it's time to blow
And even though I wanna believe I'm ready, I don't know
I'm 24 but I'm going on like a five year-old
Dad's telling me that it's time that I buy a home
But right now I just wanna rap rhymes until my mind explodes
Because I really don't wanna be nothing
Here my mind's right, money's right, sippin' a bottle of somethin'
Yeah, nine times on a high, really I gotta be frontin'
I was just tryna blend in
Loads of the time I know I was pretending
Most of the guys I been roaming with've been penned in
Same guys I was riding bars with are behind bars
And it's kinda hard and now I found my heart beating kind of fast
And every time I start spitting rhymes I can't
It's like night time inside my mind is dark, I know
I don't know why but I can't let go

[Chorus: Naomi Scott]
What if I fall?
What if I fall from here?
The thought of it all is more than my heart can bear
Oh na na, oh na na
Why are we scared?
Oh na na, oh na na
Why do we fear?

[Verse 2: Nick Brewer]
I don't really know what I'm tryna prove
I just hope that I don't disguise the truth
Cause there were times I've been lying and I've realised that ain't the right type of move
I'm tired of being a nice guy to you
I don't want to be liked for the sake of it, I'd rather be hated and make you think
Cause if I stay silent it wouldn't change a thing
I go deep
And the truth is you might be afraid to swim
There's no need
I've got this, I promise
Let's grow together, we can accomplish anything and everything beyond what we ever wanted
How does that sound?
If that ain't what you want then I'll back down
Stand in the background
I'll black out
Never been that loud
I'm mad proud
Then when I act out
I [?]
I just figured it's better you know that I could never end up letting it go
And I'm telling you, so

[Chorus: Naomi Scott]
What if I fall?
What if I fall from here?
The thought of it all is more than my heart can bear
Oh na na, oh na na
Why are we scared?
Oh na na, oh na na
Why do we fear?

[Bridge: Nick Brewer]
Feeling jaded, if it's fading let's evade it
Let's get faded off the taste of [?]
And frustration be the basis of impatience
But we learn from our mistakes, we don't erase them
Feeling jaded, if it's fading let's evade it
Let's get faded off the taste of [?]
And frustration be the basis of impatience
But we learn from our mistakes, we don't erase them

[Outro: Naomi Scott]
What if I fall?
What if I fall from here?
The thought of it all
Oh na na, oh na na
Oh na na, oh na na
