[Intro]
Respect me but don't forget me, yo
I come with the technique like say I’m Jet Li, yo
I just wanna bring out the vibe, they won't let me, no
(Wait, hold up)
They say they get me but they don't get me though

[Verse 1]
You get me though just let me go
You come with that jump in the whip but there ain’t no perpetual flow
No gas, no gas, no Texaco
Whoa
I'm stuntin' like next to blow, get to know, winter shoes at the festival
Check the flow
Dumb down and run 'round these other rappers, and another rapper
Sittin' for a million minutes ready to get it
(Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it)
I can never really begin and let alone finish
(Finish, finish, finish, finish)
I do it 'til I did it
(Did it, did it, did it)
I do it how they didn't wanna do it, now I live it
(Live it, live it, live it, live it, live it, live it)

[Chorus]
Respect me but don't forget me, yo
I come with the technique like say I’m Jet Li, yo
I just wanna bring out the vibe, they won’t let me, no
(Wait, hold up)
They say they get me but they don't get me though
Respect me but don’t forget me, yo
I come with the technique like say I'm Jet Li, yo
I just wanna bring out the vibe, they won't let me, no
(Wait, hold up)
They say they get me but they don't get me though

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, you get me though?
Oh lord I’ma win it
Oh, you get me though?
Sittin' for a million minutes ready to get it
(Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it)
Ay

[Verse 2]
The mind that me given got me trapped, got me seeking my visions in facts
And I ain't got a strap but brap
I remember telling my dad I wanted to rap
He looked at me all baffed like, 'son are you mad?'
I shrugged my shoulders and told him 'perhaps'
But anyway
I can never bend the [?] of a renegade
I don't never get away I'ma demonstrate
Anything they ever say you can let them hate
No one ever frettin' me
But I don't ever want to be frontin'
I can talk if we're talking bout nothing
No discussing I'ma ride on my own, mind my own, I got a mind of my own
Find a zone writing rhymes on my phone
I'm alone [?]
I know life's [?] the highs and lows
Good women disguised as hoes
And guys too light, they ain't got dough, but you still see them in designer clothes
Life's [?] the highs and lows
Good women disguised as hoes
And guys too light, they ain't got dough, but you still see them in designer clothes

[Chorus]
Respect me but don't forget me, yo
I come with the technique like say I'm Jet Li, yo
I just wanna bring out the vibe, they won't let me, no
(Wait, hold up)
They say they get me but they don't get me though
Respect me but don't forget me, yo
I come with the technique like say I'm Jet Li, yo
I just wanna bring out the vibe, they won't let me, no
(Wait, hold up)
They say they get me but they don't get me though

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, you get me though?
Oh lord I'ma win it
Oh, you get me though?
Oh lord I'ma win it

[Outro]
Sittin' for a million minutes ready to get it
(Get it, get it, get it, get it)
Ay
I can never really begin and let alone finish
(Finish, finish, finish, finish)
I do it 'til I did it
(Did it, did it, did it, did it)
I do it how they didn't wanna do it, now I live it
(Live it, live it, live it, live it)
A man wanna drag me under the bus
Never that, I ain't slippin'
Oh lord I'ma win it, ay
Oh lord I'ma win it, ay
Oh lord I'ma win it, ay
