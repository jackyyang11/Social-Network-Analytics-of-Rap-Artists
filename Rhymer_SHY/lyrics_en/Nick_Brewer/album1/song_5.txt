[Verse 1]
Check it
You ain't gotta like it but respect it
Said I wasn't a bad boy and I meant it
Raised on the east side of the city
Left at the next exit
Close to the dog trap
Man are holding a lot but I really want on that
I was there sitting in my house
Wanting to make it out
Really my thoughts filling me with doubt
Chilling on the couch
Banging out tunes for the man there
Tryna find my path, it weren't that clear
In a place where rhyme man not survive
What am I supposed to do? Stand there?
When that's not roo
I get to watch when they banged at you
Can't lie, could've got slapped up too
Sitting in stoods
They were like 'Wait, wait, jack that tune'

[Hook]
Turn my headphones up
I been out here from the get go cuz
Riding around on a ped, no clutch
Suppling food like Tesco does
Them pagans never get no love
No kiss, no hug, no XO
Look, man are bad man 'cause I said so
And I'm in a AirMax tracksuit, no, I don't dress retro

[Verse 2]
Keep my head real low
Way before them man stole my flow
Some other guy stole my mobile phone
I was on the road with two friends in my new ends
Figuring out the right way home
They surrounded us, it got peak
I got robbed by them and I clocked right then
That bad boy life weren't me
Oh, what a chief, not one part of me was on beef
Don't think that you can't believe me on beats
'Cause I mean every word that I say
If you don't relate, it's not deep
You see me though
Little man talk tough but they really though
Few hood friends chilling in a video
Never thought like this, second caught my drift
If I talk like this will they hear me though?

[Hook]
Turn my headphones up
I been out here from the get go cuz
Riding around on a ped, no clutch
Suppling food like Tesco does
Them pagans never get no love
No kiss, no hug, no XO
Look, man are bad man 'cause I said so
And I'm in a AirMax tracksuit, no, I don't dress retro

Turn my headphones up
I been out here from the get go cuz
Riding around on a ped, no clutch
Suppling food like Tesco does
Them pagans never get no love
No kiss, no hug, no XO
Look, man are bad man 'cause I said so
And I'm in a AirMax tracksuit, no, I don't dress retro

[Verse 3]
Man check, lemme dissect
[?] a man get
Tryna get hot in every bar
Even though we're mad beat fast
I'm on the same roads
Too bait be on the main roads
That's why you see we're rolling in plain clothes
And I carry the heater when it ain't cold
Fam, it's hot round here
Yeah, man'll do a lot round here
Where you from cuz? No, it's not round here
So you flick now through a gunshot round here
I seen man rock round here
I can't let it be
I'm scared but I can't let 'em see
I'm finding it harder to breathe
I'm having panic attacks, I'm trapped
They gotta bellies on strap
I gotta figure how to really relax
These nightmares are my fares
I'm more than quite scared
I'm wishing I could sit in my high chair and cry here
I've seen too many men die but a game never started my life
Tell me that it's gonna be alright, please
'Cause I'm losing my G's
Can't really find peace
Otherwise I'm gonna be stuck
Going through stuff
Get in the booth in the crib like

[Hook]
Turn my headphones up
