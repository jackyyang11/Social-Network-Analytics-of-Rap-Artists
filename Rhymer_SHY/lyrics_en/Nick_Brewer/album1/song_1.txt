[Verse 1: Nick Brewer]
Yeah, I really want to talk to her
Slide in the DM's like it's sport, you know
I just said hi, she must have seen the blue tick and replied
I guess that I'm fortunate
Shoot my shot anywhere from the floor
And what?
Fourth quarter with the Jordan shot
You man bricked, built a war you lost
I celebrate with the awkward 'bot
Man I bought, bought, bought
She asked what I do, I said a lot, lot, lot
"How about you?" I saw dot, dot, dot
Then it disappeared?
Guess I flop, flop, flopped
Ah it's all mad, mad, mad
Missed a free throw that I had, that's sad
Shoulda been cool, got gassed and ah
Same Nick with the same black [?]

[Chorus: FAVELA]
I think of all the words and things I wish I'd said and done
All eyes on me and I think I'm the only one
Trying to reel back all destruction rolling off my tongue
Can you keep my head up ah, and keep me movin' on

[Verse 2: Nick Brewer]
But why'd I have to get cocky?
Took a L, don't let it get to your head, Bobby
Said I could be a triple double threat, probably
Why I still got my ex, ex, ex, ex, ex, ex on me?
Guess I'm good with it
I want a matte black whip with the wood finish
Yeah, I shoulda quit when I could, innit?
But anybody can get Drake, the Push did it
Whoa, that was a low blow
There's no holes in the flow let your bro know
I'm nothing like the ozone
This girl follow a man back
But she didn't even like one photo
Damn, still she threw man an alley-oop
Imma do what I do, gotta put it in the hoop
With the back door [?] get the [?] one, too
Mic check, let me check--
I'm the man, one two

[Chorus: FAVELA]
I think of all the words and things I wish I'd said and done
All eyes on me and I think I'm the only one
Trying to reel back all destruction rolling off my tongue
Can you keep my head up ah, and keep me movin' on

[Bridge: FAVELA]
And then the feeling fades away
And I'm feeling whole again
Still I remember it's just me and then it's
Gone

[Chorus: FAVELA]
I think of all the words and things I wish I'd said and done
All eyes on me and I think I'm the only one
Trying to reel back all destruction rolling off my tongue
Can you keep my head up ah, and keep me movin' on

[Outro]
Yo, I don't wanna waste your time
I'm really tryna hold it down
Wow, how did we get right here?
We're coming like lost and found
Yo, I don't wanna waste your time
I'm really tryna hold it down
Wow, how did we get right here?
We're coming like lost and found
