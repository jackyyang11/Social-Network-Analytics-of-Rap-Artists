[Hook: Nick]
Respect me but don't forget me, yo
I come with the technique like say I'm Jet Li, yo
I just wanna bring out the vibe, they won't let me, no
(Wait, hold up) They say they get me but they don't get me though

[Verse 1: Nick]
They don't understand me, but that's handy
Sitting in my yard figuring a plan B
I can't talk like the man of the moment
I ain't standing on road with the man that I know
And I ain't banging a chrome with the bally, I know
Like to say that I have an involvement with the man on the road
It's no Biggie and 2Pac, I just wanna bring the truth back, let me do that
I don't wanna spit a few raps, tryna talk like a don
I've been alone with my thoughts all along
See, I don't know what you thought of the boy
And now I don't know what you thought I was on
But give me a beat, I spit on the beat, I wanted to weep
And still I'm chilling like I sit on the beat
Familiar feat, I'm pretty discreet
It's silly of me but really I mean
I know there's something that you waited to see

[Hook: Nick](x2)

Sitting for a million minutes ready to get it

[Verse 2: Ghetts]
Respect me
A nigga Bruce Lee for these Jet Lis
I'm like a room full of 1210s
Too many techniques
I've been on the mountain with shaolins
Man who have names you'd have problems pronouncing
Crouching tiger when I'm pouncing
Two on one, and still no matching me
Actually, that ain't a match, that's counseling
Don't ask who I think the top ten spitters are
I be like number one, me
Two? Sorry, I got problems counting
Nowadays man are in off a freestyle
In my day, to meet the criteria
Freestyles, mixtapes, singles, albums
Buzz, workrate, it's simple now, man
Light work for a man that likes work
Spitting for a million minutes ready to get it
Still got a million lyrics I never said
Metaphors for a million listens till you get em
You hear what I said fam? Mad ting
GH and Nick Brewer
Ah, you never knew I knew him cause he's newer
But we was both underground in a sewer

[Hook: Nick](x2)

[Verse 3/Bridge: Nick]
Oh, you get me though
Oh Lord, I'm a winner
Oh, you get me though
Oh Lord, I'm a winner
Sitting for a million minutes ready to get it
I ain't ever really beginning, let alone finished
I do it till I did it
I do it how they didn't wanna do it, now I live it
And man wanna drag me under the bars
Never that, I ain't slipping
Oh Lord, I'm a winner
Oh Lord, I'm a winner
Oh Lord, I'm a winner
Oh Lord, I'm a winner
