[Hook]
Let's celebrate
You know I really wanna celebrate
Look, everybody's gotta celebrate
Let's toast to the good decisions that we never made, that we never made
Still, I wanna celebrate
I really hope that me and you can celebrate
Don't worry if you're feeling low, we can levitate
Let's celebrate, let's celebrate

[Verse 1]
I find nowadays, I celebrate less
They killed Osama, now we celebrate death
They killed Gadaffi and everybody was happy
Like we all became assassins, why it never made sense
It's really feeling like a ready-made mess
I don't know why we couldn't let em take breath
My mum's feeling mad pressure at her workplace
I wish that she could delegate stress, let her take less
But I wanna make a toast
And celebrate all the people I love the most
Cause there's been a couple highs, couple lows
Couple times I was struggling with life and they know
Yeah, but they were there really
I didn't have a lot, they were willing to share with me
They like it when I'm happy cause I'm me
And that's the type of guy I wanna be, so

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I can't lie, I'm feeling blue
Cause I just saw Stephen Lawrence's mother on the news
And now she's seeking justice after such a long time
But she's saying that she can't celebrate and it's true
But was a life snatched by another five
Mother cried tears from the acts of the other guys
And I don't know why he really had to suffer, why?
And I can see the pain in his mother's eyes
But I don't wanna dwell on all the negatives
Bad things happen, I ain't acting like they never did
9/11, 7/7, I'm remembering
All of the pain, man, it's a shame they didn't get to live
But I ain't reminiscing for the hell of it
We've all got a story, I'm just one of many telling it
And I know I didn't value it at times
But I just wanna celebrate life

[Hook]

[Outro]
Don't let them tell you that you're worth nothing
Celebrate the fact that you're worth something
Forget the lies that you heard, you deserve more
Let's celebrate what we've worked for
