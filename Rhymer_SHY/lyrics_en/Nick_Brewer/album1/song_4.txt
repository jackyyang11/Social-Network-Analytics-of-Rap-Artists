[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'm just trying to forget you, yeah
Trying to forget you, yeah
But it ain't really workin', though
So nowadays I pretend to, yeah
George told me to move on
Louis told me I'm headstrong
Dad said it's a new year
And this could be the best one
And I'm hoping he's right though
But you're still on my mind though
Last year I was so, so low
Didn't hit no high notes
But I been feedin' my mind with premium vibes
Been reading my Bible
Just read Revelation, whoa
I know this life ain't fire, though
Just went to my aunt's funeral
Second one that I've been to this year
My boy's getting married in three months
And it's making me wish that you were here
Life ain't crystal, just clear
Got caught off guard and walked 'round past
But I heard somewhere that life ain't real if it's not hard
So what now?

[Chorus]
Time I forget you?
Maybe I should forget you
Why can't I forget you?

[Verse 2]
Yeah, feels weird now that you ain't in the picture
Last week at the league you took pics on my Insta
We made some memories
Now I'm erasing memories
But it ain't that simple
I'm doubting they'll ever leave
And we ain't enemies, really I know
But that's the way that it goes
Remember the days we were taking it slow?
Now heartache's takin' its toll
Like, babe, let me go
Let me go
Let me go
Nick, let it go
I talk to myself on the low
'Cause I know that you're nowhere near
You're over there and I'm over here
Fam, I'm in Istanbul right now
Swivelin' in my studio chair
But life goes on
The grind don't stop
Babies are born
And lives been lost
Maybe it's a sign that our time was up
And it ain't what I want, but it's time I forget you

[Chorus]
Time I forget you
Maybe I should forget you
Why can't I forget you?

[Match Announcer 1 & Announcer 2]
Oh dear, oh dear me
And here is a moment that almost brings tears to his eyes--
No, you're quite right, he IS bringing the tears
Look at him, he's shattered

[Verse 2]
Wish I could say I'm the same
But life don't change though
I don't know what's stranger
The fact that we feel like strangers
Or the fact that you still fill my brain up
Well, let me get up to speed
Because the last six months have some ups
Indeed I get down sometimes
I wish you were around sometimes
Probably said that a thousand times
Asked your [?] friend, a manager
[?] yes lord, [?] don't talk to me no more
And that's unfortunate, oh lord
I don't even know why
I tried calling his phone but you won't bite
And [?] man, it's all right
I've got a lot of good people in my life
I find god through them daily
Maybe I thought what would break me will actually save me
The label set me free and still paid me
I don't even know why man it's crazy
Anyway, I saw that your sis' got engaged
Had a big smile on my face, happy days
You know I got love for your whole fam like they're my own, man
If only we were on the same page
I heard that you moved house
I don't know where you're living but I hope that it feels like home to you
I'm still in my zone
And I know that I've grown
Better yet, that I've still got loads to do
And that's that
