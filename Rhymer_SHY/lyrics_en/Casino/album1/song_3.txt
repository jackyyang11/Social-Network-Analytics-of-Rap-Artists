(Hook : Casino)
She say she love the way my chain swang
She say she like my whip game
She say we wrap the same thang
She say I never changed I stay the same
Can't resist that i'm killin' shit(x4)

(Verse 1 : Casino)
I killed em' when I dropped that Ex Drug Dealer
I killed em' cause they thought I couldn't do it nigga
I killed em' when they said I wasn't no hood nigga
Then I showed up at my show with them hood niggas
I gotta couple mil on the low, ain't a hood that I can't go
Lost 100 grand to cee-lo
