[Intro]
Yeah
Dee-1
Forgive em
For they know not what they do
Look

[Verse 1]
Catchin' what they pitchin'
Learn from repetition
They got no mission vision
So I question they intentions
Who are you?
I'm paranoid, everybody's a sinner
If you ain't on the mission I'm on
You'z An Ene-My
I know some people that's real
Don't ask me how I'm doing
You don't care how I feel
You just plottin on my paper
You catch my girl slippin
You'll try to take her
That's what you pray for
That's why...
I look a man in his eyes
He ain't nothing to me
I see the spirit in that man
Now that's something to see
Satan sparring with the Godfather
We just pawns in this chess game
Of law and order
That's why I be like

[Hook]
Our father, who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy name
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven
Give us this day our daily bread
And forgive those who trespass against us
What you tell em now?
Against us, against us
They ain't trynna go
Against us, against us
They don't want it, no
Against us, against us
They don't wanna know
Against us, against us
We some gangstas


[Verse 2]
Uno
Look, I love everybody
I don't like most of em
Why?
The main ones you gotta watch
Be close to ya
Black people we tore up from the floor up
Backstabbin, conniving and plotting
We need to grow up
Every rapper talkin' about takin somebody girl
Everything on TV oversexualized
Man I really hate this world
Black people robbing black people
Black people killin more black people
These are facts people
Looking at my own people
Wondering if they plottin
Smile so bright, heart so rotten
Pick you apart like cotton
We new slaves hanging ourselves minus the noose
Oops! I'm signed but still spitting the truth
I got to...
And to tell you the truth
I ain't even mad
Cause satan sparring with the Godfather throwing jabs
You speak about peace, they think that you weak
If we ain't on the same mission
Can't let you too close to me

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Mission Vision
Gangstas, Thuggas, Hustlas
Ballas, Shinas, Stunnas, Real shot callas
Texas, Cali and New Orleans
Mississippi down to Florida

[Verse 3]
Went from zero flipped to a kilo
And did it legal and the people
Call that a hero
They need a pillow and a mattress
They sleeping on me, a boxspring
Came out swinging in the winter
Then I had to box spring
Look here
My locks hang to my waistline
Represent the patience and determination
I ain't here to waste time
Take time, digest these great rhymes
They'll get you high as some purp in 6 seconds
That's a grapevine
Man it's nothing to me
These people frontin on me
They stuntin on me
Man what I'm 'pose to do
So much drama erryday
I just put my hands together
Bow my head, look in the sky and say

[Hook]
