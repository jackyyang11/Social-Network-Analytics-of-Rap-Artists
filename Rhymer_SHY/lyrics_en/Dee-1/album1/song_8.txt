[Hook]
World turns blue, when the world turns blue

[Verse 1]
Look, I rock the double rosary cause I got double foes opposing me
Sometimes it's hard to deal with the fact that my God has chosen me
Supposedly the real is back, the fake gon have to deal with that
I like to give an order of substance and add some skill with that
Caps are still peeling back, cats is still dealing crack
Walking round with chips on they shoulders and getting killed with that
To one man it's a nightmare, but the next man is living that
A couple cats make it out the hood, most ain't giving back
Pastor, preacher smelling like that marijuana aroma
Shorty body developing early, the whole hood want her
On her cell phone, texting late at night
Some dude that's twice her age, he ready to give her the pipe--I hate it!
But you's a fool if you ignore or debate it
It's not that cats isn't learning, they just miseducated
Ask people how they doing, they say "I'm just tryna make it"
They say they starving, I left 'em food for thought
You think they ate it?

World turns blue, when the world turns blue

[Verse 2]
I'm still here
One of my friends said I'm changing
Changing?! Nahh boo I ain't changing, just a lil more famous
Lucky? Never dat, I beg to differ
My journey's like a movie, cats is finally seeing the big picture
And the same folks who doubted when I was reaching out
See that what they saw was a star, funny how that seesaw evens out, huh?!
You know you got a lot of pride built up
When you just hear a beat come on, and yo eyes tear up
But I'm just thinking bout all the sacrifices that were made
All the dues that were paid
All the people I forgave
Writing songs like a slave
Best friends in the grave
Love life in disarray, should I leave? Should I stay?
No such thing as running away, ya'll better check my resume
Day to day, I just pray God'll make my life OK
And I don't need a buffet, I just need a decent plate
Scratch that!
I want it all, man it's time to make something shake

[Hook]
World turns blue, when the world turns blue

[Verse 3]
I'm still here
Don't come to me with yo palms out, I'm not a human debit card
When King David write these books to Psalms, they all prophetic, dawg
The pressure'll drive you crazy, that's if you let it, dawg
You stand for something real, they treat you like crack, you get it hard
Forget it dawg, you don't get it dawg, then quit it, dawg
All these black millionaires, how many hoods benefited, dawg?!
Sometimes they make me wanna get my black fitted, dawg
Black shirt, black jeans then knock 'em off they pivot, dawg
Right now, as I'm writing, my money's short as a midget, dawg
But gimme a minute dawg, ima be there in a minute, dawg
I'm in this game to win it, dawg
Finna run it like Emmitt, dawg
They done gave me the ball, ain't no time to be timid, dawg
I said I want it all and I meant it, dawg
Sorry, it's my turn, you can't prevent it, dawg
Lord of the land, call me landlord
I'm here evicting tenants, dawg
If you fake, your run is over
Cause I'm here to end it, dawg
