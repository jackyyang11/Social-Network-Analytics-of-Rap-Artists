AK on yo’ night stand
No no no no no no noooooo, Why you lyin’
AK on your nightstand, Right next to dat bible
Well you should pick that word up, Cause you ain’t pickin up that rifle
Brag about your money, Cause you really got dat’
But don’t talk ‘bout that gun play, Unless you talkin’ ‘bout Maybach
See my lil’ homies bump you , And my lil’ dawgs look up to you
But your food for thought don’t fill em up, Like like like like lunchables
If you comfortable, Get uncomfortable
See it’s only bout income for you
But when that money slow up, you’ll grow up
Yeah them bills with the Cause be, no huxtable

Oh Let’s do it, quit talkin’
Let’s meet in Hollygrove for coffee
And talk about RIP, that’s dead lyin’ in coffins
You make money off lies, You a scammer or nah?
Your light's turning dark, You a tanner or nah?
This is brain food, Can you handle or nah?
Like How you want your eggs, Scrambled or nah?

Like I’m standing in awe, man you got a whole generation confused
That’s a bad look and it’s stuck on you, like a terrible tattoo
When the time is up, and grind is over, and the blinders off, ain’t no hiding soldier
You had all this influence, but who did you inspire soldier ?

Chorus X2
Look at you, now look at us
All my dawgs’ll call your bluff
All my dawgs’ll call your bluff
All my dawgs’ll call your bluff

I don’t never get tired, No I got fire endurance
And I ain’t going to hell, Look I got fire insurance
I got that Iphone 8, And noticed your songs won’t play
I asked why not, They told me cause it come with liar insurance
Don’t mislead these kids, Look at the man in the mirror
I can’t say it no clearer, Boy you ain’t no killa
I can’t make you change your life, And ain’t with ya every night
But big dawg, You been barkin’ way more than your bite


All I’m sayin’
If you don’t sell dope, Don’t say that then
If you don’t kill folk, Don’t say that then
I remember when I used to believe what you said
That was long time ago doe, Way back when
That was back when I used to work at Circuit City
And you came in, to get a T.V, for your SUV, and I brought it out, and met my favorite Lil Weezy

I was in high school, I ain’t rap back then
Zap back then, You was on the map back then
Memorized every word that you spat back then
I was honored just to give you dap back then
But I’m good in my skin, I’m so happy, I’m not him
I see him, I hear him, I listen, I’m nodding
The music is catchy, but most of it’s lyin
And that is why pound for pound, I know I got heem
