[Intro]
One love, keep it real it all times, sometimes too real
And when you see them 3’s up
Man, you already know
Already know what that means (yeah, yeah)

[Hook]
Now when you see them 3’s up you know what they represent
Be real, be righteous, be relevant (3x)
Now when you see them 3’s up you know what they represent
Be real, be righteous, be relevant (3x)

[Verse 1]
I live it more than I talk it
Walk it more than I bark it
Standing for something real
So I made myself a target
Yelling “I HOPE THEY HEAR ME!!!”
Well, I think they heard us
From those who flip burgers
To the white-collar rich burglars
I got a purpose, it got the enemy nervous
But God gave me the stage, it’s a must that I flourish
Giving ‘em courage even when they discouraged
Me no feed ‘em lies
Feed ‘em brain food- get ‘em nourished
It tastes so good, this go from my hood to yo’ hood
I’m up to greatness I’m up to no good
I coulda been rich, but that’s another story
I’m tryna do it in a way to bring my mother glory
And bring my father honor
They call me Jeffrey Dahmer
Eating wack rappers alive, I’m the hip hop piranha
And when I say wack, I don’t mean your rhymes wack
I mean your content sucks, I can’t co-sign that
Look at these mean mugs
Man everytime I come around everybody got these mean mugs
I be like “What’s up with these mean mugs?”
They be like “Dee, why smile?
Man, you know how long it’s been since I seen love?”
10% of people live the life they dreamed of
The other 90 make the best with what they got
I don’t focus on the not the negative or the no
I just focus on the top, I gotta get it
Let’s go

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yo, see what I taught him in 6th grade, it set in by the 7th
He applied it by 8th so he was mature as a freshman
Then sophomore year he kinda got off track
His family problems had me thinking ‘bout adopting that cat
But I didn’t cuz I was going through some things of my own
I was inconsistent and we lost touch before long
Look, then two years later man I tell you no lie
I was walking on Canal when I ran into my guy
The teardrops under his eyes brought teardrops to my eyes
The teardrops under his eyes brought teardrops to my eyes, look
I took my hands and tried to wipe ‘em away
He said “Nah big brother, them there here to stay”
Hey, what you expect when you neglect an adolescent
That’s already a wreck from Compton to Tibet
We got the tender lives of these youngsters in our hands
And I know that I done dropped the ball before, man

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yo, I’m finna pour out my heart on the third verse please
My homie got a disease that’ll make most people…freeze
Or fall to they knees, you knows how it be’s
What kills most people he handles with ease
And when it comes to spiritual matters, we real different
We argue for hours, in the end we still feel different
See, I believe in God and he don’t so we don’t see eye to eye
But we won’t be blinded by the evil
That try to divide the people whose minds collide for peace so
We try to find equal ground to stand on
See God is love and love is God
So the love I show my man might guide him to God
Who woulda thought?
I’d rather be a walking testimony than a talking phony, homie
But I’ll holla at you in the next song
Cuz right now, I’m too deep in the zone
