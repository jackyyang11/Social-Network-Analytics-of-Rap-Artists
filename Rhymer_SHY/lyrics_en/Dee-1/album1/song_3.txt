[Verse 1]
I'm at my homeboys funeral, I'm staring in his casket
His eyes are closed he lays motionless
His mother's face flooded with tears
I kiss her on her forehead, as they confirm her worst fears
I saw him changing since the seventh grade
We were both good students with bright futures ahead
He was a smart dude who didn't know what to do
Cuz where we from being smart ain't cool, sad but true
I noticed his grades slipped, cuz he stopped trying
Noticed he started stealing, Noticed he started lying
Noticed he started thuggin'
Noticed he was changing
But I didn't say nothing, cuz I didn't wanna sound lame
And I'm hating myself
As I stare at his dead face
Feel like if I said something he wouldn't be dead
I watch him fall off right before my eyes
And now I can't forgive myself, hard as I try

[Hook: Ambush and Alexis Jones]
I check my watch every hour
As time winds down before I leave
I'm looking at decisions that I'm making
And asking who do I aim to please
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Is it you is it them is it me?
What is it to gain the world, but loose the ones you love?


[Verse 2: Dee 1]
Boy meets girl, boy likes girl, girl likes boy
They become a couple
Girl tells boy that she is a virgin
Heavy into church, spiritual immersion
Boy digs that, Boy understands
But boy knows afterness is hard for a man
Who already ain't pure, but boy loves girl
They pledge to abstain, numb to the world
The was on the same page but day after day
Waiting became hard that's when girl prayed
That when she was weak, she would be strong
And when he was weak, she would be strong
They still tried to wait but that didn't last long
It felt so right but she felt so wrong
Eventually we broke up, I'm sorry I took that from you
It's been killing me, so it's time I spoke up
