[Intro Dee-1]
Yea...If you real you gon' feel me

[Hook Dee-1]
I know some folk who break they neck, and not for a check
I know some folk who break they neck, and not for respect
I know some folk who break they neck, and not for they pride
They break they neck for attention, they gon' end up paralyzed

[Verse 1 Dee-1]
Look, one thing I know about attention it's a delicate thing
So be mindful of the problems that attention can bring
It'll tear between crews, like a surgical knife
...man, what's so special 'bout dude, why him in the limelight?

Females begin to fight, thats why they rarely be hangin'
Too many dudes hollerin' at one, the others be hatin'
Now, they all talkin' about each other behind each others backs
...that's why I don't like that b****, she think she all that

Oh yea, and it'll make you a target if you ain't cautious
That new whip just made you a target soon as you bought it
Them big shiny rims, yeah, they gon' cause some problems
...oh homie don' came up now
I know you hear 'em plottin'

Scottie Pippen was the ultimate team mate so I applaud him
Cause he know he was a star, but he knew he wasn't Jordan
And I know some nights he felt overshadowed at the top
He dropped 36...but, MJ just hit the winning shot
People steady in yo' ear sayin' that you should leave
But he played his role for the greater good of the team

Everybody eatin', that's how it's supposed to go
But, once you start measurin' yo' plate next to his...
Then it's over folk

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 2 Dee-1]
When I bring this gun to school I bet you that'll get some attention
The teacher won't forget my name then, no sir
And all the kids who made fun of me, caught themselves punchin' me
I bet they'll all run from me, yup, I'm so sure

When I let him break my virgin, betcha' you that'll get some attention
He'll love me like he never ever loved me before
I'll just slide down these pants, and get into his trance
And let him get inside, and he'll never let me go

When I join this gang, I'll betcha' that get some attention
They'll see me in the streets, and respect they'll my mind
Cause my kind we the baddest, everybody know what's happenin'
If you reppin' the wrong colors don't cross that line

Now, I'm locked up for murder doin' life, and I'm stressed
Now, I'm pregnant with a son and my dude already left
Somebody killed me for my shoes, now I'm fresh to death
But, I got the attention I wanted nevertheless

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 3 Sunni Patterson]
We seekin' somethin', but gainin' nothin'
Cause all to often broken hearts, they lead to broken souls
Yeah and I suppose it looks good in the beginnin'
Seems like you're livin'
Until the spendin' start to end and all your kindred
They just get lost off in the wind, and left unfulfilled
And in the bottom of the belly

If we could only listen to the secret's our mama's tell us
We thinkin' hell, is really heaven
And heaven just a question to be answered, not a blessin' to be savored
Lord, save us from the wrath of a world gone cold
So much is movin', but real love is on hold
So, I propose that we go back to the beginning
Before the ceiling, started cavin' in, and we were spinning out of control
When we were so young, so beautiful
So bold, so curious, so close to God
Before we got robbed of our innocence, gave into the ignorance
Seekin' attention from a system that could care less if we was dead or alive

Suffer to survive, my Lord what you do to get by, destroyin' our dreams
Prince into a phenes, and jealousy and green, make a nigga do things
Lord, just take us back up to the source, the one force
Forever lovin', forever livin', forever givin' more, forever open doors
For every reminder that you can fly, you can soar
Just remember who you are
(Mm, this feels good, swear to God)
...don't ya know you a star
