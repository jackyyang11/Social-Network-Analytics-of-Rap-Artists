[Intro]
We gotta ball, hustle, stack, flip
Uno

[Verse]
Balling like I was Pippen, flossing like it's my mission
All glory to God, He put me in this position
Potna if you ain't winning, in the hood we don't listen
Thin I ain't getting money, I would say you was tripping
All of it's legal though, ain't no flipping chickens in kitchens
It's hard to fit in my pockets so pardon me if I'm livid
Now if I fall in love with this money, that's when I'm sinning
Behind a green piece of paper, I ain't losing my religion
[?] on the beat, [?] dancing like New Addition
I'm in that '98 Honda, oh this ain't the new addition
Now I could buy a Lamborgini yeah, a new addition
But it's gon depreciate the second it's driven
I rather see my money investing, stacking and flipping
I get a rush out of turning 10 G's to a million
Knowing you came from nothing to something's a lovely feeling
I'm just using the talents the Almighty has given

[Hook]
Ball, hustle, stack, flip
Mula, bread, dinero, chips
Ball, hustle, stack, flip
Double, triple, never quit
If you do it for your momma, do what you do
If you a real Big Tymer, do what you do
If you came from the bottom, do what you do
Now you're shining [?], do what you do
