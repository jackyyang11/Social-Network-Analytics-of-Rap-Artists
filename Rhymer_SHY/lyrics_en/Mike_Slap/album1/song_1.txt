[Verse 1]
I know one day you gonna walk on down the street
And see another man you want more than me
He gonna have fancy hair
He gonna talk with the flair
You gon' see something you need, yeah

And though I know I'm man enough
To go and grab him by the scruff
There ain't really nothing I can do, No no
Cause the minute you lay eyes on him
That's when everything begins
I know cause that's how I met you

[Bridge]
Oh dear my heart is open wider than it's ever been
It's clear that I'm in love with you
(in love with you)
If ever you would to find much more of a clever man
Beyond forever I'll be blue
(for-ev-er)

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I don't want no promises
Don't matter what your mama says
I can't help feeling like I feel
I know you never lied to me
Still there's this voice inside of me
And I can't tell if what it's telling me is true

[Chorus]
I don't want to fall in love with you
Cause everything that I dream of turns blue, blue, blue
I can't just give you my heart, oh no no
When those feelings start I let go go go go

[Verse 2]
Despite my confidence
Inside I know I'm not the man
That you will be with forever more
I see it every now and then, the way you look at other men
One day you'll stumble out that door, yeah

And though I know I'm quick as hell
I'll never catch you if you fell
If you fell half as hard as how you fell for me
A love like ours is hard to find
But I can't sow your heart to mine
I feel like I'm racing time

[Pre-Chorus]
I never wanted to fall in love. I was doing well
One look at you and I was there
Oh damn I feel like you've been cast under a witch's spell
One that will make you disappear

[Chorus]
I don't want to fall in love you with you
Cause everything that I dream of turns blue, blue, blue
I can't just give you my heart, oh no no
When those feelings start I let go go go go

I don't want to fall in love you with you
Cause everything that I dream of turns blue, blue, blue
I can't just give you my heart, oh no no
When those feelings start I let go go go go

I let go
I let go
I let go
I let go
I let go
Ooh oh ohoo
I let go
I let go, go
Ooh oh ohoo
I let go
Yeah, I let go
I let go
