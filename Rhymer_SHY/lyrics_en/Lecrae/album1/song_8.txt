[Intro: Tasha Catour]
All I need is you
All I need is you

[Verse 1: Lecrae & Tasha Catour]
Keep me in my timezone when my mind's gone
When I'm flying home
And I'm stressed out and I'm tempted to get that styrofoam
And go pour it up, but you know what's up
And you know that ain't gone solve nothing
I mean Lord forbid I might fall or something
And I'm all or nothing cause (all I need is you)
To hold me down like bed straps to the psych ward
It's killing me but you still with me when I fight hard
And (all I need is you)
You digging me when I'm 'igging you
Get with me when my card's pulled
Coulda dealt with me but you fell for me 'fore I fell for you (all I need is you
To keep me on that right path and the right math
Cause you plus nothing is everything
You my everything, saying
(All I need is)
You, ain't gotta question my allegiance
Cause the way you love me I could never leave ya, I need ya

[Hook: Dustin "DAB" Bowie & Tasha Catour]
(All I need is you)
By my side, thick and thin
Highs and lows, don't let go (all I need is)
We gon' ride, we gon' win
Don't know how, all I know
(All I need is you)

[Bridge: Dustin "DAB" Bowie & Tasha Catour]
You, you're all I ever needed
You're all I ever needed
(All I need is)
You, you're all I ever needed
You're all I ever needed
(All I need is you)

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
How did I fall in this?
No condition that get a mention but you offered this  (all I need is)
Unconditional love, I swear I sell it all for this
I'm tryna keep it together, forgive my awkwardness (all I need is you)
But umm, often it's just you and me off in this
Valley of shadows and I know they trying to pick me off in this
But all I need is you
It's funny just how off I get when I ain't riding with you
No adjectives for your awesomeness
They burning one for that burn out
This life in God, I'm all turnt out
Took time out to put time in so I turn to you when I'm worn out
All I need is you
You slow me down cause you know me now with my phony smile
And I'm acting like it's all copacetic
It's so pathetic, so juvenile
Know what you do
You keep me cool in the summer
When they be dressing less and I be wanting to show off and stunt
There ain't nothing to want, you give me all that I need (all I need is you)
All I need is you to keep that fire burning for me
All I need is you (you)

[Hook: Dustin "DAB" Bowie & (Tasha Catour)]
(All I need is you)
By my side, thick and thin
Highs and lows, don't let go (all I need is)
We gon' ride, we gon' win
Don't know how, all I know
(All I need is you)

[Bridge: Dustin "DAB" Bowie & Tasha Catour]
You, you're all I ever needed
You're all I ever needed
(All I need is)
You, you're all I ever needed
You're all I ever needed
(All I need is you)

[Verse 3: J. Paul & Tasha Catour]
Ain't nobody gone get in the way
Put that on my money in the bank
Cause you do what them others can’t (all I need is you, you)
And I love that, yeah (all I need is you)
We gone ride till the rims fall off
Above it all, we can never fall, yeah
Hold my hand, we can have it all
Hold my hand, we can have it all

[Hook: Dustin "DAB" Bowie & Tasha Catour]
(All I need is you)
By my side, thick and thin
Highs and lows, don't let go (all I need is)
We gon' ride, we gon' win
Don't know how, all I know
(All I need is you)

[Bridge: Dustin "DAB" Bowie & Tasha Catour]
You, you're all I ever needed
You're all I ever needed
(All I need is)
You, you're all I ever needed
You're all I ever needed
(All I need is you)

[Outro: J. Paul & Tasha Catour]
You always pick me up when I'm feeling down
You always make it better for me some how
All I need is you, cause all I need is you
All I need is you
All I need is
All I need is
All I need is you, you, you
All I need is you
