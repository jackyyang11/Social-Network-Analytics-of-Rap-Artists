[Intro: Yakki Divioshi]]
Public Service Announcement
It's been a lot of struggle goin' on the past three months
Lot of police brutality, I'm just tryna
Make a positive movement for the young G's
You know what I'm sayn', let me tell you

[Hook: Yakki DiviOshi]]
What is this world comin' to
What is this world comin' to
What is this world comin' to
What is this world comin' to
Don't shoot, Don't shoot, I got my hands up
Don't shoot, Don't shoot, I got my hands up
I'm just trying (to) make my way home
Officer, I am alone
Just let me reach for my phone
Before situations get wrong

[Verse 1: Yakki Divioshi]]
It's time for a new resurrection
God sent me here on a mission
A new bag of Skittles, a new Arizona
And Trayvon got killed of suspicion
I heard "in a couple of years, they thinking 'bout havin' a purge
Arrest Eric Garner for sellin' the cigarettes
Then he got choked on that curb
Y'all 'posed to protect and serve
Why y'all keep killin' my people
Tryna make us look so evil
Burned down the gas station, Burned down the liquor store
Only way it would be equal
Make'em feel pain through the music
????
You a'int the savory, AK can't stay with me
Cause they not hangin' they shootin'
Remember Renisha McBride, broke down in the wrong neighborhood
Was lookin' for help in that neighborhood
She knocked on the door, he looked through the peep hole
He judged her by race, and then off with her face
This can't be the land of the free
And the home of the brave
Malcolm and Martin probably turn(ing) in they grave

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Yakki Divioshi]]
They ask why I'm feelin' so down
We just bought a house with a loan
They wonder was the struggle really worth all this
Condolences go out to Ferguson
R.I.P to Mike Brown
They're tearing our city down
United we stand, divided we fall
We got to stand up for America
They throwin' tear gas, and let go (of) the dogs
It really don't feel like America
They treatin' my people like terrorist
I want to see what Obama been tellin'em
They better not let him go
How could they let him go
Government code tryna kill us
Four hundred years of that slavery
It feel like it finna' to come back around
We made it through segregation
I see that the hate crime is back in town
Our people want civilization
Until we get it, it a'int no backin' down
Look at my city, they feelings down
LAPD killed Ezell even though he was laying down

[Hook]
