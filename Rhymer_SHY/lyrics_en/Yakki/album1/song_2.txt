[Hook]
They got me ridin' round the city with a choppa' and a 10 on me
I got a young nigga who'll take the shit and switch the vin on it
I'll probably give him a 10 for it
I got a 10 with me
She got a 10 on her
And the only way i pop them Percs, if they got a lil' 10 on em'
That Rollie watch need dat more diamonds, so I spent a 10 on it
Put that water drip all on that coupe, and it cost me a 10 homie
Nothin' but 100's and 50's and 20's in my bank, no 10's homie
I ain't seen a 10 since 0 10'
I've got them Michael Jordan, Michael Jordan, Michael Jordan
Twenty three 10's on me

[Verse 1]
I take that Harpo and Ceily and mix it all together and call it color purple
Last bitch from factory, i'm sippin' actory
I'm leanin', i'm leanin, yeah actually
The kush and codeine got me actin' stiff
31, 62, backward flip
I got that Mufasa, Mufasa, all in my seats in the Bugatti
Just copped a new 'Rari
Interior safari, bumpin' that Jay-Z and blowin' on Blue Ivy
Diamonds on deep-freezer, yo' hoe a meat-eater
He got that cut on it, he tryna' Capri-ya
10,000 walk-through and that's just to meet people
10,000 Dubai and that's just to see people
10,000 kush bags and that's for the streets nigga
10 whole thousand on ya' head for the beef nigga
Give my shoota' half and he'll paint the streets with ya'

[Verse 2]
I'm on that Percocet 10, a whole fifth of Hen, it got me on 10
I just bought a Benz, it cost me a 10
'cause they switched the vins
Fucked her and her friend
A new F & N, now who want it?
'Cause i'm ridin' round the city with a choppa' on me
Got 10 times a 10 thats a 100 on me
AK-47 came with a beam and a 100 on it
If I give him a 10, I can give him a 10
My diamonds foreign, they callin' them immigrants
My plug is a migo, my bitch is Dominican
She like no other, no not no synonyms
Fuck for 10 minutes and waste all her energy
Throw up some racks and fuck up fecundity
Post up in a magic and throw up a 10 again
Might cop a jug and thumb through a 10 again
HHHOOOOOO!!!
