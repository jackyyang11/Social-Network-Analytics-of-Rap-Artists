[Intro]
To get a thousand miles from the earth
A rocket would need this much power
It would take far more than a human lifetime
But a space station might look something like this
To get a thousand miles from the earth
A rocket would need this much power
This much power, this much power
This much power, this much power

[Verse 1: Ragga Twins]
When dem see we come dem open door den we enter
Bust up de place people ah let off rockers
Becar you know dem ya yout ah no friers
Tactically place de energy and de power
Dem mussy check say we a friend deh mussy check say we a spar
Come up nah me face know you ready fe de war
Put bullet pon a punk cah dem acting bizarre
Mad like a lion, now a time fe we roar

[Bridge]
To get a thousand miles from the earth
A rocket would need this much power
This much power
This much power
This much power

[Interlude: Ragga Twins]
Tactically place de energy and de power
Tactically place de energy and de power

[Chorus: Ragga Twins]
Bad boy lyricist, big entertainer
Come inna de place man you know we ah retainer
All ah de crew better jump up say bout ya
Some ah dem a scream and some ah dem a holla
Now we get hot a long time, we get warm
We bad badder bad bad biddy biddy bad bad from we born
When Ragga Twins come dem have fe ring de alarm
Well this one coming like a desert storm

[Interlude: Ragga Twins]
Tactically place

[Chorus]
