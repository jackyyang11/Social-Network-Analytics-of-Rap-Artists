Baby when you leave
I hold nothing back
Weapons up my sleeve
Like Im under attack
So cover up your ears
Cause it only fuels the fire
Ill be what you fear
Im the answer of your desire

[Chorus]
I touch the sky-y-y [x4]
(Your heart is)
[Skrillex]
If you could hear me now, why don't you recall?
I was the one who cared after all
I touch the sky
Let the light in my face
Pierce through my skin
Gone with the wind
I touch the sky
Let it fade into grey
Burst through the seams
Im on the wing

[Bridge]
I touch the sky [x4]

[Chorus]
I touch the sky-y-y [x4]
