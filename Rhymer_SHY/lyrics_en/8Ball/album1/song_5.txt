Common sense better tell you to grind and hustle
Hit the streets like a man, use your mind and muscle
We be all about the cream, living space age fantasies
Tryin to make my wallet green as a can of peas
We be them niggas, hoes brag they friends about
Tell them hoes how we beat that pussy inside out
I love it when you give me head in the benz
Up and down swallow it, we gettin in the wind
Never bashing women just them hoes to be given
Headshots and what not to people for livin
Who am I? Just another MC murderer
Judge sentencing, all hip hop purgerers
To death make a noose with the mic cord
Hangin niggas from his feet till the blood starts
Drippin from his nose suffocating them weak hoes
Nobody warned you not to fuck around with Primro
Suave affiliated nigga, we get much respect
From niggas we check and all the checks we collect
Let me tell you about this Suave House Fam shit
The only niggas with that 4 1/2 gram shit
Give me the money and the hoes and the good weed
And the mic so I can practice killing MCs
Dark dreams still come back in full colour
Fire and thick smoke, chokin motherfuckers
Hard pounded, the whizzle of the wind soundin
Like a woman screamin in a pool drownin
Am I insane from the frames givin to my brain
Eyes photographin all my people and their pain
Weak motherfuckers loosin and twist the game
See some bullshit and blow out their own brain
Hospitilized arm full of iv'z
Motherfuckers criticize and deny me
But who is the mad one? (who is the mad one)
Who is truely insane? (who is truely insane)
But who is the mad one? (who is the mad one)
Who is truely insane? (who is truely insane)
It's all on me, It's all on me
It's all on me, It's all on me
