[Intro : DJ Scream]
The year, the year was 1993
A young ain't have too much
Just a Coming Out Hard C.D., and a vision
A vision to take over the motherfucking streets
The nickel and dime was cool, but then a nigga had a bigger vision
A vision to stand up for street music
A vision to pledge allegiance to southern hip hop
Aye yo Ball I think you feel me nigga
Scream

[Verse 1: 8-Ball]
Yeah, charming south nigga, fat boy, Premro
Walk into the club, like you seeing it in slow-mo
Thick bad bitches, that's the bulk of my entourage
8-B, 8-LL, coming out hard
Same nigga, more mature, I'm classy
You can't see it, bitch put on your glasses
Hustle belly in a Chevy, hood icon
Forty five, extra clips, I might gat' one
Lame nigga looking stupid, I am not one
Green choke you when you hit it, I got some
Orange Mile, Memphis 10, where a nigga from
Where a nigga from, where a nigga from
I got a bigger vision then just rhyming all my life
Even though I love it, so I wanna rhyme all my life
Hitters was interrupted by ? streets
And I got front row seats, my skin feel the heat, shit
Hide it all the time, razor blade lines
God sit at a sewing machine and tailor made mine
I'm a plain gold Rolex, value is never lost
I'm a Big Mac with extra lettuce and extra sauce
Cross generations like Columbus crossed seas
Most popular down south, everybody know me
Top it off with my legendary rap ability
It means nothing when you don't show it financially
And I know, I know
That's why a nigga keep hustling
Yeah, cause I got a bigger vision

[Outro: DJ Scream]
Any many, many dollar bills later
Many, many bad bitches later
The legend 8-Ball still stand here before you
Premro 2 nigga
Real southern music for the fucking streets, nigga
