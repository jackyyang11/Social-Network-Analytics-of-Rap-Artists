Ahyeah, get down, do what they wanna do
Get down, from the back

[8ball]
I was born in poverty, nigga runnin with them killas
Hard liquor drinkin niggas, prostitutes, and drug dealers
Real hoes, money makin pay the bills
Hoes suck a dick and even strap on dildos
Powder bag blowin, syrup sippin, stick dippin
On my knees shootin dice in my mama kitchen
Shinin silver pack seem to sell quicker than crack
Niggas get down on that brown and don't know how to act
The devil got him now and only God can bring him back
Evil spirits and empty pockets make a nigga react
What make a nigga take a life before thinkin about it?
Anger management, controllin it, and reroute it
Cinderella and that doj' got my mind cloudy
Come at 5 spray the uzi when the club crowded
Out of the roof of the coupe straight to the loot
Fuck a hoot, nigga slab ridahs want proof

[Hook]
Ah yeah we gettin crunk tonight
Get down and some niggas wanna funk tonight
Ah yeah we gon lay it down tonight
Get down and make some niggas clown tonight
Ah yeah we gon get buck tonight
Get down, these ho's they wanna fuck tonight
Ah yeah we gon lay it down tonight
Get down and make some ho's clown tonight

Give me a reason niggas murder and massacre for the cheese
Worthless bitches and cocoa leaves by the keys
Under siege feds lookin for powder traces and loot
Got chipped by a bird that used to fly in my coop
Still tennin with them twinkies and I keep my 4-5th hidden
Life taker for for them playa fakers sniffin and trippin
Real is more than just a phrase niggas use in vein
People die and mothers everywhere felt the pain
Hard to explain how her baby head got blowed off
Parked in a red zone and got his life towed off
You can label me the under boss
This is the only way I know to get my point across
