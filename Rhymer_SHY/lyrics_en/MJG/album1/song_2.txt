We do it big time
We do it big time
We do it big time
We do it big time
I was tired of feelin so low
And i dont wanna feel that way again no more
Hit the corner in my 69 four door
Creepin on the low low
Now its so pro
Thats when i saw her in the front yard
It was on a friday
Right before it got dark we jumped on the highway
Then we did it my way
She gave me her myspace
Rep'd like she was my babe
Took her back to my place
Crack the sunroof
Let down your window
Let your hair blow
Listen to the radio
The the radio
The the radio
The the radio
The the radio
We be all good
We be all good
We be all good
We be all good
We do it big time
We do it big time
We do it big time
We do it big time
We all good all hood
All leather all wood
Kick back big time
Doin it like we know we should
You and me sunny day
Cadillac top back
Ride past your friend
Girls make them drive it top back
M tight, m j
Put that on a tattoo
Excuse me miss but i just can't stop lookin at you
Soft like a piece of cotton smooth like a smoothie
Im ten doors down but babygirl you move me
To the left to the right
Then up then down
I be makin sounds when you stir it up around and round
I can be your daddy
You be my lil mama
Lets go get a ticket to get get in the bahamas
