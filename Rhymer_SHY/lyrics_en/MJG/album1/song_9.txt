I can't get caught with the dirt that's in the air
The bitches in my hair
Or those niggas over there
I sware commnication skills being best
So I don't wear no armor on my chest
God bless my soul
Having to get a 100 yrs. old
Stable mind fool body control good as gold
Sippin' Hen'
Yeah I'm sippin' Hen' what you thought
That shit will get sold that sh!t wiill get bought
I thought
That real niggas understood the hustle
But yet you wanta get paid
Out and in between the struggle
My mother
My friend to the got damn end
Cause sometime your kin
Will do your ass in
My friend my foe my woman my ho
If the shoe fit yo toe
Just as long as you know who you be
Look here cause I know who I be
I be the coolest ass nigga bout as far as
You can see MJG
Guaranteed out rump spanker
Cognac dranker deep thought thanker
Painter picture for your ears as you listen
It's bout time for you to peep
What you been you goota

Keep your mind be strong
You can't be to impatient
The government is hatin
Them sticker boards is waitn by your ride
You tired of the way that life is treating you
Your personal life is f*cked up
Your baby momma beeping you
(2x)

I got hang up let downs bad breaks set backs
Chart took my check back
Hopin I'm a sweat that
Less that
Other finacial helps come through
I'm a countinue doin' what I do stand true
Within my heart I had it plan from the start
Playin the cart just only trying to do my part
All I can say is that the LORD must of bless me
Cause comin up
I know that the streets did test me
From 16 yrs. old we flowed
And blewed joes with
Niggas who were cold
But old and know Moses
I had to make my own path through my math
Understand that I had to be sad before
I'm glad
See life play tricks on your mind
You got to fight it
Or else you just a bumb waitng to get egnighted
I write it
But also I live it and I'm a get it
Straight to the ass and make sure my people
Feel it

Chorus

Who said making money easy
Sho nuff if it's illegal
I'm trying to roll a got damn Benz
Up out this regal
The season keep passing my
Stuck in the cold
No transportation to role
My clothes is old
The devil is trying to make me believe
That I need
What the next man got in order for me to achieve yes indeed
Close your grip or else fall
Cause the only one catching you ass
Gone be the walls
See time never waits for one who sits still
But some take they hole damn life to get real
I chill
Do my own damn thing
Fuck a buster
A ho can only get on my nerves if I trust her
Now could I get pay for flattery hell naw
Consider when you stuck me but really I stuck
Yall applause give me some dap I bust raps
But you not intouch with yourself you gone snap

Chorus till he starts talkin
