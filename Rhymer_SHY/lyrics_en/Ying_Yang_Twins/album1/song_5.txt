All good things may come to an end
All bad things can't wait to begin
All good things may come to an end
All bad things can't wait to begin

What shall make you laugh, it shall make you cry
What can't leave the ground shall not greet the sky
What shall make you laugh, it shall make you cry
What can't leave the ground shall not greet the sky
