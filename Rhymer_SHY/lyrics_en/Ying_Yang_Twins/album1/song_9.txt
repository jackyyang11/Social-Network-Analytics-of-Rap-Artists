[Chorus: Kaine]
G's smoke weed and flip them birds
Rollin' ain't a [?] all on the curb
Head to the club for the weekend thing
Hopin' to find a broad that'll give us some brain

[Verse 1: D-Roc]
Slide to the side, to the pimps, to the hustlers
In the room full of busters
Sittin' all off in the place, she be actin' like the mac
Breakin' off from the suckers
Tell me what's up, do you wanna vibe or ride?
We just small the ball, we got a freak number
Will I call her? I don't know
Act a hoe, gettin' smoke, so I gotta hit the liquor store
And my folks, what you hittin' for?
Do you got somethin' on this endo?
You say you doin' better, but I'm one of the best
With the East on my chest, just stayin' possessed
Smoke that, choke that, that's what I say
Still the [?] on my eye 'cause they kinda red
Seen the popos actin' like, sittin' tight, man
See I swerve to the curb
Smokin' on that herb
Sippin' that gin, feelin' tipsy
Hopin' that it don't get me
'Cause I know I'll leave you high
And I ain't gon' lie, brother, I stay high
I'm with my [?]
With my folks, tryna leave me
They can't see me 'cause I'm a G and we can't be
Reunited like that
Laid back with my style
[?] wild and a broad at the hotel
Sippin' [?] then I broke off, doggy style
You wanna ball like me but I think you gotta wait a while
Now watch me contend you
To your neighborhood venue
Has it got in? Has it got in?
Now tell me what them G's do

[Chorus: Kaine]
G's smoke weed and flip them birds
Rollin' ain't a [?] all on the curb
Head to the club for the weekend thing
Hopin' to find a broad that'll give us some brain
G's smoke weed and flip them birds
Rollin' ain't a [?] all on the curb
Head to the club for the weekend thing
Hopin' to find a broad that'll give us some brain

[Verse 2: D-Roc]
[?] nigga side, flip through the script
Better holla at me 'cause you know me
This Inglewood thug from the west side
Where all them niggas and hoes be
It's go, G, but you can call me D-Roc
Big ballin' like it's lethal
With the weed and the drank and a fresh pack of pokes
You can reach me on my beeper
Flip first on the curse, I'm a ballin' G
These bitches wanna ride with me
But these hoes can't ride for free
That's the way it's just gotta be
Forget the fleas and the enemies
It's Friday, so I'm headin' to the club for the weekend thang
Gotta find some brain
So I'm makin' moves, gotta keep my cool
Never slippin' on the pimpin', that's a major rule
Where my thugs at? Where my thug hoes?
On the dancefloor throwin' them [?] and Os
If you step your toes, [?]
That's just the way this thang go so
Playa ride with me, are you gettin' in?
Nigga comin' out with that thug shit
It's the comin' of that nigga clique
When the thug hit, she better move, bitch
So you never do your thang for the come up, this
We been up in this ballin' shit
So Boulevard, Inglewood
Westside to [?], we ball
Comin' up out the, comin' up out the wood, where we flossin'
What them Gs do? What them Gs, huh?

[Chorus: Kaine]
G's smoke weed and flip them birds
Rollin' ain't a [?] all on the curb
Head to the club for the weekend thing
Hopin' to find a broad that'll give us some brain
G's smoke weed and flip them birds
Rollin' ain't a [?] all on the curb
Head to the club for the weekend thing
Hopin' to find a broad that'll give us some brain

[Verse 3: D-Roc]
Sittin' off in the club with a boss on me
The full bags of the weed is a must to me
So I smoke 'em up, throwin' pokes in the G ride
Where the hobos come up
Sippin' on [?], Hennessy
If you ain't no friend to me
Then you must be my enemy
But I gotta keep a remedy
'Cause I know all them folks kinda hate me
Thinkin' lately, seen a girl ain't takin' it
Standin' all that at the bus stop
She thinkin' I must stop, be the one to drop
Kinda young, nigga throw her a lollipop
Now watch me bounce to the hemp
But ain't got no dank so I head for the ghetto
Love bein' on when they come to get the fat duffle sack
Black comin' straight from the meadow
Tryna lay the flow with the ballin' Gs
Never worried 'bout the fallen leaves
Just follow these
Lil G and taller G
Now come on, playa, can you ball with me?
I know you wanna smoke some
Just let a nigga know some
We can do this [?]
Go stimulate your brain
Mary Jane keep you sane and maintain
And if it rain, I do the same thing
That never change

[Chorus: Kaine]
G's smoke weed and flip them birds
Rollin' ain't a [?] all on the curb
Head to the club for the weekend thing
Hopin' to find a broad that'll give us some brain
G's smoke weed and flip them birds
Rollin' ain't a [?] all on the curb
Head to the club for the weekend thing
Hopin' to find a broad that'll give us some brain
