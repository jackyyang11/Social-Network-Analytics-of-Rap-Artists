[Verse 1: G-Mo Skee]
I'm stoned like an Arab chick with no clothes on
Dro so strong that I'm fucking up the ozone
My shit packs a punch, we be matching blunts
Then put the roaches in the bowl like Cap'n Crunch
These bitches looking for a smoke out, never
I make a Siamese twin throw down extra
If she only has five bucks for the session
The other head is getting neglected
I'm nothing to mess with, when I'm drunk
But I don't go to bars man
I'm hitting trees like I'm fucking drunk Tarzan
Raised by the apes,taking eights to the face
Beat a dog with a sledgehammer, Triple H
And I'm fucking your bitch, the kid saw the sillouhette
Now I'm on the couch in a Snuggie with a Pillow Pet
The Mad Hatter is back, matter of fact
He's in your house and he's smoking a sack
(I'm gettin' high!!)

[Hook]
The whole world is looking at me now
(Whatchu looking at bitch?)
I'm getting so high
(I'm getin high)
Yes he's getting higher
(Yes, yes nigga)
The whole world is looking at me now
(Whatchu looking at bitch?)
I'm getting so high
(I'm getin high)
Yes he's getting higher

[Verse 2:Kevin MacLane]
Catch me at the race, I was high at the derby
Puffed up, riding on a cloud like Kirby
And this 69 cent Swischer's dead man working
Me to puff that OG Kush and now you dragging if I'm perkin
That shit'll have you crying dawg I'm loaded
Two a.m. smoking at the studio tokin'
This shit right here will have you move in slow motion
Lohan, that shit'll put a nigga in a coma
That shit last night that I was crumblin'
Sittin to the moon had a nigga straight mumblin'
Rumblin', rummaging rum run through the mothership
For some other shit, no rumbling, no stumbling
Now I'm in the building and I'm feeling it
So don't come through with that nigga Buzz Killington
I'm posted in a smoke circle cuts and I'm faded
So don't bring yo niggas if yo niggas ain't faded
