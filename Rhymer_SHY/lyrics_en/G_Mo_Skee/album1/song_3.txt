[Intro]
And so it was written, young G-mo set off on his quest to become a real boy. Ya'know-what-I-mean?

[Verse 1]
It all started in Hilltop my momma got a call, from the drug program  that she was involved
Suddenly she got mad and tossed her phone, then a van showed up and took us all to foster homes
CPS stepped in and kept us for a couple weeks, I went to school and they treated me like a fucking freak
When momma got us back who woulda known the plot would thicken, we got evicted packed our shit up and headed off to Richmond
That's where my quest began, at my grandpa's crib they smoked so much crank I caught second hand
I use to get jumped one time I got decked and ran, I saw the D boy stomping out a naked man
House hold ?2-1? fiends left the food gone, the bathroom was filthy I showered with my shoes on
I said to myself no matter where my destiny might fall, I will never fucking be like ya'll
Dirt poor on the floor with the spots of bacteria, no bed just a cot made of cotton material
On a steady diet of top ramen and cereal but when Summer time came schools brought us a miracle
Because we got the free lunches, the shit was fucking scrumptious it felt good to have something different in our stomachs
Eleven years old I was twisted and corrupted, With no respect for my elders or the general public

[Hook]
Let's take them back
Let's turn the page back
Back before a nigga became of age back when I was writing filthy sixth grade raps (And so it was written)
Young G-Mo set off on his quest so he can put his fucking balls to the test (Now listen to me ya'll)
I'm talking way back, back before rappers became J Cats and started driving them gay ass Maybachs
Young G-Mo set off on his quest so he can put his fucking balls to the test (And that's some real shit)

[Verse 2]
I've been through the fire, I was a stupid minor, ran the streets with my fam went to school with ?rider/writers?
The [insert school name I can't make out] middle had me feeling like a true survivor, a kid showed up strapped to kill a supervisor
A week prior my Cuz came home from Richmond high, with cuts on her face, both arms, tits, and thighs
They carved gang signs on her flesh with kitchen knives, banged on her and told her she could snitch and die
I couldn't tell you what any of that feels like, I was a pipsqueak I would smoke weed and steal bikes
But all I ever wanted to do was kill mics, back when I was twelve I had my first real fight
This kid Doodie try to play me soft, popping shit and I never like the way he talked
So I told that nigga to meet me behind Cesar Chavez, I gave his ass the Wombo Combo and he dropped dead

[Hook]
Let's take them back
Everything you know, erase that let me start from scratch, paint a picture of my life and display that (And so it was written)
Young G-Mo set off on his quest so he can put his fucking balls to the test (Now listen to me ya'll)
I'm talking way back, before I had the beanie and the wave cap, licked the ball sack, before I made that (And so it was written)
Young G-Mo set off on his quest so he can put his fucking balls to the test (And that's some real shit)

[Verse 3]
Yeah, so that's how G-Mo Skee was made, all the violence, the filthy dope fiends and pain
Came from the gutter, government cheese and grains, now I'm spitting it until my whole team is paid
This ain't a sob story, this is guts and glory, fuck the higher ups y'all ain't got nothing for me
I'm just a young nigga trying to get a meal ticket, but these suit and ties keep hatin' like some real bitches
Speaking of which, if you think you can just stand in my way and stop me from feeding my nieces and shit
You might as well jump 100 feet from a cliff, because you don't want beef when my peeps in the Rich, NIGGA
