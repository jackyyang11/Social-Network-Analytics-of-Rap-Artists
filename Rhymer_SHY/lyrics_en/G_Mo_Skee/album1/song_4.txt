[Chorus: Vinne Paz]
Bitch passenger head blowing in the wind
Never take an L, all we do is win
You niggas novice amateurs or beginners
Only fuck with my people I know from the beginning
Still catch a fade 'til I see better days
Still catch a fade 'til I see better days
Still catch a fade 'til I see better days
Still catch a fade
Better days

[Verse 1: Inf Gang]
Life gave me beef stew I made lemonade
Crushed the shit out of them 'til I got my investment straight
I dare 'em to test my strength
They got a better chance of running from Leatherface in everglades
Still I keep my faith up for them better days
And like I'm throwing haircuts out, you can catch a fade
My team got an artillery bus with 'chete blades
Think we were raised in church camp how we set them straight
Only rock with the ones that's from the get go
You fakes related to snakes like they [?]
Big dick riders and cheaters like Joey Greco
I got a higher standard than a lot of you left hoe
Bitch and a pastor, half black and Japanese
Wind blowing at her, she had to catch her weave
Still going hard, 6 in the morning
Brighter days in front of me man picture me rolling

[Chorus: Vinnie Paz]
Bitch passenger head blowing in the wind
Never take an L, all we do is win
You niggas novice amateurs or beginners
Only fuck with my people I know from the beginning
Still catch a fade 'til I see better days
Still catch a fade 'til I see better days
Still catch a fade 'til I see better days
Still catch a fade
Better days

[Verse 2: Inf Gang]
I'm still waiting to see better days
Still contemplating to catch a case and send 'em niggas running straight
Compact 4, 5 that's a section 8
Waiting on your next move'll be your next mistake
Aiming with the 2 trying not to miss your face
Thinking I'm a fool bullets pyune as they ricochet
"Inf Gang"
Inf Gang nigga what you finna say?
When we done talking then we tell them that we on the way
12 gun strap once park the car
Up close and personal we shooting at you from afar
This that day to day hustling trying to make a living
We can knuckle up and throw the fists and try to get with them
And once we beat your ass, have nothing to say
'Cause we didn't all have better days
And once we beat your ass, have nothing to say
'Cause we didn't all have better days

[Chorus: Vinnie Paz]
Bitch passenger head blowing in the wind
Never take an L, all we do is win
You niggas [?] amateurs or beginners
Only fuck with my people I know from the beginning
Still catch a fade 'til I see better days
Still catch a fade 'til I see better days
Still catch a fade 'til I see better days
Still catch a fade
Better days

[Bridge: Inf Gang]
They don't wanna catch my fade
They don't wanna catch my fade

[Verse 3: G-Mo Skee]
Who these niggas speaking on me from a safe location?
Who them niggas bold enough to try to take on Jason
Boy I ain't famous enough to not beat your ass
And all my niggas ride like a fucking Six Flags season pass
I torture niggas if they play my clique
But I stopped eating humans 'cause they taste like shit!
My momma told there'd be days like this
But she ain't tell me I'd be digging fucking graves like this
Run when you see the gigantic G-Mo-Saurus Rex
Taking a prehistoric shit on every hood, yours is next
You can't avoid your death
And if you try I'll come by the hospital disconnect the life support and jet
They all hate me and they want me to lose
I walk in the room
It's like throwing salt in the wound
Nigga get off what you mad at?
Bitch I'm mad at everything
No peace
No sleep
'Til I see better days

[Chorus: Vinnie Paz]
Bitch passenger head blowing in the wind
Never take an L, all we do is win
You niggas novice amateurs or beginners
Only fuck with my people I know from the beginning
Still catch a fade 'til I see better days
Still catch a fade 'til I see better days
Still catch a fade 'til I see better days
Still catch a fade
Better days

[Outro: Vinnie Paz (Inf Gang)]
Bitch passenger head blowing in the wind
(They don't wanna catch my fade)
You niggas novice amateurs or beginners
(They don't wanna catch my fade)
Still catch a fade 'til I see better days
(They don't wanna catch my fade)
Still catch a fade 'til I see better days
(They don't wanna catch my fade)
Better days
