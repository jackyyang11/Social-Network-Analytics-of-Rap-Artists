[Intro]
Yeah, hey yo it's G-Mo Skee. And when you see me riding through your motherfucking hood on a squeaky bike you better tuck your fucking shit nigga. Hahaha. Fuck you niggas. Fuck being humble nigga I'm already dead. I'm already dead!
Filth

[Chorus]
You can crush my heart with a sledge
You can take me to a cliff and throw me off of a ledge
You can lock me in a cage, try to starve me instead
It doesn't matter what you do bitch I'm already dead!
You can shoot me with a fucking Glock in the head
You can force feed me a bottle of pharmacy meds
You can chop me up, take a fucking arm and a leg
But the jokes' on you bitch I'm already dead!

[Verse 1]
This is anti-humanity slash killer music
I wash my ass in a bathtub filled with sewerage
You wanna kill me? Have holy water and silver bullets
Nail me to a cross in the middle of a field and do it (just do it)
Niggas get sacrificed with they feet tied
I add 'em to the pool of blood, now that shit is knee-high
If you look in the mirror, say my name three times
I'll show up and wreck shop like a wasp in a beehive
All you faggot rappers finna make me lock the closet
Found a conscious rapper at my show, now I've got a hostage
Take me to your fucking leader bitch: I slaughter bosses
I was taught to never let 'em run like the water faucet
Died in '95 from a freak accident
They threw me in the morgue but my body has been absent since
Now I'm a zombie, running the streets, clapping shit
Cops sending shots at a nigga but I haven't flinched

[Chorus]
You can crush my heart with a sledge
You can take me to a cliff and throw me off of a ledge
You can lock me in a cage, try to starve me instead
It doesn't matter what you do bitch I'm already dead!
You can shoot me with a fucking Glock in the head
You can force feed me a bottle of pharmacy meds
You can chop me up, take a fucking arm and a leg
But the jokes' on you bitch I'm already dead!

[Verse 2]
Worms and maggots in my hat I feel them squirm together
I used two pitchforks to eat a German Shepherd
Dipped the machete in oil, now it's working better
Sever heads and burn the bodies in the fucking church's cellar
Boy you never heard such a bloodthirsty rap
Fuck with me I'll murder your cul-de-sac with a sturdy axe
Throw a brick through the back window of your dirty Lac
Like the bitch who called Ms. Parker fucking Bernie Mack (white devil)
You niggas spit like you never had a fight before
My niggas spit like cavemen that wrestle dinosaurs
When this shit's jumping off like a diving board
You're getting stomped out with more kicks than the Nike store
X-Rated flow; this is not a rap for kids
This is where I grab the can of whoop-ass and crack the lid
Chop 'em up, fuck his body up and pack the fridge
Then come to the Inf Gang barbecue with a rack of ribs

[Chorus]
You can crush my heart with a sledge
You can take me to a cliff and throw me off of a ledge
You can lock me in a cage, try to starve me instead
It doesn't matter what you do bitch I'm already dead!
You can shoot me with a fucking Glock in the head
You can force feed me a bottle of pharmacy meds
You can chop me up, take a fucking arm and a leg
But the jokes' on you bitch I'm already dead!

[Verse 3]
I ain't bodybuilding at the gym, I don't play games
I want to lift a shawty, that's the reason I weight train
Busting off it's like you niggas got hit with a freight train
Put the barrel on your chest like a fucking [?] chain
No I don't see a threat, I just see a bunch of busters
I'm finna hit you uncle-fuckers with the knuckle dusters
Aim a rocket launcher at your whip [?] clustered
Everywhere I go I'm leaving motherfuckers smothered
No peace, I'm not an apologetic dude
I'm liable to still explode even if you lick the fuse
Run up on 'em pussies and I let the weapon ooze
They freeze up like Sub-Zero did his special move
'Cause they don't want to meet Jason
Inf Gang fucked your bitch then we dropped her off at the police station
Walking with a waddle
'Cause I fucked her with a broken alcohol bottle
Full throttle
Bitch said she didn't swallow
