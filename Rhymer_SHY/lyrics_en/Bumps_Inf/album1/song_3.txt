[Verse 1]
Here we are seven years later, this is the day that you would save me
You've been using circumstances and things that have been to shape me
Reggie got murdered outside his home, 7 A.M. picked up that phone
[?] on the line, he crying saying Reggie's gone
Andrea had killed herself
Right after she left my crib, they say that she used a belt
This is pain I've never felt, these things were preparing me
For your love and [?] the day the Gospel truth was shared with me
Oh no here we go again, using pain [?] me
'Cause the mother of my children bounced and left me by my lonely
Raising three children all by myself can cause some difficulties
You were [?] on the mixtape bro, here homie hear the hope beat
Here's the whole thing
I'm 'finna go in (I'm 'finna go in)
Let me do it (Let me do it)
Right hand on the Bible (Right hand on the Bible)
This my choice (Let's go)
[?] like I've been through hell and back
But I've learned to [?]
Here's my pain in paragraphs

[Outro]
Yeah!
It's Bumps!
God Over Money!
It's yo turn!
Let's go!
