[Verse 1: Bumps INF]
Who would have known?
Big Mike you would OD
Here we are two weeks later
Burying your mom for the same thing
Dang, pills are just stacking
Funeral costs but I feel this reaction
I go and just get it by any means
Especially when I think I go good
When it's lacking
What it would look like
If I started making this money illegally?
Yeah I would profit
But I would be just disregarding
What Jesus thinks
Plus I don't like my chances
Got fam' and a sister
So I stand in the [?]
And I pray that the holy big man would forgive them
In the land where we're given a plan
But no one to understand it
[?] It has to be risen
Hold fast to his wisdom
And the facts that he's written
Instead of dwelling forever
On the hand that's been given
[?] Wake up
And put God over revenue
Because the day you go and do that
Guaranteed that you never lose

[Chorus: Norman Michael]
What would it profit a man
To gain the world, and lose his soul?
All the money and the fame
You can't take that, when you go
That's why I give him all I got
Give him, give him all I got
Give him all I got
Give him, give him all I got
That's why I give him all I got
Give him, give him all I got
Give him all I got
Give him, give him all I got

[Verse 2: Marty Mar of Social Club]
Okay, I been trillin'
That's true life
I've been an outcast
Since my pastor decided
To move on, and get a new wife
Talk crazy when I do right
[?] Until my moves right
And I turn my dreams into true life
And that's true life
Voted most likely to do life
I had hand me downs that we're too tight
And too many kids didn't like me
So I had to switch schools
Over on a new side
I never heard about Jesus Crucified
So I wasn't accepted in a private school
Back in Junior High
[?] Just a new disguise
I'll be the coolest guy
A call from my doctor
He told me if I keep working hard
I'mma die young
Just another [?]
And truthfully at least I know
What I'mma die from
99 problems, but honestly
I feel like I only got one
And everybody's talking, talking, talking
Nobody understands where I'm from
And what means the world to me
Is that the money, clothes, and the fast cars
Shopping sprees at the mall
You can put it all directly on a black card
But when you die
You can't take it with you
Over to the other side
You can't spend it all on another ride
So is it really worth it
To live this life?

[Chorus: Norman Michael]
What would it profit a man
To gain the world, and lose his soul?
All the money and the fame
You can't take that, when you go
That's why I give him all I got
Give him, give him all I got
Give him all I got
Give him, give him all I got
That's why I give him all I got
Give him, give him all I got
Give him all I got
Give him, give him all I got

[Verse 3: F.E.R.N of Social Club]
[?] Since 2015, be home 5 years
From a 10 year ordeal
Every time I watch first 48
99 percent of [?]
At the first chance all squeal
You are looking at a man with a fam'
Now I gotta [?]
He gonna stand out
Say his name on a rap
Let him know that his dad show love
Even when he put the tracks down
Here's my pleasure, and my pain
And my struggles
On the streets
I would get it from the muscle
Now I tell them that God is the truth
And the parents [?]
Cause I keep them out of trouble
Yeah, I used to sniff coke and pop pills
Now my only formula is Enfamil
[?] While posts on Facebook
Are gonna get you killed
Little [?] on the block still
No matter how much I gospel rap
So I just keep it trill until [?]
I pray that the Lord take them out of that
I never knew this could happen to me
Satisfaction with telling them
That the Lord saves
Now the rappers [?] please stop [?]
I just listen to what the Lord says
Got the streets on fire baby
From the bottom to the top
Make the folks hit the fire escape
This flow it cannot be [?]
Don't you [?]
God over money today
So this is what I recommend
If you're trying to take the time to listen up
Then [?]
Don't be trying to stack no treasure
When you know in the end
You cannot even keep it

[Chorus: Norman Michael]
What would it profit a man
To gain the world, and lose his soul?
All the money and the fame
You can't take that, when you go
That's why I give him all I got
Give him, give him all I got
Give him all I got
Give him, give him all I got
That's why I give him all I got
Give him, give him all I got
Give him all I got
Give him, give him all I got
That's why I
