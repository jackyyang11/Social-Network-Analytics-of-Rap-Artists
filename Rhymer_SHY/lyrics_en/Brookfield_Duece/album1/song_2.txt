Count it count it count it count it (Bitch Count it!)

Went to sleep a hustler, I woke up in a fountain (get money)

Everything wet, Duece bout a check

Make moves rent due aye (aye), Hustle since school aye (aye)

Verse 2:
(Duece)

[Wet!]
First of the month, You talking money Imma holler
Imma scholar bout my dollas Ask ya baby father
About a boy with the drama from the 9 I feel like igudola
All I want is commas commas commas
Play with my squad you get them problems
And we all smart we fasho solve em
Quadratics, started in the basement now I'm in the attic

Bridge:
(Duece)
You know I never had nothing, First thing I'm thinking is stunting
Pull up on chickens I'm bumping, In DMs wassup girl quit frontin’
Hustle and the hunger had to sandwich it
Lemme cook now don't try and damage it
These people counterfeit, I know they doubted this
Tapping on my wrist like Dame, You know what time it is
