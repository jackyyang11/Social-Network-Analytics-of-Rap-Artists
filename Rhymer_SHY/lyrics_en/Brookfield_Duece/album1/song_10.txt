I’m tryna get the money 10 ways
You talking 10 years and I’m talking 10 days
All my homies get paid (pay up, pay up, pay up)
All my homies get paid (pay up, pay up, pay up)
I’m tryna get the money 10 ways
You talking 10 years and I’m talking 10 days
All my homies get paid (pay up, pay up, pay up)
All my homies get paid (pay up, pay up, pay up)

Verse 1:
(Like)
I’m tryna get the money 10 ways
You talking 10 years and I’m talking 10 days
I need it paid in full right before I hit the stage
Make sure the check is clear I ain’t tryna play no games
These rappers fugazi I ain’t bout to say no names
But look up in your rear view I’m driving in your lanes
Nigga I don’t hear you, what is it you’re saying?
You not talking money we don’t speak the same language
Still breaking bread with the homies that I came with
You still getting robbed by them people that you hang with
My nigga you owe me money homie why you playing?
It’s been a couple years, you ain’t hit me, I’m just saying

Verse 2:
(Duece)
I'm trying to get the money 10 ways
You talking 10 years
And I'm talking 10 days
10 niggas on the corner
Then you seeing 10 slaves
10 niggas tend to tend to the things that get em sprayed
We never seem to see all the things that get us swayed
Away from our goals when a tech is in the way
We all get blinded by the jewels and the baes
So we choose to hit the bottle hit the haze getting dazed
But everybody eats B....
We gon get it out the street B....
The homie shot Ace B....
Then ratted on the homie for the cheese B Is that how y'all do me?!?

Verse 3:
(Mani Draper)
Used to be a penny for your thoughts
Now the caption lives for free
Grab the tool, double tap, what’s the math overseas
10 hours at 30,000 feet, that’s a whole other album if you leave it up to me
Unc thought us how to divvy pies
The sponsors gotta gimme mine
All the leverage and the product my nigga guess I’ll make it rhyme
I’d rather give you game over kick and snare
No feelings ever talking business into winner ears
The power circle stephon’ing around these urkels damn right I’m going commercial but with niggas that’ll hurt you
Principality, not dying broke. here is the strategy press and release the casualties monetizing reality
So keep that advance, I want all my points on the back end
Not gon be the one slaving here over his passion the world asking what happened?
