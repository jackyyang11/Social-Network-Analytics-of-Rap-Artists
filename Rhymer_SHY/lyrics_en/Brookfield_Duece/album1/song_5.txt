It's not right but it’s alright, yea

(Tish Hyman)

Keep it 100 I'm just trying to find a better way
And keep my head above these waters another day
To tell the truth everything we get they take away
Now the negus reinvent it and it's okay, okay
Black People, black power
Black excellence, black knowledge
Black is beautiful, keep smiling
They can’t take ya life keep shining (yea)

Verse 1:
(Duece)

Harold lemme get that number 2! (That look good)
You know exactly how we do!
Don't forget the extra hot sauce (put some more in there)
I need some more napkins
I'll take a side of Mac and cheese
You fucked up teaching us collard greens
The soul got us lost in the sauce
I guess we'll use yours
How Red say it?
It's like both ours we'll just keep at my house
And don't get upset and open your big mouth
Don't get upset and open your big mouth
(Too late)
But ooh are those gold teeth
You flashy assuming you think you royalty
Would that something that you’d consider street?
Oh, you just trying to eat

Verse 2:
(Duece)

I raged against the man
He told us Jesus ways
Told us to pay them tithes now it’s G's us pays....
Man I guess we just Jesus slaves
Cuz if we live they say I told you, Jesus saves
But why he white though?
Why its fast food chains at every light though?
Why the news paint us as psycho
Can’t get a job
Can't save
Don't know my fico
You know how it feel to speak your dreams
And your parents ain't hearing you?
Closed minded didn’t believe in miracles
I see how Jesus feel
Didn't wanna listen until you show a Mill
Damn I Guess they gotta see it build...
I Guess they gotta see the real...
Remember I didn't see a meal...
Another rapper on the team yea I see Amil...
Couldn't tell me the rock wouldn't see a mill
That was the only option
Hoop was dead but I was Hot Saucing
For the chicken found rap
Jumped out the coffin
Thank god for the hesi cross and
Thank god for the hesi cross
And snatch (yep)
That's what y'all did and now we want it back

Bridge:
(Dreebo)

I just want wings so I can fly away
I write a song you get a check make me feel a way
The homies use they legs trying to get away
Jump nigga jump what them people say
(They can't take no more, they can't take no more, They don't love the culture, they don't love the culture)
Them blue/green/jealous eyes want Thick thighs
But I just want wings so I can fly away
(So I can fly, so I can fly away)
Them blue/green/jealous eyes want Thick thighs
But I just want wings so I can fly away
(So I can fly away)

Outro:
(Ryan Watts)

In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies
But the silence of our friends
