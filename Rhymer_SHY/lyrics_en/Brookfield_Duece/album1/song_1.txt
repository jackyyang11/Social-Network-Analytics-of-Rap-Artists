Verse 1:
(Duece)
I wanted to be top tier
I stopped tears and went to work
Started from the bottom
Adidas shoes in the dirt
Holes in my sole
Holes in my soul
Holes in my shirt
Holy shit hallelujah thank Him for rebirth
Now it's window seats looking down on earth (looking down on earth)
Glad I found a woman who was down to earth (who was down to earth)
Had some ups and downs but for what it's worth (but for what it’s worth)
I wouldn't trade nothing being from my turf
I wouldn't trade nothing being from my turf
I wouldn't trade nothing being from my turf
I wouldn't trade nothing being from my turf
I wouldn't trade nothing...
Foreal
America
Land not for me home of the slaves
Charges Trumped up to keep us in a cage
Drugs and the guns keep us in the graves
America
America

Outro 1:
(Duece)
No refuge could save the hireling and slave
From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave
And the star spangled banner in triumph doth wave...
America

Verse 2:
(Duece)
Tiki torches and AK-47s
By his side like a best man
Thinking head shots don't need a vest man
I pray us humans really invest in
Us, but war what we investing
Sons and daughters die and mama is stressing
Granny told me to Count my blessings (She did)
You don't win or lose, You win or lessons
Save money in summer, Cause winter lessens
When the officer stop you just learn the lessons
...Or daddy gon have less sons
Strap up, army gear
They call it a peaceful protest dressed in fear
But a peaceful debate nobody trying to hear
They gon run over everybody that's hard to steer (control)
But when you see us as steer we easy to reel in (cattle)
The weapon ain't the gun it's the skin
I scream to the crowds, you don't know where I been!!!
But you know just that!
You exactly where and you could take me back!
Our relationship broken but you could take me back!
Instead you choose and try and take me back
To a time when you didn't have rights cause you was black (that’s fucked up)
You think standing up mean we don't know how to act
I look at the news and I don't get how we back
‘Cause we never left
The key to getting right Is starting with self
Starting with self
It’s starting with self
It’s starting with self
It’s starting with self
