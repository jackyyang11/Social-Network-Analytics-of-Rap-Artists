I call that wraith right there

Yes it is, God

Verse 1:
(Duece)
When I get older Get the gold chain
Get the carrots
Get the bad bitch Nigga gon be far from average
Status, check my status Every night a nigga glad it's
Not the casket my mind a basket
Ask if, I been saks fifth
Imma tell you yea, but that's a lie until I have it
Til I grab it (yea)
Walk up in the muthafucka tripping
Grab the jacket off the rack
Then run out and drop the sensor
Tell the guard that I'm sprinter
They don't pay enough to get a
Hood rat I'm master splinter
He gon turtle when I enter
Carry on with my agenda
Get the money no dilemma
Nigga colder then December
Fuck a hater trying to take a nigga life
Cuz I remember

I’m a field nigga, flatland where I chill nigga

Hook:
(Duece)
I woke up this morning knowing I’m a field nigga
Knowing I’m a field nigga
I went to sleep last night knowing I’m a field nigga
Knowing I’m a field nigga

Verse 1:
(Duece)
Look what it's costing us
On the news they offing us
Shot by the officers
Ain't much changed since rosa bus
The offering ain't enough
Hoping that god will come
Swoop down save a nigga save a nigga
Save a nigga
Everything in the church ain't from the lord
Drugs and alcohol only fill the void
For a minute the tension is hard to avoid
They think we ignorant, foolish plotters assuming
I know about it, be lucky I'm into rooming
Bored with just letting em live, I need a tomb
And if you break shit down you'll see what you're consuming
Propaganda gon have you needing some tissue
Help your boy meet the world to tell em that he ain't with you
That's so Shawn, I Ben a Savage, this easy
I want the stage and the tv, I got dope trying make Misters Feeny

Verse 2:
(Duece)
The world Pimp like Rosebudd
High school wanted to be a Bone Thug
But I never seen harmony
Trying to avoid these niggas harming me
For breakfast ate the hominy
I Put on the hand washed laundry
Walk to the economy (to the money)
I Shoulda ran
Kap got on one knee just to take a stand
Hella fans don't come unless I get a Stan
Lotta people ain't what they preach when they take the stand
You over the top with the lies I don't understand
They want us all to bust guns and push grams
Grams said “I’m a push til you become a man
After that it's on you”
I Touchdown in the hood and shit it’s all new
I heard we all crabs on the corner it's all true
Between all the haters and boys in all blue
They gon make a nigga snap on the field on two (hut hut)

Outro:
(Duece)
Look up in the hills nigga
You don’t know how I feel nigga
Pain is real nigga pain is real
Pain is real nigga
I’m a field nigga, I’m a field nigga
I got dreams of the hills nigga
Look up in the hills nigga
They don’t know how I feel nigga
I got dreams for the hills nigga...
