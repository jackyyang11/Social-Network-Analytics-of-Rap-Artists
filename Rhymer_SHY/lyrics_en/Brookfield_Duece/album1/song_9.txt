Intro:
Yep, foreal, Hold Up

Hook:
Niggas. Got me. Twisted
I flood
Wrists. Take y'all. Bitches
This is...
Whip it ship it in a glass hoe
Give these niggas what they ask for
Street nigga blame my past hoe
Respect is something imma blast for like (baow)
That way. Hang with. Dread heads
Gunplay
Head shots. Toupee. Niggas
Need pay
Just wanna whip and big chain
Been picking cotton for balmain
Got in the house seen everything
Pops got me my whip and chain

Verse 1:
Pops I know ain’t giving a fuck about me
And mama you resent me
‘cause pop took me to pick cotton
You know I need those new jeans
Pop took me to get the bag
Gave me guns told me get mad
Watch thorns they'll hurt your progress
Trying to escape will be your greatest conquest
Trying, cuz if I'm lying I’m dying pop will kill me for trying to get smart
Trying to run away
And Trying to get heart
They gon give lashes not a nail shop
Sell you cheap like a mom and pop
It's more coming at 4 o'clock
Piled up with the kids on top
Like cherries
But just a little stranger
It's just a little danger
The blood will really stain you
Never show ya anger
They don't like that
They gon fight that
They gon give your ass Jesus
How we gon fight that? (How)

Verse 2:
Mama you don't really care
You let pop drive Silk Road
Pull up on you all big and bold
And take us awaaaaaaaaay
We never seen you again
We never seen our friends
Tried to tell Pop imma king
But he didn't believe me then (nah, damn)
Asked for all of my gold
Got shackles on my wrist
Made of steel
If I steal imma lose a hand for real
Man I should Really chill
That's a good idea
Stay alive that’s a good idea
Mama coming she gon make him feel
All the pain from my people killed
But you never came
Welfare checks on my brain
He don’t like when I'm out my lane
But he love all those big asses
Coming straight from the motherland
I got some little brothers
But they hair straight
And they here straight
And They live in the big house
And They all call me big mouth
Talk too much for my own good
A tree gon hold me up real good
You know what’s funny
You thought I was living the life the whole time
My whole life been a fucking grind
I didn't know you was fucking blind
(Damn, yea yea yea yea)
