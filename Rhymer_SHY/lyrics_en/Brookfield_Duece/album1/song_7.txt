I been navigating my way
I been navigating my way thru the rain
I been navigating my way
I been navigating my way thru the rain
I been navigating my way
I been navigating my way thru the rain
I been navigating my way
I been navigating my way thru the rain

Verse 1:
(Duece)
I be sitting wit my top back
Watching clowns jaw jack
Dreaming of orchestrating the circus need a top hat
Where I'm from the gun clap
Run up on you run that
See this long clip in my stick boy you don't want that
Nah you don't want that
Cops at your front door
Telling your mama and your granny your son done for
She don't know what he gone for
They hoping they find the killer with neighbors help
You knowing they never will cuz people for self
Preservation on the frontline
It's a battle we grinding and ducking fed time
Told my baby be cool when you see the one time
And all the people running with spears like Kevin federline
Damn I need a better sign (yep)
They call me Hollywood now
And I get it cuz seeing stop make me cross the line
I don't think like the other people that's in the grind
I'm surprised when they don't say that I lost my mind

Verse 2:
(Duece)
They separate us no reparations
Just hunger and home invasions
The mind is where they enslave us
Just blame it on how they raise us
Instead of the ghetto where all the people hope god save us
We sit in a building where liars preach to the congregation
Pass the collection plate
The devils we trying to navigate
Lord help me find a way
Im here now and thats better late
That's better late than never
To navigate the weather (oh ohhh)
Hope I keep it together
I Hope i keep it together (oh ohhhh)

Hope I keep it together
Yea! Yea yea!

I been navigating I been navigating
Show me the ways
I need the coordinates
Show me the ways
Show me the ways
I need the coordinates
I need to pray
I feel like prey
I need the ways
I need the coordinates
Show me the way

And the day came when the risk to remain tight In a bud was more painful then the risk it took to blossom
