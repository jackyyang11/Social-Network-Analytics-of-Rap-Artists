[Intro]
It's the holiday
I ain't got it, I ain't got it
I ain't got it, I ain't got it
I ain't got it, I ain't got it

[Verse 1]
Cop a Bandicoot mechanical, I'm in a Santa suit
Tree botanical, on 34th Street I'm a miracle
Not for Comic Con
I'm a muppet boy, the animal
Band of loot, talking point 'n' shoot
I cop it, Canon too
Click and snap feeling photogenic, it's a holiday
Ugly sweater and Nintendo Switches, this is not a game
Metal Gear, give your girl solid on a bean bag
Shenmue, me, and Shane wilding on a Dreamcast
[?] too and I still got it on a big break
Paid for, bout to take a trip down to DC
See me, all I want for X-mas is a free Meek
Free Mill, houses out in Texas and a GT
12 drummers drumming
11 forties something
10 up on my leather
9 [?] for buzzin
8 I got a onion
7 on some crypto
6 on Murakami
5 for all my zombies
4 in different colors
3 I got for mommy
To give these to Bari
And I need me a Atari
Yeah I ain't get it then I'm sorry
Hope I wake up in a 'rari
Seeing clear, I'm in some Cartiers
Wish I woke up with some Barbies
See I woke up to a party
Mixing eggnog with Bacardi
Baby momma gettin' naughty
2K playing, you can't guard me
Ask me bout my momma pad, Balenciaga
Yeah, you want some Prada?
Get some diamonds nigga, know we wilding
Flacko was a model to Picasso, genie with a bottle
Nasty won a shopping spree, afters taxes, lotta G
I just for my poppa
He ain't gotta, nigga know I got him
Smooky want MarGielaa
He can get it, gotta go to college
Fergie want a Rolly, he the brodie
I'ma robocop it
Wealth and health will always follow
Got to do it, golden motto
Living like there's no tomorrow
Christmas for my bro Gelato
Freedom for my brother Lotto
We just hope that God'll guide you
Deck the halls and sing recitals
Let the love and joy inside you
This that Christmas on some Michael
Buying vinyls always titled
Tipsy while I bump Mariah
Ain't no chimney, ain't no fire
Now a nigga stocking stuffing
I can hit the block with muffins
Sending [?] by the dozen
[?] butter
[?] love my brother
[?] beloved
I'ma cop my brother something
Made a present [?]
Remember we was on the corner
Wrapping paper tape for caution
Looking for, [?]
Pocket full of coke, it was cool
Never taking orders
Now we taking trips across the globe
I relate to [?], jingle all the way
Dashie threw this paper
Angels in the snow, I dream of acres
The season of the giving got me feeling greater
Happy holidays, you got a year to save up

[Outro]
Let's get paper
Let's get money
Oh we cheap as hell [?]
Send a card or something man
Groupon man, Cash app, bitcoin [?]
