I love my bitches in Chanel
Niggas in the bank
I make your bitch go bust a cell
Baby j up in the mink

Trigger Twelv ain't want to play my name
Ringing out of space you niggas barely out of state
You niggas running out of time
Need timing on my watch
I got some diamonds on my ring
Got millage on my Glock
I got some pussy in my dreams
I really want to drop so I can park it on my block and tell my niggas they can rock

Bring it back and I was popping in my hood, yeah
Leave it there and I was popping in my hood, yeah
G passing and I was popping in my hood, yeah
