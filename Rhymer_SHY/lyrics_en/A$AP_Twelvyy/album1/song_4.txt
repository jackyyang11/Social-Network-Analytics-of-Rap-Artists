[Intro: Harry Fraud]
La Musica De Harry Fraud

[Verse 1: A$AP Twelvyy]
I've been running through these borderlines
Passport like the Nordstrom Line, it's all tagged up
Young nigga with a 45
Now the whole hood horrified we all masked up
Has them niggas seen a poltergeist?
Hey, crack nigga, roll the dice, get the cash up
Me and lou banga riding in the Porsche
Smoking on gas so you know that bitch gassed up
I've been speeding on the Autobahn
Can't talk, need to to call a car
Better call Tyrone cause a young nigga off of y'all
Slow down like Lord Jamar
Yeah, yeah, with the northern star
Wiling out with an open charge
Fuck around and have court tomorrow
But I better get off them all
'Nough time to watch Oprah, y'all
And I'm young, black and focused, dawg

[Hook: A$AP Twelvyy]
Yeah, I tell them niggas I don't fuck with them, damn
I tell them losers that I love to win, shit
I hope these bitches let me fuck again
Fuck around and fuck a friend, they're like "what's up?" again
Yeah, I tell them niggas I don't fuck with them, yeah
I tell them losers that I love to win, yeah
I hope these bitches let me fuck again
Fuck around and fuck a friend, they're like "what's up?" again

[Verse 2: A$AP Ant]
Popped up on the scene like an airplane
White bitch model sniff cocaine
Getting pictures like I'm Pootie Tang
Feel like king when you hit the Mustang
Yelling out the window, "Money in the thing"
Bitches knees to the ground when they're in the thing
From Baltimore where you hear the shots ring
Soon as you get caught, niggas gonna say
Shied out, catch [?] let your brain say
Like Steph Curry with the bills in the lane
'Bout to get a triple double with you fuck niggas
At the Mossberg [?] quicker
Gotta tell the world, gotta get more richer
Like Roger Clemens, but I'm no picture
Pouring up lean, don't do fucking liquor
I'll fuck that bitch, I don't fucking miss her

[Hook: A$AP Twelvyy]
Yeah, I tell them niggas I don't fuck with them, damn
I tell them losers that I love to win, shit
I hope these bitches let me fuck again
Fuck around and fuck a friend, they're like "what's up?" again
Yeah, I tell them niggas I don't fuck with them, yeah
I tell them losers that I love to win, yeah
I hope these bitches let me fuck again
Fuck around and fuck a friend, they're like "what's up?" again
