I wanna follow the footprints across my lover's stomach
I wanna call out her name before I plummet
I wish I had a map of the terrain
So I could step around the landmines
Avoid the beasts under the bed that bring they bad times

I wanna find these here so-called "treasure"
The pleasure, the trinkets, the never-ending weekends
Acknowledging that I'm still just a piece of the sequence
But seein' these different footprints got me needin' to show my weakness

Timelines, the timezones, I cross 'em with my eyes closed
Memorize the landmarks and learn the cycles
The weather patterns
How the seasons affect the east and the west of each region
Learn the cycles

Forget about the fact that many trails have been tracked
Maybe it's a plus that there's a path
If this was some uncharted land, I'd have to be a smarter man
Willing to travel the farthest to unravel the harvest

The natural resources are unlimited
Exploration only requires some desire and initiative
Take your time to find the right way to climb
It ain't safe to play games with nature's mind

And if I could show you
You would never leave it, never
And if I could show you
You would never leave it, never
And if I could show you
You would never leave it, never
And if I could show you
You would never leave it, never

And if I could show you
You would never leave it, never
And if I could show you
You would never leave me

I wanna ride a train up my lover's arm
Destination: the brain
To climb out and find out what's goin' on
Cut through trees and ride through rocks
And synchronize the universal sundial to my watch

I've seen a lot, but not quite as much as her
To top it off the memory and her imagination blur
I know she's been put through hell, I can feel it
And I know she's touched heaven as well, tryin' to steal it

It came on, it taught her the song
Strung her along, it caught her when that guard was gone
Now to the break of dawn, she's wants to feel that fix
And all her family and friends is tryin' to seal them licks

I ain't dumb, I can hear that train come from miles away
I'm settin' obstacles to stop the arrival
I'm gonna blow up that iron and wood road
From what I understood those be the orifice of her survival

My recital, yet another tantrum
Because she's highly excitable, swinging at random
No happy endings, always off to a bad start
Addictive, voyeurism to the track marks

And if I could show you
You would never leave it, never, no
And if I could show you
You would never leave it, never
And if I could show you, yo
You would never leave it, never
And if I could show you, yo
You would never leave it, never
