Hey, something is new
It got into me and I hope that it got into you
The way my covers are made
Trumpets will play
And I hope that it's inside
I hope that it got into you

There's no doubt
Here lies Amelia Bright
In a red 50's dress
From a thrift shop nearby
I laid on the ground and stared at the sky
With Amelia Bright

There's clothes
That hide them away
There's me spread
All over the floor
And I'm lost in one place
I'm stuck, and I'm straight
And I hope that you feel the same way

There's no doubt
Here lies Amelia Bright
In a red 50's dress
From a thrift shop nearby
I laid on the grass and stared at the sky
With Amelia Bright

There's no doubt
There's nothing to work out
You're alone
'Cause you're always on your own
When you yawn
It makes me want to yawn, too

Plain, expressionless view
It got into you with a necklace, no shoes
The promise of truth
And a life to be bright and new

There's no doubt
Here lies Amelia Bright
Over the bars of the graveyard at night
I laid on the grass
And stared at the sky
With Amelia Bright
With Amelia Bright
With Amelia Bright
