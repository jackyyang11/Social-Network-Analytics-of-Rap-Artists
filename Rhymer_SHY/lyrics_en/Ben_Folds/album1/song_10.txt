[Verse 1]
Pull over the car
Pull over the car
I think I see some sweet squirrel rim
Pull over the car (really)
Pull over the car
I think I feel like King Tut again

[Chorus]
I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't wanna
You make me feel
Make me feel
Make me feel retarded

[Verse 2]
I can't leave it alone
I jerk off on the phone (yeah)
I want you to come on over
Pretty bad idea
Pretty bad idea (really bad idea)
Really, really bad idea

[Chorus]
I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't wanna
You make me feel
Make me feel
Make me feel retarded
Retarded
You make me feel so...

[Piano Solo]
Oh, yeah okay
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

[Verse 3]
When I stood you up
I thought that you'd give up
Now I realize you're just like a dog

[Chorus]
I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't wanna
You make me feel
Make me feel
Make me feel retarded
Retarded
Retarded
