*Note: this album (and obviously song) are by Ben Folds as a
Solo artist, not Ben Folds Five. The correction form doesn't allow
You to change the artist, so i put it here.*
And so
Annie waits annie waits annie waits
For a call
From a friend
The same
It's the same, why's it always the same?
Annie waits
For the last
Time
The clock never stops never stops never waits
She's growin' old
It's gettin' late
And so he forgot he forgot maybe not
Maybe he's been seriously hurt
Would that be worse?
Headlights crest the hill
Shadows pass her by and out of sight
Hooo hooo
Annie sees in dreams
Friday bingo, pigeons in the park
Annie waits for the last time
Just the same as the last time
Annie says
You see?
This is why i'd rather be
Alone
And so
Annie waits annie waits annie waits
For a call
From a friend
The same
It's the same
Why's it always the same?
Annie waits
As the last
Headlights crest the hill
Who will be the one forever more
Hooo hooo
Annie i could be
If we're both still lonely when we're old
Annie waits for the last time
Just the same as the last time
Annie waits for the last time
Just the same as the last time
Annie waits
But not for me
