[Stevie Wonder]
Cause there's always a flaw in the diamond
A lightning-fork crack in the pearl
A fault in the rock of the island
And it's usually shaped like a girl, girl

[Stevie Wonder]
Leave us lost in the rust and the rubble
Nine exits north of Las Vegas, Vegas
Nine exits north of Las Vegas, Vegas
Nine exits north of Las Vegas

[Stevie Wonder]
I was the first one to see her
And you were the first one to fall
Like a half-drunken downhill skier
And she was the oncoming wall
Now I get that it's all gone awry
A joke I might like to take back
Wipe a bright star from the night sky
Nothing can fill in the black
