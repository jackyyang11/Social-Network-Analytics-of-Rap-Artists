[Intro]
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday

[Verse 1: Translee]
Nothing on Monday is mundane
I take your hoe out for Mongolian chicken
Money come first, then money come second
If anything else that's the monkey's[?] business
Tuesdays can go two ways, I get two babes (two babes)
They're like too 2 Chainz, I bust two nuts and have two babies
This shit is crazy
Gamblin' like I'm in [?]
But giving that coochie a tune-up
We'll be flowers, my dick a rose
And she can just give it her two lips
Well, Wednesday is still win-day
'Cause we win-win until [?]
And we makin' noise like windbreakers
Might pull up in the Winnebago
Thursday is just thirst day
The thirst is real 'cause she's here to stay
[?] going for the home run, by letting me hit third base
See Friday is get fried day
My brain cooling off [?]
If I can go that hard through the week
Weekends ain't meant for me

[Hook: Translee]
I'm doped  up, high as fuck
Flexed out, rocked up
Break the law, locked up
Bad guy, guaped up
I'm doped up, high as fuck
Flexed out, rocked up
Break the law, locked up
Bad guy, guaped up

[Verse 2: Zip k]
It's Monday again
Fumblin, bumblin
Throw on my getup
My whip I get in
The corners I bend
808s bumpin'
It's something bout rolling
I go to my friends
Sometimes you pretend nothing is wrong with the world
Who am I kidding?
But we got a whole week ahead of us
Fuck it, we gotta get up
Only one life to live
Tuesday I'm in the studio getting it
Wednesday I'm doing what I did Tuesday
Thursday I said I prayer for these other rappers
I release Friday, and that's doomsday
I'm just tryna get ahead, that's toupee
So I hit hard, that's Boucher
I want a sold out show where they kick and push to get in
That's Lupe
It's Saturday now
The Friday nightcap is the cause and effect for what's happenin' now
Sunday I chill on a lyrical bounce
You just want something smooth to ride to when you out
And I gotcha babe, what's poppin' babe?
Outta all those clothes, what's droppin' babe?
I got a little to lose with a lot to say
And every week it's about the same
Zip K

[Hook: Translee]
I'm doped  up, high as fuck
Flexed out, rocked up
Break the law, locked up
Bad guy, guaped up
I'm doped up, high as fuck
Flexed out, rocked up
Break the law, locked up
Bad guy, guaped up

[Interlude: Translee]
I appreciate everyday I'm given
I ain't trippin'
Gotta asses the power of 24 hours
We can climb leaps and bounds
If we're bound to leap

[Verse 3: Translee]
I take it day-to-day with the [?] in no safer place
And my church now accept visa, I gotta pay to  pray
Tryna stay away from them 5-0, call 'em shades of gray
It's [?] game, my nigga tryna score and I shake-and-bake
