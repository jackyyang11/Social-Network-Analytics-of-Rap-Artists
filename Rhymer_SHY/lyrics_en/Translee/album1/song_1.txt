Chorus [Eddy Fontane]:
You live and you die but the world still turns
Just another speed to burn
Hey, hey, hey
Is the American way!
I wanna make a lot of money, more that I can spend
Wake up and do it again
Hey, hey, hey
Is the American way!

Verse 1 [Translee]
I like to say it, my artistry is so mosaic
I just replay it in my head and then relay it
I can't recall everything I had learned in social studies
But these social networks, they keep my social buzzing
Yeah, and legalize marijuana, please
Let's get these people out of jail just for blowing trees
Too many inequalities on how that shit is punished
Here convicted, there a ticket, man, that shit is rubbish
Capitalism, communism, what's the fucking difference?
We're still human beings, living underneath the system
Just know your government pathological lies
It's classified as G5 to camouflage our demise

Chorus [Eddy Fontane]:
You live and you die but the world still turns
Just another speed to burn
Hey, hey, hey
Is the American way!
I wanna make a lot of money, more that I can spend
Wake up and do it again
Hey, hey, hey
Is the American way!

Verse 2 [Translee]
And you know the news some bullshit, please believe in me
The same people running that, is running BET
And I say that for you to know the news is a business
Who run by shareholders with their own intentions
And I'm a college grad who could have made it out the high school
But I know the drive, you need to make it, what's inside you
And where am I at, you take that, won't you?
I'm Joe Clark y'all Thomas Sams you smoke crack, don't you?

('You smoke crack, don't you?
Look at me boy
Don't you smoke crack?'
'Yes, sir!'
'Now I say, if you wanna kill yourself
Don't fuck around, go and do an expeditiously)

You must be out your mind to think that I'mma be deceiving
Every evening steady scheming on the things that we believe in
Mama died from a disease but there's cures to defeat it
But the selfish fucking heathens make too much money treatin it
The soldiers that retreated welfare still depleted
Black men always leaving when the girl says they'll keep it
I got a million reasons to be a part of that legion
Never been in that position, but old heads say keep breathing
Good evening

Chorus [Eddy Fontane]:
You live and you die but the world still turns
Just another speed to burn
Hey, hey, hey
Is the American way!
I wanna make a lot of money, more that I can spend
Wake up and do it again
Hey, hey, hey
Is the American way!

Every time a black person makes the money
No wait I take that back
An American black person get money
Why he gotta be in illuminati
Why he can't just get money?
