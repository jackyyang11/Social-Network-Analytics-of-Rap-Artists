Yo U Want Me To Start Whenever The Beat Drop?

[Hook] x2
Ayo, Ayo, Ayo, AYO
Waitress Bring Me Vodka
Kuz I brought my own Faygo
Bitches On My Team Bad Body

Now We Got Her Friends Belly Dancin On The Table

[Verse: Translee]

You Ain't Gots To Hate This
Simply kuz you ain't this
But if you want to hate this

Sign that wait list
I got a slot for you to hate on me next May 5th
But Im gon be on Mercury
So You Gon Need That Spaceship
Ooo we bout to take shit
Two Different Locations
Use to hittin girls
Then get standin ovations
This is motivation
Swea I do not fake shit
Yes I got that California Kushion as my fragrance
OK BITCH

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2: Translee]
Ok im always on that scene
Particularly be to clean
My symphony play them strings
These women they play for keeps
Her house is where im crashin
My flow be dumb still rockin them nerd glasses
She take me as is
Doper than the dope itself (dope itself)
Matter fact im the last
There ain't no one else
My Fahrenheit too hott
To live that married life
Plus im in too deep
BARRY WHITE
O dis dat HYPE
NIGGA

[Hook] x2

[Verse 3: Translee]
My music is perfected
My style is so eclectic
Im feelin copacetic
But them bitches say I wrecked it
Crash into a C-Note
I kick my feet up on hammocks in
Portofino
Control that money like managing a casino
I sip that pinot grigio
I hear no see no evil
I do this for the people
Im rockin out
My diamond watch is out
O im gon turn her over
And shake her pockets out
No Doubt
