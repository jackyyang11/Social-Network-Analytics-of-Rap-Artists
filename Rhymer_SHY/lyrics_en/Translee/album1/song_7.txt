Old School 4 Door

[Verse 2]
Im Not in love with the club
Rather be at a cafe
A true alcoholic
Put a lil of that champagne in my latte
SO Classy
Know Translee
Cool a Nigga off then hit replay
First to ever sell dreams on ebay
Thinkin so big mind on freeway
Im the real smart guy muh fug T.J
Im tryna get it
But im dressed like I already got it
Obsessed with makin deposits
And sex with girls in apartments
We cooler than we thought we was
They had to let us know
And now they know
We know
She know
He know
This shits incredible

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Watch I pull up on you
In that European Vehicle
Limousine tent
Paparazzi ain't no seein through
Look at what we been through
Seein me is seein proof
Leavin me is leavin truth
And truth dont like to leave the booth
Born in them dirt roads of Leesburg, GA
To a condo in the middle of my tour bus
I be gettn everything that money can't afford ya
Introduce my PORSCHE to Miami Beach, Florida
