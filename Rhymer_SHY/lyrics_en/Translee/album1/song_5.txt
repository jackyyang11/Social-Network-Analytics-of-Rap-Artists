[Verse]
Ok my presence in this land
Is like treasure in the sand
I tried several different plans
Thought i'd never get the chance
I really really real
Want them to know me in Japan
Konnichiwa ??
Them hoes know what im sayin
Went to college graduate
Sold some weed for bout two weeks
Tired of niggas callin late
Aye man I need to get some sleep
You be bout that bullshittin man
And we's about them freaks
Thinking it's my lucky night
I found some trees up off the street
Had that 96 Impala
Best believe its not Caprice
After sexual intercourse
I believe that its capisci
Dadadada im collar poppin
Prada's not what im coppin
I'm saving and stackin money you lamin
And actin funny
Im wavin back at you dummies
I gave you the magic formula
Yall did not act accordingly
Yall jus got back to borin me
I just be fast-forwarding
All of your wack choruses
Why you still wearing
That old throwback
Brad Daugherty
(hahahaha)
(throwback Brad Daugherty)
Still rappin past 40
(still rappin past 40)
That old lame sad story
Kids cocaine is bad for ya

[Hook]
Chicken Heads and Heffers
Hot Wings and Strippers
Bitch Im Big Willie Tonight
(Bitch Im Big Willie Tonight)
We Got Hotel Rooms and Bitches
She Got On A Robe and Slippers
Im Big Willie Nillie Tonight
(Im Big Willie Nillie Tonight)

[Verse 2]
How you deal with the stares
In a rooms for a squares
How you pick the bad apple
In a room full of pears
My life is going up and down so much I need a level
And this Kanye old bitch kuz she remind me of the devil
DAMN
Thats an Onomatopoeia
Dreamin of the day when I fill up a coliseum
She forgot about Lil Buddy
She dont even wanna see em
I dont mean to call em bitches
But I call em how I see em
And I ain't ballin out the GM
But my future look so bright
Its lookin like a done deal
Buildin up a buzz so dont be a buzz kill
Kuz I dont wanna shoot you
BUT MY LIL THUG WILL
Well im comin from a city betta known as huntsville
Niggas got that doctor money
Off of fuckin drug deals
You dont need education to be living upscale
When I finish with this rappin hope you say I done well
Hell

[Hook]
