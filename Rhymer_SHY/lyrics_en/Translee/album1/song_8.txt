(Chorus – Eddy Fontane)
They hate the government
They hate the president
And they don’t even know why but that’s irrelevant
They hate sunshine
And they hate the rain
And even though they inside, they still complain
Daddy hates momma and momma hates dad
But why the kids ass out sitting round sad
Dropping tears on the floor
Does anybody love anymore (3x)
Does anybody love (2x)
Does anybody love anymore (2x)
Does anybody love (2x)
Yeah

[Verse 1 – Translee]
Born in America, product of the television
My daddy wasn’t rich, so what is nepotism
Felt like the preacher tried to drown me at my baptism
I seen a man gunned down cuz how his hat was twisted
I seen the judge throw the book at the innocent
I seen the guilty walk free and he who did the shit
You hate the fucking system
You hate the law officials
But when some shit pop off, I bet you called ‘em didn’t you?
We hate our way of life, but won’t do nothing to change it
And dreams of being famous only thing that seem amazing
We hate job, but most of all, hate what our job is paying
I’m just looking for love
That’s all I’m saying

](Chorus – Eddy Fontane)
They hate the government
They hate the president
And they don’t even know why but that’s irrelevant
They hate sunshine
And they hate the rain
And even though they inside, they still complain
Daddy hates momma and momma hates dad
But why the kids ass out sitting round sad
Dropping tears on the floor
Does anybody love anymore (3x)
Does anybody love (2x)
Does anybody love anymore (2x)
Does anybody love (2x)
Yeah

[Verse 2 – Translee]
See we going places
Don’t you understand?
I’m bout to land this motherfucker in the motherland
And people hate taxes, they hate Uncle Sam
They hate Lebron James, and Kim Kardashian
We love the drama, but hate the consequence
We love being on stage but hate the audience
And we don’t raise kids, we let the block do it
And we don’t teach ‘em lessons, we let the cops do it
We hate the price of gas, we hated Michael Jack
Until he died, now everybody wanting Michael back
For one more spin move
One more moon walk
He represented love
So what do you talk?

(Chorus – Eddy Fontane)
They hate the government
They hate the president
And they don’t even know why but that’s irrelevant
They hate sunshine
And they hate the rain
And even though they inside, they still complain
Daddy hates momma and momma hates dad
But why the kids ass out sitting round sad
Dropping tears on the floor
Does anybody love anymore (3x)
Does anybody love (2x)
Does anybody love anymore (2x)
Does anybody love (2x)
Does anybody love anymore (2x)
Does anybody love (2x)

[Outro-Translee (Eddy Fontane)]
Does anybody love? (yeah)
I don’t think so (La-da-da-daa)
I think the thin line between love and hate as gotten thicker (da-da)
It’s progressively gotten wider (does anybody love)
We seem to hate everything... (anymore anymore)
Everything (does anybody love)
Where’s the love?...
(Does anybody?)
