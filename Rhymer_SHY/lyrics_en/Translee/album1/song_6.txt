[Verse 1]
Everything high
How to make a living man, how to get high
Quarter sack will be enough to get me to my highness
Usually I go and get the package out the projects
I know a young nigga that I buy from
Put me over everything like Viacom
Buy a bong from him, know it's for a good cause
The nigga got kids think he's still Santa Claus
Who am I not to support?
'Cause I support my own habit
D&D[?] for cigarillo and matches
I'm high now, rapping while the time pass
But the fun part was really getting to the climax

[Hook]
Climax
Getting to the climax

[Verse 2]
[?] in the parking lot, I'm really like a vulture
My only intention is to get a couple numbers
Didn't hit the club 'cause the let out is free
And the girls already how you want them to be
Scream I'm going to the waffle house, a ratchet hoe's gourmet
Waffle, orange juice, bacon and a sorbet
[?] smother if you wanna add some more taste
Straight eight[?], now we headed to this whore's place
Using rubber, I ain't really tryna die fast
Girl, I won't broadcast this shit like Comcast
Ten minutes and I'm bustin' on ya fine ass
But the fun part is really getting to the climax

[Hook]
Climax
Getting to the climax

[Verse 3]
Patiently been waiting on the day that I can break through
And when somebody ask about my shit, I have some good news
Matter of fact they won't have to ask 'cause they'll know it
It won't be hard to get get a show [?]
And the flow so fresh, so ripe, it's still growing
Still flowing, I'm the real president, Michelle know it
I'm a playa' that didn't fall back, I fell forward
My good friends ran more base than [?]
I'm just grinding 'til I'm major
Engineer is Chris Hunter, got Todd on the beat
Know I'm lyrically a wonder
In the booth with bitches and I wine glass
'Cause I know the fun part is getting to the climax

[Hook]
Climax
Getting to the climax

[Bridge]
Don't forget about the come up

[Verse 4]
Now for shits and giggles I'ma rap a fucking little
Ballin' like I'm Kerry Kittles, we eat like a bag of skittles
I ain't playing second-fiddle to somebody in the middle
I'm up later than Jay Leno killing everybody denim[?]
All them rules you wanna break, somehow I found a way to bend 'em
And we pack 'em up and send 'em
You say do 'em and we did 'em
Say we get 'em and we got 'em
And we brought 'em and we slaughter 'em
In front of you, your point of view is nothing new, it's comical
I travel like a vagabond
Fresher than a Dapper Don
Gotta be the coldest nigga rappin' through a Avalanche
Ran outta drank, know my bottle keep a tag-a-long
Enjoy it while I can 'cause the top is not what's happenin'[?]
