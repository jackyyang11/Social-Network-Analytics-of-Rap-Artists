[Verse 1:]
They say they make a move
They ain't moving forward, they just movin' - and booin'
Like restless sleepers letting dreams come sooner
We are guilty, we have played the games
Getting out of place cause we need to feel like the winners feel
When he get the girl, and he kissed the ring
He gon' make me, then I'm gon' make 'em sing
Ohhhhhh (That's right)
Ohhhhhh (That's right)
Hey, hey, hey, hey

[Hook:]
One step forward, two steps back
Two left feet, can't do that dance
Ohhhhhh
Ohhhhhh (Can't do that, that...)
Hey, hey, hey, hey
One step forward, two steps back
Two left feet, can't do that dance (Can't do that dance, I can't do that dance)
Ohhhhhh
Ohhhhhh
Hey, hey, hey, hey

[Verse 2:]
They say they make a move
They ain't moving forward, they just movin', and movin'
Like restless sleepers letting dreams come sooner
Am I one of them?
Running in the wind
I'm standing still on a carousel, while the world unveils
Writing out these wills, finding time to kill
I'm gon' make me here, and I'm gon' make 'em stay
Ohhhhhh
Ohhhhhh
Hey, hey, hey, hey

[Hook:]
One step forward, two steps back
Two left feet, can't do that dance
Ohhhhhh
Ohhhhhh
Hey, hey, hey, hey
One step forward, two steps back
Two left feet, can't do that dance
Ohhhhhh
Ohhhhhh
Hey, hey, hey, hey
