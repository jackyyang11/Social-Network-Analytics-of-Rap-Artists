[Intro: Bernz]
No no!
No no!

[Verse 1: Bernz]
I'm just in a different place;
See you on the other side!
Everyday a different state
This my everyday state-of-mind
Me and you are not the same
Wanna take a shot? Get in line
Never been the one to play it safe
Not at all motherfucker, never been the type, noooo!
I done heard all the shit that you said
It didn't go over my head cause the wordplay lackin'
In the end, when the signals sent
We'll know the real one, better cry a reaction
Who gon' pull up with their Giga's blasting and their windows down, seat-belt unfastened?
Homie don't get mad, I'm just askin':
Tell me what the hell happened!

[Hook: Bernz]
Oh no! (x2)
That shit don't go
It don't go
Sorry to be the one to say you not dope
You said it's bangin', but that shit do not go
Like oh no!

[Verse 2: Bernz]
I don't like the way they always all up in my kitchen
Trying to get the recipe for all them things I'm whippin'
It's so good to change your mood and make you lose your bitches
So when I be cheffin', all you left with is the fucking dishes
I'm like oh no, them boys, they lost all their souls
Them all believe what they've been told
They eat that feed, but they ain't grow
They on their knees, cause they need more
They all pee wees trying to get swole
I'm on my feet watching them go
I just don't lean towards them and know:

[Hook: Bernz & (Ubiquitous)]
Oh no! (x2)
That shit don't go
It don't go
Sorry to be the one to say you not dope (Uh!)
You said it's bangin', but that shit do not go (No!)
Like oh no!

[Verse 3: Ubiquitous]
When the beat go droppin'
And I'm Rico Suave-ing
I kill 'em while the people watchin'
I mean, even the police won't stop him
We got it going on, you gonna get it
Whatever you did done, you never run livid
I run [?] you better come with it
I never run, dippin' the tip of my tongue in it
The sun lit it
Said "I'm pickin' the drum, hit it"
Pleasure the principle lyric unto the unfinished
This become finished, I'm on my regimen
I better [?] my efforts, you get the evidence
I regulate, am I reppin' level of respect?
They never payin' respect, settin' in debt
I better spray when the neck of metal connects
You better pray if it's detrimental to ces, boy!

[Hook: Bernz]
Oh no! (x2)
That shit don't go
It don't go
Sorry to be the one to say you not, though
You said it's bangin, but that shit do not go
Like oh no!

[Verse 4: Godemis]
Everybody wanna fuck me over
But I'm over being fucked!
I don't ever wanna talk about it
I don't even wanna beef shit up
It's cool, homie, I'm out here
And I'm well aware that they hating on me
Tight grip on that gear shift, but the weird shit is they can't control me
I'm too wavy with two ladies
I tell them about it, but it's too crazy
Shit, ain't much to do lately
I'm gonna turn it up 'till it's 280
Everybody thinking it's a race
They wanna match the pace, they now how to play me
But, regardless of that fight, I'll say this shit don't G-O like Kali Baby!

[Hook: Bernz] (x2)
Oh no! (x2)
That shit don't go
It don't go
Sorry to be the one to say you not, though
You said it's bangin', but that shit do not go
Like oh no!

[Outro:]
Oh no!
Oh no!
