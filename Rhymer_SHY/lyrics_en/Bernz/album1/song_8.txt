[Verse 1:]
Trying to build for the day that it all flat plains right in front of my face
Cause it's all just a case, and a rat in the cage and he running to play
I been trying to kill time every word that I rhyme but it's all just a waste
I get lured by the lights and it's all just a price that you pay when you living in (when you living in, when you living in) space
Everybody wanna get a little piece when you high in the streets
Yeah they all wanna leech of the blood of a young-gun full of gusto
Had the same motherfuckers who would ask for a favor
Now I don't call back at all when the phone rung for the hundo'
And it go...

[Hook:]
That's just the way it goes (x2)
That's just the way it's layed out
That's just the way it goes
That's just the way it's layed out
(No matter how, no matter where, no matter why)
That's just the way it goes
That's just the way it's layed out
(No matter where, no matter what, no matter...)
That's just the way it goes
That's just the way it's layed out (layed out)

[Verse 2:]
We could blame it on the grand design
Blame it on our state-of-mind
She wanna blame the drugs, that's fine
When in time it'll all be (layed out)
I remember that night going fast
Back rows while we watched [?]
Don't know when I finally crashed, by the time that I came to, I was (layed out)
The older I get, the less I know, cause that's the way it's been (layed out)
No time to kill, I'm on my own
Gotta force myself to just vibe out
Matter of fact, I need meditation
More time to spend on odd occupations
End my relations with all my patients, yeah I got 'em waiting and (layed out)

[Bridge:]
Do your thing, drink your drink, smoke your spliff
Let it go, let it fly, let it drift
Feel yourself, feel your vibe, you the shit
Empty roads on your own, time to dip

[Hook:]
That's just the way it goes (x2)
That's just the way it's layed out
That's just the way it goes
That's just the way it's layed out
(No matter how, no matter where, no matter why)
That's just the way it goes
That's just the way it's layed out
(No matter where, no matter what, no matter...)
That's just the way it goes
That's just the way it's layed out

[Outro:]
(Layed out, layed out)
That's just the way it's layed out
