[Hook: Helen Tess]
Shadows
Chasing shadows
Or are they chasing me

[Verse 1: Bernz]
Been at this for a minute, resurrected more than once
Late nights to early mornings, eyes burn from lack of slum -
Ber, I make 'em slur under a cloud of smoke and herb
And social lubricants, used to then lubricate their [?]
Sneak in some sleep when no ones looking
Behind the stage while symbols crash, and random club I'm booked in
I'm out performing for my kind, and they shoving and pushing
I'm out surfing over their minds and they providing cushion...Search
I don't get mad if I'm overlooked in their mags
See, the race's longer than all these blogger's half-assed paragraphs
So will they last? I don't know
The beast is so hungry, we all liable to go
Since I was just a child, I would beg for this shit out loud
And keep my guardian angels up, mental masturbating for hours
Try to master as many styles as I can before my goodbyes
At least that's what I say when I wonder if I wasted my life

[Hook: Helen Tess] (x2)
Shadows
Chasing shadows
Or are they chasing me

[Bridge: Bernz]
If I turn the lights down, I can see you disappear
But when they come back on I'm positive you start to interfere
And I'm addicted to the flicker, the flash and the liquor
But every time I light it up, the shadow gets thicker

[Verse 2: Bernz]
Despite our best attempts to rid ourselves of past mistakes
I find me chasing shadows that I'm scared to face
So now my family's facing things that could leave some disgrace
After a life of fairy tales, I'm now lying awake
Do you believe in American dreams, hittin' this country to get a degree
Workin' few jobs just to make a tuition, then pick up another to buy food to eat
Schooled in the ways of the capital taste, go get your money or get out the way
Step over bodies as if it's a hobby, until they decide that this boy's out of place
Then they take all your things
Hope you got money [?] cause these boys hope that the people don't win
They want us to all stay asleep on our feet so they keep trying to buy these new things
I guess that they think that we dumb
I guess that they think that we probably too busy, in love with the shadow we made under the sun

[Hook: Helen Tess] (x4)
Shadows
Chasing shadows
Or are they chasing me
