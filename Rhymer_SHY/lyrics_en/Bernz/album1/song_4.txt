[Intro]
Yeah, uh huh, check it, woo, uh

[Verse 1:]
By the time you hear from me again
It'll probably be gossip from your friends
Getting wrong all the who, what, wheres, and the whens
Scrolling on my face, and just keep tabs on where I've been
But do they understand where I stand?
Or have they just been blinded by the things they think they have
See my native tongue is spittin' harder than your thirty mag
And I got a second act that'll keep the whole venue packed
See I deviated from paths
Dilated my pupils, the situation's so crucial, resistance to it is futile, we passing these passing fads
And I'm sorry I gotta go but now you know!

[Hook:]
I just came to say goodbye, bye, bye, bye, bye
See I just came to say goodbye, bye, bye, bye, bye
I just came to say goodbye, bye, bye, bye, bye
See I just came to say goodbye, bye, bye, bye, bye

[Verse 2:]
Here 'till they gone tomorrow
So I light my cigarro
Put drums to the pianos
Spit lyrics, never swallows
Reality bizarro, industry so hollow
See I'm 'bout to get my shit together and just say I'm out yo, Let's get wild though
Turn it up, roof ain't lit, burn it up
I ain't 'bout to waste a second, ain't the type to wear our welcomes
So get yourself your helpings while I'm still out here reppin'
Cause I know only when I'm gone is when you feel my presence
Lately I've been watchin', observing the world and plottin'
Thinking that we've forgotten ourselves in a search for profit
Cause that's how we do: experience missed connections
So from now on I'm gon' be me, won't be no misconceptions
You see I'm conscious of the channel, and trophies on the mantle
Head against the wall, and burnt fingers from midnight candles
Probably more obsessed than your average listener or rapper
I'll redefine what I'm after, and what I'm trying to attract to cause I

[Hook:]
I just came to say goodbye, bye, bye, bye, bye
See I just came to say goodbye, bye, bye, bye, bye
I just came to say goodbye, bye, bye, bye, bye
See I just came to say goodbye, bye, bye, bye, bye
