[Intro]
Niggas nowadays, I just think they ungrateful.  Ya know’m sayin’? They come in and out of the game.  They give up, ya know’m sayin’?  They don't really struggle and hustle and do what they gotta do (true).  I remember back in the days, ya know’m sayin’?  Remember like, you couldn't afford, like, Fruity Pebbles.  We had Kabooms (Kabooms, yeah).  Ya know’m sayin’? (*laughs*).  Ya know, you know you couldn't afford Captain Crunch.  You had King Vitamins, ya know’m sayin’?  It came in the bag, ya nah’mean?  Kids nowadays don't understand, ya know’m sayin’?  You gotta do what you gotta do to get on and struggle and survive in this game, ya nah’mean?  That's real though

[Verse 1]
I got knowledge condensed in the space of my brain
Words, definitions, and cultures from Africa to Spain
You know my name, so I won't repeat it
Just know that I could do any type of job when the work is needed
That's why I stopped gettin’ weeded
I stopped cigarettes too, cold turkey, because I ain't need it
All you need is will, power, strength, and faith—believe it
Anything you set your mind to do, you can achieve it
All that negative no-can-do attitude, delete it
Pray to whoever you pray to: Allah, Jah, or Jesus
I dropped outta high school but in my mind I'm a genius
So I made it further than dudes with a GED did
Then I reached in the deepness of creases
Read books and Shakespearian masterpieces
Burned textbooks given out by my teachers
That's why history to me is feces, I exorcise those demons
Those who are fictitious and facetious
Don't get it twisted.  This ain't my album—it's a thesis
Written with heart and soul, better than decent
Blood, sweat, and tears just to hear the cheers from the bleachers

[Hook]
You gotta grind, you gotta struggle, you gotta hustle to get {anything}
In this world you need.  Plus, hard work and pain
If you afraid to bleed to achieve {Anything}
From fame to love, from name to shine
You gotta move fast, can't waste your time.  I did {Anything}
To create a new flow, let's get it and go
And if you fuck up, only Heaven'll know {Anything}
‘Cause anything goes

[Verse 2]
I rocked one pair of sneakers per school year, now listen
If they got scuffed, I covered it up with Riffin
My Mom sewed the holes in the kitchen
My clothes got sewed so much it looked like my clothes got stitches
So I went to school tryin’ not to look bummy
And I swore one day, when I got my hands on some money
I'd take the twelve inch cuffs out of my jeans so I wouldn't look funny
But Mummy got a good job and now I'm fillin’ my tummy
God bless her for the support so we wouldn't stay hungry
Puttin’ name brands on our back—now we look like new money
So fresh, so clean, so now all the girls gonna want me
And fifth racists grade girls wanna dry hump me
We takin’ week long trips, drivin’ cross-country
In a new family whip, the neighborhood loved me
Watching a portable TV in the back, I feel lucky
Laughing at Fred, smack Lamont and call him "big dummy"
And this, all because of my Moms—big up
My Dad was around, but when he passed, she didn't give up
She worked hard to keep her chin up and dress her kids up
We did... {Anything}

[Hook]
You gotta grind, you gotta struggle, you gotta hustle to get {anything}
In this world you need.  Plus, hard work and pain
If you afraid to bleed to achieve {Anything}
From fame to love, from name to shine
You gotta move fast, can't waste your time.  I did {Anything}
To create a new flow, let's get it and go
And if you fuck up, only Heaven'll know {Anything}
‘Cause anything goes

[Verse 3]
My songs are scripted from visions of the past
I've lived different lives, I'm one of the last
Poets, my motive is to show kids
My flow is the closest to what a G.O.A.T. is
The most gifted of all time to ever hold a mic and explode it
Rebuild it to a golden rod, I get respect from the older gods
To represent this culture hard and promote it
What's the odds of me makin’ it to the hills on my lawn
And being the only owner of like four hundred cars
I'm tryin’ to make numbers like Avon
But I remain’ underground, me and my squad
I wanna be on the cover of Fortune 500 burnin’ some chron’
I wanna own the first company to employ all of the ghetto
For good paying jobs, so I pray to God
For help, wisdom, and a million for my moms
So when the mic is in my palm, I spit it like I was strapped to a bomb
Get it right, don't get it twisted
I'm grown now, so the rich and lavish life: I'm tryin’ to live it
Without the same attitude of some of you midgets
I want my son to know his dad had a humbler image

[Hook]
You gotta grind, you gotta struggle, you gotta hustle to get {anything}
In this world you need.  Plus, hard work and pain
If you afraid to bleed to achieve {Anything}
From fame to love, from name to shine
You gotta move fast, can't waste your time.  I did {Anything}
To create a new flow, let's get it and go
And if you fuck up, only Heaven'll know {Anything}
‘Cause anything goes
