[Verse 1: Block McCloud and Pumpkinhead]
[Block McCloud]
It’s been a long time (What?).  I never left you
Take me out of Brooklyn, I’ma still gonna rep you
Spit it in the face of any hard-rock that I’ll step to
Helped me get through.  That’s why I’m never gonna forget you
[Pumpkinhead]
I got memories of BK in the corner of my mind like barber stripes
Kings County been a part of my life ever since I could remember
Born in Brooklyn, Jewish hospital on September
17th, ’75, where they left my moms
Bloody on a gurney.  My pops was worried
‘Cause we lived in the PJs, LG, 415
I ain’t dumb.  I’ma spit all sixteen like
[Block McCloud]
Ayyo, “Hold up, wait a minute”
Manhattan keeps on making it.  (Brooklyn keeps on taking it)
Herb niggas that ain’t from here keep on faking it
We heard, niggas, it ain’t no fair.  We gonna skate with it
This shit’s from Brooklyn.  You can’t Harlem Shake to this
Black Timbs, black durag, black Ablerex
Home of the gangster bitch—they’re quite dangerous
Shady chicks chasing whips, giving face to this

[Verse 2: Block McCloud and Pumpkinhead]
[Pumpkinhead]
Wyckoff, Gowanus, home of The Dodgers
‘Til I’m gone, I’ll promise to hold it down in honor
Where I’m from, partner.  7-1-8
1-1-2-1-7, we call it Medina
[Block McCloud]
Home of the schemer, Crown Heights dreads
Roaming the Beamers, teen thugs with chromed-out ninas
When names hold weight and no credit without collateral
U.S.A. [?] and Brooklyn’s the capital
[Pumpkinhead]
P—that’d be me.  Yo, I’m chilling
Like a villain with my team sitting in front of the building
[Block McCloud]
Block sitting on the dock of the bay
7-1-8 flip "1-8-7s" like Dr. Dre
Brooklyn is the borough and a state of mind
You trying to fake it and you’ll find that it’s a waste of time
I live in Staten now, but wish I could move closer to
When I reminisce over you, my doll

[Verse 3: Pumpkinhead]
I’m like Superman with a BK on my chest
Rep the place of my birth ‘til the date of my death
We spit heat like three pistols.  We from where you
Out of town, holler, “BK!” and women want to sleep with you
Don’t be simple.  Some of us got deep issues
We’ll deep-six you.  You’ll leave crippled with your meat tissue
Hanging off you cheek dimple.  Looking like a toxic Avenger
Skate out of town like Wyclef and won’t be back ‘til November
Got to pack up the Jetta
Go to Boston, holler at Germ to stack up the cheddar
Brooklyn, I’ll be back.  I’m never gon’ forget ya
I’m always gonna rep ya.  Remember?  Remember?

[Bridge: Pumpkinhead] (x2)
It’s been a long time.  We never left you
Take us out of Brooklyn and we still gonna rep you
