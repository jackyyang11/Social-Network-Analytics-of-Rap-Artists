[Intro – Pumpkinhead]
Yeah, we finally here y'all
Pumpkinhead, Marco Polo
This is the album right here, "Orange Moon Over Brooklyn"
SoulSpazm, c'mon let's go!

[Verse 1 – Pumpkinhead]
This is the beginning of greatness.  I broke out the Matrix
Take a deep breath, open up your platelets
And take this and make this your own, face it
In case kids try to recreate this in clone
I was born of a different breed, a bloodline of kings
Downloaded into your dreams in the form of MP3
Been on two labels—one took a break, the other folded
They didn't understand what I had was golden
A leader amongst thieves, a warrior amongst men
Since the age of 13, a savant with a pen
Put me in front of a microphone, I'll spit out a gem
Covered in phlegm.  Music, I make it rough to the end
Brooklyn-born and bred and I got the solution
Drop all your acts, clean up your roster, stop the pollution
Kids watchin’ illusions on TV, brainwashed
So I wanna divert they attention and try not to lose 'em
Are you with me?  Or is this too much rebellion?
Pumpkinhead is what they call me but I've been nicknamed a hellion
I'm the fallin’ of the Berlin’ Wall, the end of apartheid
The feelin’ of comin’ home from war and seein’ your moms with her arms wide
I should be on the list of your all-time favorites
Luckily, I have patience; amazingly
I will wait 'til hell freezes over.  You gon' put me on your playlist
At one time, I had the underground in my hands
I let you have it for a sec—now I'm back in demand
No need to say my name—you already know who I am
And I'm rollin’ through your town like a horse into the city of Troy
All this fake thug shit got me really annoyed
You claim you a man, but in reality
Like Tom Hanks in that movie “Big,” you're really a boy
Give this kiddie a toy.  To you label distributors that fronted on my music
Eat a fat one, go sign the bullshit that's diluted
I'm back, like Freddie, with an LP—I hope you're ready
For Alkaline 'N' Acid—the combination's deadly

[Outro]
[Pumpkinhead]
Yeah, what I told you man?
Hehe, this album is crazy
Yo, matter of fact, I'mma stop, I'mma stop rhymin’
I'mma let my son spit

[*Raiden, Pumpkinhead's son, babbles for 13 seconds*]

[Pumpkinhead]
And that's better than half y'all niggas that's puttin’ records out right now
We serious right now, that's rainin’ right there
SoulSpazm, "Orange Moon Over Brooklyn," c'mon
