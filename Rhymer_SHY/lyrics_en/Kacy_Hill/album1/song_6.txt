[Verse 1]
Had this dream where a girl kissed your mouth
She had blue lips and I watched how you felt
Still, I could only love you
Remember that night
We were too stoned to drive
I panicked in the passenger side
The world felt like it slowed down

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'd like it if it slowed down with you

[Chorus]
My love, I would come through (come through)
And fall asleep with you
And you could love me the same (ooh)
You could love me the same (ooh)
You could love me the same

[Verse 2]
California doesn't smell like home
Like Arizona after warm thunderstorms
And I wish that I were there with you
Sometimes I picture my home against yours
'Til they meet up and my home becomes yours
'Cause I'd like to always be with you

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'd like it if you were there with me too

[Chorus]
And my love would be there
To fall asleep with you
And you could love me the same (ooh)
You could love me the same (ooh)
You could love me the same

[Outro]
You could love me the same
You could love me the same
