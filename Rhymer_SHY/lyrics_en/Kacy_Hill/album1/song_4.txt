[Verse 1]
I'm clarity, still holding on to light
Disguising clouds as cooler, grey sunshine
There's no surreal emotion
In swimming open oceans
I'm clarity in hesitating eyes

[Refrain]
Stripped down from all that's holy
With narcoleptic hoping
It's okay to look straight
Without naive impulsions

[Chorus]
Tonight
I'm fine
I'm clean
Not blind

[Verse 2]
It's temporary, resolving to rewind
Consuming silence 'til sound gives up the fight
Can't waste my nights on hoping
The world will give in slowly
It's temporary, these catatonic lights

[Refrain]
Stripped down from all that's holy
With narcoleptic hoping
It's okay to look straight
Without naive impulsions

[Chorus]
Tonight
I'm fine
I'm clean
Not blind

[Bridge]
I'm holding skies while waters rise
Watching the tides spill in with wine
Each day breaks a new space
To erase burdens you've been carrying

[Chorus]
Tonight
I'm fine
I'm clean
Not blind
