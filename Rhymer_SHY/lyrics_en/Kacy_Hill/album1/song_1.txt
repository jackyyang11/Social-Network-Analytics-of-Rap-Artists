[Verse 1]
Echoes of angels have cried
To tell me the church and your gates are not mine
Borrowed the tears from their pride
And man who neglects and makes woman a crime

[Pre-Chorus]
My love
Tell me the sky's not only for you
My love
Break me, I'm not made like you
My god
Save me

[Chorus]
Am I a crime? Crime? Crime?
Am I a crime? Crime? Crime?

[Verse 2]
This criminal heart that I've sown
Is born from the guilt of the limbs I adorn
Feminine breath met with scorn
Cannot bear the weight that impersonates yours

[Pre-Chorus]
My love
I'd give up my eyes to see like you
My love
Break me, I'm not made like you
My God
Save me

[Chorus]
Am I a crime? Crime? Crime?
From a woman's womb
Am I a crime? Crime? Crime?
From a woman's womb
From a woman's womb

[Bridge]
If I am the beast from temptation is born
Why can you not see the woman as more?

[Chorus]
Am I a crime? Crime? Crime?
From a woman's womb
Am I a crime? Crime? Crime?
From a woman's womb
From a woman's womb

[Outro]
From a woman's womb
From a woman's womb
