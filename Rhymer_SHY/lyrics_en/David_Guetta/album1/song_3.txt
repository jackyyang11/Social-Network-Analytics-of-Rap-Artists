I'm hurting deep inside
And it's like that always
The passion was not ours to keep
To keep...

The feelings justified
You're giving me this heartache
Rejection comes in and cuts so deep
So deep...

Now everywhere I turn
All my bridges burn
Why can't you see all I need come set me free

'Cause I still can feel you always
My love can heal you always
It too can heal you always
Alright, always

I still can feel it, always
I still believe it, always
I can't conceal it, always
All night, always

Everywhere I go
It's like you're there beside me
Possession makes my heart pretend
Pretend...

'Cause I just can't let go
What I did ever found me
To give affection once again
But to win

I feel I'm trapped inside
(I feel I'm trapped inside)
You've tooked all of my pride
Why can't you see all I need come set me free
I need come set me free

'Cause I still can feel you always
My love can heal you always
It too can heal you always
Alright, always

I still can feel it, always
I still believe it, always
I can't conceal it, always
All night, always
