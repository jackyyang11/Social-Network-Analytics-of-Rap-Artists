[Verse 1]
Let's go, leave everything and let's go
To a place where no one else can know
Let's run, let's hide
In a place that none will ever find

[Hook]
All I need is you baby, you
All I need is you baby
You're the only one I need
All I need is you baby, you
You're all I ever need

All I need is you baby
All I ever need is you baby
All I need is you baby
All I ever need is you baby
All I need is you baby
All I ever need is you baby
All I need is you baby
All I ever need is you baby
All I need is you baby
All I ever need is you baby
You and that infinte amount of love

[Verse 2]
Let's kill to be alive
Make sure there's nothin in between us, both you and I
Let's fly, up until the moment we die
Live in a mansion where there aren't any rooms to be shy

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Majestic confessions, the heart of the restless
When I look in to your eyes
Your flawless complexion just impacting my affection
Without you I'd die

[Outro]
All I need is you baby, you
All I need is you baby, you
All I need is you baby, you
All I need is you baby
You baby, you baby
You and your infinte amount of love
