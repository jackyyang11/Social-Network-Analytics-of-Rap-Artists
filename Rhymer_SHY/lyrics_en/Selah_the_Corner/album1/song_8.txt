[Verse 1 - Selah The Corner]
Never playin' when I say this ah yeah
Lookin' at the day with a praise I'm amazed that we got here
A whole lot a shame in the game tell the fame that we not here
A whole lot a pain in the game tell the rain that we out here
Uh they said that we never would see the day though
I see the sun raise of the day through the shade when I pray though
Life what I went through, that grave yard life could've been you
It's not that I can't see, I just see what the King do
Somebody take a bunch of rose pedals and throw'em over a stone tomb
Let the song play for the day make way to the throne room
Chariot those skies, peace to the war cries
Sight through the Lords eyes, hail to the Son rise

[Hook - Trini]
Sunrise sunrise sunrise sunrise
(Hail to the sunrise, hail to the sunrise)

[Verse 2 - Selah The Corner]
And something about this moment it's different I hope the people are listening
The King on a cloud with a trump loud and a big crown on glistening
And penny for your thoughts worth saving for any well that you wishin' in
Cause when you a Kings kid, the world what you fishin' in
Let'em hear the trump with harp and the sound of the tempo
I need to hear the lyre with the pipe and the crash of the cymbal
Chariot those skies, peace to the war cries
Sight through the Lords eyes, hail to the Son rise

[Hook]
