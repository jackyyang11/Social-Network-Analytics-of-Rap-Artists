[Hook]
Whoa sound of the chain gang
Working real hard for the same thing
Yep all for the same aim
Light up flame gang Christ up bang bang
Hold up dark all around
Homie get your glow up keep your eyes on the crown
So you never fold up get them hands in the sky
Just like it's a hold up chain gang on the fly

[Verse 1 - Selah The Corner]
I be on my gritty like a jersey on a running back
Yeah I'm from a city ponder realer where they thunder clap
City of the heart impact spiritual with metal
Where I revel joining more eye's in a sword then a thunder cat
My Savior is coming back got a problem air it out
Only read opinions to know what I shouldn't care about
Fronting rapper better sit rap is prostituting
Cause the flow they reproducing never celibate (click click)
The booth is looking like a monastery
For all my homies who won't need money it's commissary
Aye yo the policeman that I phone never that scary
Cause they don't care about a baby that a blackberry
But for my brothers on that color tip
Hold on homie you must not know what color my brother is
Look like a party then it gotta be
I need them hands up like it's a robbery

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Alex Faith]
Close like we connected at the hip
I'm so aggressive when I spit you know Atlanta never miss
Hoodie Season got that Selah bangin' in the whip
Pullin' up in that two door it's looking so legit
It's that New York south side connect
White boy gritty got a style you can respect
I'm laughing at these grown kids in the club raising they checks
Got that bottle service poppin' but that rich you did neglect
Uh this the sound of the chain gang
On the streets mobbin' where them boys tote them thang thangs
When you fed time at that state pen that county jail bump all of that
Got fam off in them brick walls and some of them ain't coming back
So we go hard in the paint yeah it's God who I thank
For keeping me from that foolishness when I was out there tryna play
Trappin' ain't cool cuz pimpin' ain't either
I'm a slave to His mercy ain't tryna escape neither

[Hook]
