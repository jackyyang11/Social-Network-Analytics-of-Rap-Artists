[Verse 1 - Rigz]
I'm hard like stone and cold like Steve Austin
The beat awesome you's a mark I'm the marksman
Bars in the drawers this large hit any target
A hundred yards off while it's moving and dodging
Lord I'm still viewing the coffins
Of orphans I walk past everyday that I'm talking
The gospel in these songs I never come off the porch with
Cause they say nobody cares till you endorse it
They say since fame Lecrae changed
I say when you grow your lane change
But they sayin' he became the same thing he played
When he made his name off of saying unashamed Bruce Wayne
Seen darker nights then Batman
Running from the ghost tryna eat like Pacman
Jesus the whole world needs us mold us
Kneed us up on high they need visas to see us
I got anonymous threats
Nah this ain't a punchline I really got threats
I replied with a smiley and I gave my address
Like please don't have me wait or I'm inviting myself
Cause I ain't with it and when it comes to lyrics yes I am the
Illest so much I am the sickest and my wife cried
On my bedside all the while getting visits
From the fans with some get well cards and best wishes
I spit it like survival of the fittest
I got verbs adverbs prepositions
Nouns for any person place or thing tryna get it
Cause I got metaphors meta-fives meta-sixes
I ain't in my right mind cause I'm in the
Left that's why I write with a right eye just wait for the
Right time Christ in a man let His light shine
So bright you only see my shadow at nighttime

[Verse 2 - Selah The Corner]
Real lit
Light higher homie and the fire still lit
Everybody run for cover when the real spit
And grown man bars what they gotta deal with
I've been in this game for years it made me a carnivore
Nah it's kinda making me vomit more
What I'm seeing on computer screen monitors
All of these Lionel Rich no Commodores
Just tellin' you the bare truth
Not really yo somebody gotta bare truth
Cause they ain't tryna multiply when they bare fruit
They be multiplying by they self no square roots
They probably got square roots
They be choking out the life like a bad weed
Why you guys spin tryna plant bad seed
We be tryna kill the track like a bad weave
Real spit
My day one dudes who the Corner still with
And they be talkin' 'bout another city real quick
But how you claim a hood you ain't ever build with
I'm a citizen of Y.O. BX Gunner rap
Brooklyn vet Shai Linne having none of that
Bump Christ down town where they move the hunter bags
Still stand behind QB like a running back
Gotta do better man
I hear brethren talking 'bout who better than
Still a rookie but I'm moving like a veteran
2016 like I'm two years ahead of them oh Lord
Gotta fix this
Cause gettin' money only thing that's on they wishlist
And Lord they be throwing bullets to the fullest until I return
Water in a sack like a pick six
Lot of rappers just wanna dance and have fun in the place
My target audience can't dance cause the gun on they waist
I got fam across seas that got hung for the faith
How many y'all will scream Christ with a gun in your face
Don't put me on your grid no more
It's cool you ain't gotta play me for your kids no more
But I'm a rep for King in the ring and shake up this rap
Pop homie till it don't fear us no more
