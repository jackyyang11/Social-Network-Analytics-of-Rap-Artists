[Hook]

Everything that I write is Anthemic
Bottles, models, stadiums wholesale
Drugs in a motel, 5 star hotel
Black white teeny boppers pulling at my coattails
Everything that I write is Anthemic
Molest, protest, face shot, no vest
Slums where poor rest, crack in the coat check
Drugs on the boat deck, 9 for the protect


[Verse 1]

People look at pain and they say wanna cry from it
Me I look at pain and I know that I’m alive from it
They lookin at the people starve never bat an eye from it
Hunger never bother em because they’ll never die from it…
Welcome to the famous, captain of your planet when they kissing on your anus, Someone get my Ferragamo slippers from the cleaners
She giving it up for free homey can you blame us
These the type of people that be killing off real life
Eating in your dreams have you starving in real life
I know a couple shorties really starving in real life
Being vain make you wanna cut with a real knife
Predators is at the playground in the vans beepin
Homeboys looking at the queen that his mans beatin
50 round drum make it fully automatic
Hit the block drop 40 you would think Drake and his mans beefin…
So I’m still in the cut
They half naked but they spiritual is still in the buff
And so I’m blowing up the prison and im stealing the cuffs
My only fear is that my enemies don’t fear me enough what!

We live in a society
That wants a lack of variety
They say work hard it’ll pay off
But how Craig getting fired on his day off
Some people ain't gon’ like you
Fame ain't nothing to give your life to
Malcolm x spoke about the future
But the only Malcolm seen is at the window with the rifle

[Hook]
[Outro]

We the people of Middle Earth
Refuse to remain sheep in this pasture they call the entertainment world
We no longer will aspire to be these buffoons and clowns that dance a jig and get a million followers
We don’t care about your money
We don’t care about your acclaim
We don’t care about those phone awards you win at those shows
Where are the awards for the fathers that stayed in their sons lives even though their fathers didn’t?
For the mother that worked 3 jobs instead of hitting that stripper pole to get through college
Where is the applause for that young black man who was the first one in his family to go to college?
Where is the applause for that young lady who actually waited until she got married to lose her virginity?
Where is the outrage that the only black men and women who ever get attention are the ones acting a fool?
We will acknowledge those who have excellence
We acknowledge those who stayed the course
We refuse to acknowledge those who bent the knee
Ever
And Flint Michigan still ain't got clean water!
