[Verse]

Reflecting on all of my lessons
Ask Jehovah if He happy with all my confessions
I’m kinda happy to be angry is never regression
And that I got to put away everything I’m repressing
Still lookin’ at them long stares
Wasn’t for the cross y’all be in my cross hairs
I had negative visions on how to deal with haters
4-5 switch in like Jordan vs the lakers
Still ghost writing for them rap titans
You know I never been the type to ever write and tell
But if you wondering why so and so is writing well
Try to correlate all of my stuntin’ with their album sales
Should give you a better picture of it
Cause you don’t care about the weather when you live above it
So when my mama lookin’ at me asking if I’m really rapping
Cause I move it and I do it and I really love it, I don’t remember
