[Verse 1 - Selah The Corner]
Big stage on a front page
A whole lotta fans at the mic stand
A whole lotta heads flying' in the clouds
That still floating when they flight land
Understand that we be on the ground though
Corner way they movin' the weight and lettin' them pound go
We communicating where the glory and the crown go
You saying grace abound but you ain't never around though
I bring the light where the dark play
But homie they be yearnin' for that nightlife
Instead of saying there's a brighter day
They bill boarding on another flight
I put God on another kite
Send it to the prison with this auditory vision I know
Don't talk about the war cause I go, I go, hold up

[Hook - J. Carter]
Tryin' to climb that ladder
Aiming for the throne
Claiming to build Your kingdom
But we really build our own
But we try to hide
Our intentions compromise
You deserve better than this

[Verse 2 - Selah The Corner]
Yo I'm just stating what the facts is
I see the world falling off it's axis
They leaning on they raps but they smellin' like a
Mark in a John homie tell me where the Acts is
Lookin' at the adversary tactics
Livin' in the death is still sharper then a cactus
Y'all be wanting followers downplaying the name
Dudes dyin' in the game and we talkin' 'bout practice
I leave the bodies sleep let the mind wake
Them bodies rotting from the beef like a bad steak
Jehovah be my rock and a judge so you know I run the
Rock down the court like a fastbreak
Gotta know that I'm riding for Christ's sake
And I represent Him in each and every bar that I flow
Don't talk about the war cause I go, and I know, hold up

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - J. Carter]
What have we become, we're done something wrong
Your people out here dying we're now numb to all their crying
Instead of us trying to convert, we just booked another concert
Save the ones You know in self, take the glory for ourselves
Don't think that we're exempt, really put ourselves in check
My life is Your it can't be kept, it's You alone You alone Jesus

[Hook]
