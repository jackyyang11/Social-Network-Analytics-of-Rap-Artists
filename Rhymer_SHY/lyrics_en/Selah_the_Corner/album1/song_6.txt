[Hook - Selah The Corner]
Catch me on the block Corner bodega
Eye on the clock 9-11 on the pager
Holla at the homies on the corner getting paper
Put 'em all on the the flavor of the maker

[Verse 1 - Seda]
You can call me the B-O-D-E-G-A
Four L-W, S-E-D-A
Follow the professor all day like a T.H
With more dance moves then Tye Tribbett and G.A
Sorta like a corner store I be the supplier
Everything you need plus the devil is a liar
Four part harmony and I don't need a choir
I just need the Son to keep me covered from the fire
I'm in this race like the tortoise and the hare
I'm the bride of Christ but we can all share
Cast your burdens and all of your cares
But it takes two and He is my pair
So I drop weight I'm really on the skinny tip
Flaws lay bare I'm really on the skinny dip
And yeah I'm rolling with the Nazarite
Taste and see the Lord is good have a bite

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Selah The Corner]
South sides the way oh rules in the trap
Stay cool if your black move with the mag
Gun smoke blocking they vision and cataract
And then it's only by the love of Jehovah they counteract it
And I'm tired of the racket my city is homicidal
And regardless of the death yo they sipping that macchiato
I done been to hell cause a bravado brother and follow
I ain't never going back like I'm Kobe in Colorado
He leading and I'm a follow the hit like Polamalu
I ain't talking to the guy that I'm comunicato
They shipping them keys like a piano the one
Never Keanu will be the one the true bridge

[Hook]
