[Verse 1]

The type of song that I don’t ever need a beat to write to
The type to make a hippie and Mahatma Ghandi fight you
The type to make you wait cause you ain't got the right to
Surrounded by the bars but your cellie never write you
I’m in the studio and Chris giving me lectures
Thats big bro I can't dismiss it as simple conjecture
He tellin me that my style is a felony
Wavy like a marina but I sound misdemeanor
Hold on, lets talk about that real life
That pray Jehovah get me over while I kneel life
That hit they body with shotty if they squeal life
That make a song about whatever thing I feel like, real life
I’m back to black ski mask
Back to the beat bodies im back to the rap repass
Before I let a peon play
He gotta debt homey he gon’ pay ole

[Hook: J. Carter]

The pressure
Weighing down on me
Things I did that I can't take back
All the time that I can't get back
Everything that you stole from me
Feeling alone with this anger inside
You can’t see life through my eyes
Got to let it go
Help me let it go
Its not about me

[Verse 2]

I wanted Redd to spit something you know he a legend
You yearn for that co sign if only for a second
And the fact I even know him is truly a blessing
Be he can't talk about what I'm confessing this a lesson
To the people that never knew better
This PK is a relay life
People always taking from you never repay life
So it’s a whole other animal when we say life
Imagine that, you a grown man although you a kid
Never alone cuz pops at home
But everybody always calling on your pops at home
To the point that you ain't feeling like your pops at home
Imagine that everybody gunning for your category
Nobody care about infringing on your territory
But you can understand God gotta get the glory
He can talk to you I ain't bothering him for a story
Me and my brother we cover each other
I see my mother suffer, I seen my pops cry
A lot people only family on Sundays
Can't afford true love so they rather cop lies
I seen pride try to kill the fold
I seen women turn bitter cause they gettin' old
I seen brothers who ain't never have mother
Turn they back on my mother for a nickel and a centerfold
But still the word go forth
It only matter that they eyes go north, and we can hold that torch
I love that the body is awaken back
But I wish that I could take em’ back real talk


[Hook]


[Outro Hook]

This my debt collection, I need a price correction
I’m paying back the man that’s looking in my own reflection
And tellin’ you the way it is how I show affection
This is life addressing, its what the mic addressing
This my debt collection, I need all of that
I’m repossessing if you got it then I want it back
They was running in my pockets they could crawl it back
I want all of that I need all of that
