Once we face the demons in ourselves
We understand how weak we were
It's not like they being inside us
More like we being inside them

If nothing seems to be fine
Let the light be your guide

Once you fall down
Again and again
And you got no one
But yourself to blame
It feels like the clock
Has stopped ticking
It feels like the world
Has stopped

You know, we've all
Been there before
The darkness inside
Begging for more
If nothing seems
To be fine
Let the light
Be your guide

We can't change ourselves
We are on our own
The least we can do now
Is to chase the light inside us
