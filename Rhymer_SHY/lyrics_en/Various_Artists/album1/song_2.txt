(If you don't want it)
(You got it)
(If you don't want it baby you go it) (Just watch the move)
I was in the 212
('Cause you got it, ah)
I was in the 212 (baby you got it ah)(Just watch the move)

Hey I can be the answer
I'm ready to dance when the vamp up
And when I hit that dip, get your camera
You could see I been that bitch since the Pamper
And that I am that young sis, the beacon
The bitch who wants to compete and
I could freak a 'fit, that pump with the peep and
You know what your bitch become when her weave in
I just wanna sip that punch with your peeps and
Sit in that lunch if you're treating

The move, the move, the move, the move, the move, the move
Break it down for me fellas

(The beginning of)
(If you want it) (I know how it feels) (break it down for me fellas)
(If you want it baby you got it) (just watch the move)
If you want it
You got it
If you want it baby you got it

Break it down for me fellas
