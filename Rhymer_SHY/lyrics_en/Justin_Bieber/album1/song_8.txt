[Verse 1]
Sitting here, all alone watching the snow fall
Looking back at the days when we threw them snow balls
I can't believe I'm putting the tree up by myself
I need you and nobody else

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm sorry if I pushed you away
Cause I need you here and I want for you to know

[Chorus]
And I don't care, if I don't get anything
All I need is you here right now
And I'm sorry if I hurt you
But I know that all I want is you
This Christmas, this Christmas, this Christmas
All I want is you this Christmas
I'm sorry if I hurt you but I know that
All I want is you this Christmas

[Verse 2]
And I never wanna do this alone
Baby I just need you to be here, here through the holidays, yeah
I just wanna know if you feel same way
Because I'm lonely baby, want you to hold me baby

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm sorry if I pushed you away
I just want you to know I miss you and I want you to stay

[Chorus]
And I don't care, if I don't get anything
Al I need is you here right now
And I'm sorry if I hurt you
But I know that all I want is you
This Christmas, this Christmas, this Christmas
All I want is you this Christmas
I'm sorry if I hurt you but I know that
All I want is you this Christmas

[Bridge]
Wrapping gifts without you babe's like mid-December
And there's no cold, I can't do this on my own
I've changed my ways
Keep running back and forth again, I'm here to stay, yeah

[Chorus]
And I don't care, if I don't get anything
All I need is you here right now
And I'm sorry if I hurt you
But I know that all I want is you
This Christmas, this Christmas, this Christmas
All I want is you this Christmas
I'm sorry if I hurt you but I know that
All I want is you this Christmas

[Outro]
All I want is you this Christmas
All I want is you this Christmas
