Said one, two, three, four, five
I just wanna, I just wanna spend the night
With you love
Oh you, love
Said one, two, three, four, five
I just wanna, I just wanna spend the night
With you love
Oh you love

Girl don't worry 'bout nothing
Nothing, nothing, nothing
Oh, when you used to worry about the little things
Girl don't worry 'bout nothing
Nothing, nothing, nothing

Babe, I'll take control
I'll hold you close to me, and I won't let you go
And I got your back, babe, and I won't let you go
I'll hold you close to me, and I won't let you go
