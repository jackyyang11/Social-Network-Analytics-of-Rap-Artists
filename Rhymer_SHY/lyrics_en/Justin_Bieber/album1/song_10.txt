[Intro]
Uh, uh, you know it, babe
Uh, uh, you know it, babe

[Verse 1]
Open up the door like a gentleman
Could you open up your heart and just let me in?
Tell me what you need and girl
I'll never ever disappoint you
And if you rock with me I could show you, babe
Ain't nobody gonna know you like I know you, babe
We could fly away, fly away
I adore ya

[Pre-Chorus]
Walking around with a little attitude
Short black skirt, the leather jacket too
How could I ever be mad at you?
I don't know, yeah
But I know all about your secrets
Cause you know that I can keep it
Baby why can't you see that
I'm yours

[Chorus]
I'm all yours, babe
I'm all yours, baby
I'm only yours, baby yeah

[Verse 1]
