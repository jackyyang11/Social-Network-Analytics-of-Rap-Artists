[Pre Hook]
Look
Everybody wanna piece, wanna piece
I fought with lions in the belly of the beast
I did things that would drive y'all to drink
I was thinking 'bout fucking on the sink
Got interrupted by the urgency to make cash
Ha, shit

[Hook]
I speak now, mother-motherfucka whiplash
Whiplash, my momma said it like
Aye, I gotta play the game so I can change the game
Shit, I gotta play the game so I can change the game
Lord, I gotta play the game so I can change the game
Game game, gotta play the game
Gotta play the game

[Verse 1]
Like aye, I gotta play the game so I can change the game
She want Balenciaga heels upon the frame
Ha, so deny her that is what I aim
But trying man will get it hotter than a frying pan
And I demand you come here with some rubber band a couple bands for mine too light
Ha, baby give it to me
I kinda want you to see
The realist you'll encounter any group category sub-genre
I'm honest and never pussy
Ha, these fools dying over looseleaf
Ha, I'ma be honest that I ain't too G
For a few G's or a few bees-dumb
I just view greed, but you seeing green thumbs
Aye whatchu growing?
My nigga whatchu growing?

Shit, I gotta play the game so I can change the game
Like aye, I gotta play the game so I can change the game
Shit, I gotta play the game
I Gotta play the game

[Verse 2]
Like yo, I gotta spend some change so I can get some change
Try me on night like Rihanna when she had the bangs
Smoking Cubana, rock designer, drive the newest Range
But aye my God that isn't everything
Yes, the realist niggas never make the claims
Ha, that the dollars that make
I'd rather take a pay-cut before I be a fake fuck
Needing your attention, do I need to mention that
Dollars burn, dreams don't?
You switching teams, why bo?
You can be aware and still fly
Whether or not, you gon lose a lot but what do I know?
What do I know?
What do I know?
Shit, I don't even know
But that shit don't make you blow like

[Pre Hook]
Everybody wanna piece, wanna piece
I fought with lions in the belly of the beast
I did things that would drive y'all to drink
And I was thinking 'bout fucking on the sink
Got interrupted by the urgency to make cash
Ha shit

[Hook]
I speak now, mother-motherfucka whiplash
Whiplash, my momma said it like
Aye, I gotta play the game so I can change the game
Shit, I gotta play the game so I can change the game
