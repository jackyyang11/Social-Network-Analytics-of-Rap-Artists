[Intro: Kool A.D.]
Kinda cold and I'm with someone (na na na na na)
Here we go now na na na na
There ain't nothing you can do about it
(na na na na)
Know I knew you were the one for me (na na na na)
Never mind, never mind, never mind

[Verse 1: Kool A.D.]
Why eat chocolate candy? type profit dandy type
We wrote this on a tandem bike
On Mount Tam with a random dyke
Masculine feminine sandal like
See my writs on DatPiff
I spit jazz by candle light, I'm a beast
Victor Vasquez man you might like
How I stand on a land at night and day
Transitional light, period is right
Weird little shits for beardy kids and 20 year bids
First time offenders who feel like their lives ended
Only to start again too late
I'm about love I don't do hate
I don't want to write this down
I just want to tell you how I feel right now
I don't want to write this down na na now now

[Verse 2: SAFE]
Left the park now, I feel like a spaceship
Coolest night of the year, but they taste it
Mama asleep, but the front door is silent
You can rub the nigga and I love the violets
Leave them as struck as me and I love the violence
Snort alone and you see me just cryin'
Stand still, atrophy is a violence
Crush the pill, a trophy is violence
Little child doesn't know how to light it
Kiss her ring, kiss her finger cause I'm tryin'
Slap my face, hold me down, grab me wrist
Cuban links, Cuban links, Cuban links
Years later, you still hurt me badly
But, I never hit her, she hurt me badly
I'm trying to leave here, but I couldn't see away, away

[Outro: Toro Y Moi]
You and me got two weeks, gotta make it worth while
Gotta make the day long, look at how much we work
You and me got two weeks, gotta make it worth while
Gotta make the day long, look at how much we work
