Wait. She can only be with me
I know... she's my true love
I've got...to keep this straight...now
Never seen myself this way:
The man she needs in her life
I've got to keep this right

Follow her tonight, to give
What she looking for, she looking for, she looking for
Cause she's all alone, she's all alone, she's all alone, she's all alone

Follow her tonight, to give
What she looking for, she looking for, she looking for
Cause she's all alone, she's all alone, she's all alone, she's all alone

All alone
All alone
All alone
All alone

Wait. She can only be with me
I know... she's my true love
I've got...to keep this straight...now
Never seen myself this way:
The man she needs in her life
I've got to keep this right

All alone
All alone
All alone

Follow her tonight, to give
What she looking for, she looking for, she looking for
Cause she's all alone, she's all alone, she's all alone, she's all alone

Follow her tonight, to give
What she looking for, she looking for, she looking for
Cause she's all alone, she's all alone, she's all alone, she's all alone

All alone
All alone
All alone

All alone
All alone
All alone
