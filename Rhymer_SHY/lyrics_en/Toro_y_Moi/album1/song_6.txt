[Ambient Rainbow Sounds][?]

What do you want from me, I can't help you out
Take what you need from me, and get out, get out

What do you think about, when I sing to you, to let it go
What do you see in your mind, when I say to let it go, let it go

I can go twice as high, butterfly in the sky (x4)

What do you see in your mind, when i say to let it go, let it go
What do you think about when i sing to you, to let it go
What do you see in your mind, when i say to let it go, let it go
