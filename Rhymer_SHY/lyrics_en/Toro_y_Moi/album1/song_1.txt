[Chorus]
And I know there's no reason
Why does there have to be?
And I know there's no answer
When I call don't pick up

[Verse]
It's coming now
It's got me laughing
I'm on the floor

No guessing now
I'm in the corner
I can't get up

Don't call me back
Don't get me laughing
I can't shut up

[Chorus]
I know there's no reason
Why does there have to be?
I know there's no answer
When I call don't hang up
