I know you wanted me to be more like that
But did you know why
But did you know why

I know you wanted me to be more like that
But did you know why
But did you know why

I Couldn't go forever
If I planned it
If I wanted
But it's too much to make
Too much to own
To take and to claim

What's in your mind
What's in your mind
What's in your mind
What's in your mind
What's in your mind
What's in your mind
What's in your mind
What's in your mind

You keep on telling on me to watch the way I talk
But did you know why
But did you know why

But I have never asked you for all your advice
But did you know why
But did you know why
