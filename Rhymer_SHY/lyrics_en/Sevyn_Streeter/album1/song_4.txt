I should've I never offered it
But he made me feel like this could be forever
Never thought he gon run off with it
But that don’t make it no better

(Verse)
He used to hit me least 4 times a day
Til he got what he wanted
Caught me by surprise
I never saw it coming

(Bridge)
Walls fell down and up
There goes my pride
Guards shattered
Now I realized…

(Pre-Hook)
I should’ve used protection
Instead of moving so fast
But I’m a sucker for affection
Shoulda never showed you that

And now I got myself to blame why did I let you come in
I shouldn’t gave my heart away but I trusted you with it

(Hook – part 1)
Niggas be on that bullshit
Having us looking foolish
Can't keep lettin' em do this
Bitch ass niggas

(Hook – part 2)
One minute call us baby
Next minute call us crazy
Niggas be on that bullshit
Bitch ass niggas

(Verse)
And you’ll say it’s all in my head
It’s all in my head
It’s all in my head
So ignore my intuition and
Believe every word that you said

(Bridge)
Walls fell down and up
There goes my pride
Guards shattered
Now I realized…

(Pre-Hook)
I should’ve used protection
Instead of moving so fast
But I’m a sucker for affection
Shoulda never showed you that

And now I got myself to blame why did I let you come in
I shouldn’t gave my heart away but I trusted you with it

(Hook – part 1)
Niggas be on that bullshit
Having us looking foolish
Can't keep lettin' em do this
Bitch ass niggas

(Hook – part 2)
One minute call us baby
Next minute call us crazy
Niggas be on that bullshit
Bitch ass niggas

Niggas be on that bullshit
Acting like they don’t do shit
Do shit, do shit
What the fuck? I look stupid?

But it’s the way that you made me
And it’s the way we bangin
And you all on it, all on it
Like you see another pimp on yo lady

And I feel
Like you just a waste of time forever
Yea, that’s that true shit
Oh, and I won’t ever come tumbling down

(Pre-Hook)
I should’ve used protection
Instead of moving so fast
But I’m a sucker for affection
Shoulda never showed you that

And now I got myself to blame why did I let you come in
I shouldn’t gave my heart away but I trusted you with it

(Hook – part 1)
Niggas be on that bullshit
Having us looking foolish
Can't keep lettin' em do this
Bitch ass niggas

(Hook – part 2)
One minute call us baby
Next minute call us crazy
Niggas be on that bullshit
Bitch ass niggas

Bitch ass niggas
All these bitch ass niggas
That true shit
Niggas be on that bullshit
