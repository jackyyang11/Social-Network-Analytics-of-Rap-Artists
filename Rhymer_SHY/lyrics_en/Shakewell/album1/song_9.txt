[Verse 1: Fat Nick]
Finessin' the streets, I gon' pull out my heat
Man this lean all on me, triple six into me
Never loved a bitch, [?]
Juggin', hit my line for a pint, gotta flip
Sip slow, get low, choppa out the window
Three hollow tips gon' hit him like timbo
Pussy bitch flaunder, hit the land for a kick though
Percocet poppin', I gon' eat the pussy slow-mo
Oh she love me, oh she want me
Stupid ass bih, hit that dope "C'est la vie !" (That's life!)
Block pumped, heat tucked, I don't give two fucks
Kickstand on it, got me sippin' till I'm dead slumped
Talkin' 'bout money boy, now I gotta know
Yo shows ain't doin' numbers and your whole clique blows
Empty out that clip, turn that pussy boy cold
Know you ain't really 'bout it, man I thought you been towed, skrrt

[Hook: Shakewell]
So I switch lanes on you, bitch
Bet you can't hang with the shits
Never make no change on my shit
'Cause I never sign my name to your list
So I switch lanes on you, bitch
Bet you can't hang with the shits
Never make no change on my shit
'Cause I never sign my name to you
Bet you can't hang with the shits
Never make no change on my shit
'Cause I never sign my name to you

[Verse 2: Shakewell]
Picture the image I paint
As she keep rollin' the dank, she was suckin' for love of the shade
The dragon she handle, but ain't speak the language of Saints
So I do her for fool and the shark took the bait
Now I'm in love with the fates, rollin' trip sixes
It's all but the sixes, when hittin' the stage in your state
Stick 'em and leave 'em to stank
Live by the sword, he gon' die by the shank
Give a fuck if a [?] signs up to your label
No names, no politicians politickin' 'bout they business
Open the scroll, that's my gang
Now to be made, as I switch lanes
Watch as I gain from bein' independent, better than impressive
Serve her presses, stealin' checks from you if you a lame
Slave to the game, it's a god damn shame
How you sold out your own fuckin' boy for some change

[Outro: Shakewell]
So I switch lanes on you, bitch
Bet you can't hang with the shits
Never make no change on my shit
'Cause I never sign my name to your list
So I switch lanes on you, bitch
Bet you can't hang with the shits
Never make no change on my shit
'Cause I never sign my name to you
