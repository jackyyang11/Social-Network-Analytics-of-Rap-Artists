[Hook: Shakewell]
Boy was born with the sauce, I just might die by the juice
Got a 8 in a liter, I dropped some percs in it too
God bless my killas in Mexico who be packin' the tool
They leave you headless and bloody, it don't even make the news
I woke up and hit the blunt and kicked the perc back in
I pour up, check my account, and get the work back in
I moved up, I'm just a scrub who got the street locked in
I re-up, just for my block, so now we all clock in

[Verse 1: Shakewell]
Cartier 'penny, hunnid blue faces
Retrosuperfuture, Gucci flyin' stupid crazy
Been a bar baby, lean sippin' lazy
245 for this Ruger 380
80 for the guap, you a fuckin' cop
I ain't finna spit no game to no fuckin' thot
Ain't no shame up in my game, it's Shameless Money Guap
SMG and GMC, I hit my voodoo walk
I been a man who droppin' jam up in my soda pop
You be the man up in the [?]
Can't do the Quali, pour the Tech and Wock, it's all I got
You think you say that purple Karo syrup do the job
