[Hook x2]
All that I wanted was packs, flip 'em, make it back
All of it came with some beef, bitch I'm a thug, got a Glock in my sheets

[Verse 1]
All that I wanted was packs, cop 'em, hit the trap
Flip 'em, make it back
Come with the cash or get whipped by the strap
Pretendin' you know me, you snitched on the homie
I'm smokin' this OG, that 40 thang on me
I don't even use it, my shank I'm abusin'
This easy to me while you so damn confusin'
Police just pulled up so I guess I elude 'em
Police just pulled up and he ain't scared to use 'em
We servin' the syrup by remixin', you use it
There's too many bitches and you still be choosin'
Four or five more bars 'till I finish this song
Only four bars 'till I flipped the whole jar
Made a few K, need a gun on my waist
Whippin' up 13K 'till I get like Erase

[Hook x2]
All that I wanted was packs, flip 'em, make it back
All of it came with some beef, bitch I'm a thug, got a Glock in my sheets

[Verse 2]
Glock in my sheets
If I see the police, I'ma duck the police
If they get you homie, please don't speak
I know where you stay and my killas creep
Been rollin' these blunts up since I was a youngin' so they don't leak
Can't pick up the pieces, let's pick up the packs
If they start shootin', our bullets pollutin'
Pick up the pieces and pick up the 'shraps
Missin' my homies who missin', still knowin' that they can come back
If you on a mission, make sure that you hit 'em
Get all the work and make sure you come back
All of this grindin', it came with some gold
Fuck me some hoes and I play me some shows
All of this love, yeah it came with some hate
All of these clips came with one in the 'chamb

[Hook x2]
All that I wanted was packs, flip 'em, back it back
All of it came with some beef, bitch I'm a thug, got a Glock in my sheets
