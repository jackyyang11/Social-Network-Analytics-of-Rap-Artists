[Hook x2]
She don't really love me, no, but she gon' hold me down
If I up this 40, it might slip out 30 rounds
Shooters move in silence, dead before shells hit the ground
Homie off the needle, these 30s, they keep me down

[Verse 1]
I just hope they prayin' for me lately, 'cause I need that
He can't tell me nothin, bitch, I don't want hear no feedback
I was off them xannies for three months, until I relapsed
I ain't sip no drank for 'bout a month, but now I be back
Up on all my bullshit, so the one you know you love to hate
Now that I been poppin', all my shows feelin' like holidays
All this on my mind, all the time is gone, rest in peace, Erase
Why the good die young, it don't make sense, it ain't gon' be the same
Locked up me in band, be for some bullshit, but we beat the case
[?] held us down, like an OG, never said the name
Even posted bond, that's a bond that no one could ever break
Lawyer talkin' for me, tell the judge he can't even see my face

[Hook x2]
She don't really love me, no, but she gon' hold me down
If I up this 40, it might slip out 30 rounds
Shooters move in silence, dead before shells hit the ground
Homie off the needle, these 30s, they keep me down
