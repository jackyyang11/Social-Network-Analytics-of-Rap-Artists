[Hook x2]
The codeine it calm me down
I can't feel my body now
I got the xans now
Feel like the man now
Think I might tour in Japan now

[Verse 1]
Too many bands now
Glock in the jeans let me pull up my pants now
Bitches from France now
Wondering how I went from a dub to some grands now
Pull up and smash out
My body keep dropping now
Bitches on top me now
Call me somebody's now
Ain't nothing change I'm still the same game
Now since I get paid for the plays now
Used to take Greyhounds
Searching for change now
We cut the whole thing now
They pay for my planes now
Just beat the case
Not tripping not wondering how
I'm thinking I love me now
But hoes [?] not looking down
Before you start thinking we cooling homies
Let me just keep it real ain't no hand outs homie
Its five for the feature homie
Feel like Kyrie I don't need new homies
Still putting on for my city homie
Got some boulders on shoulders I carry on me
Still keep the percs on my Faygo
Still trapping on the lay low
Migos round me with a queso
Can't call my youngin down in my town what they going to say tho
Hit em Canseco

[Hook x3]
The codeine it calm me down
I can't feel my body now
I got the xans now
Feel like the man now
Think I might tour in Japan now

[Outro]
The codeine it calm me down
I can't feel my body now
I can't feel my body now
I can't feel my body
I can't feel my body now
