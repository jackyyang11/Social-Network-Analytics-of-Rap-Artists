[Hook]
Been pourin the Wock up, it all that I needed
Lil shorty bad and conceited
Bitch I'm the plug, don't ask what I need
I pick the nugs out the tree
I keep a Glock in my handbag
Ain't kick the cup, where my drank at?
Pack it up, I can ship it to you
Be the bakerman, keep a dozen Ruger
Been pourin the Wock up, it all that I needed
Lil shorty bad and conceited
Bitch I'm the plug, don't ask what I need
I pick the nugs out the tree
I keep a Glock in my handbag
Ain't kick the cup, where my drank at?
Pack it up, I can ship it to you
Be the bakerman, keep a dozen Ruger

[Verse 1]
Save me the eighth of the indoor
I just keep movin' ten packs of the outdoor
Why you keep askin' what an ounce for?
If you don't know don't know me don't call on my trap door
Not once a month, bitch that's every week
Choppers 'gon play, then I let it scream
Spend my green hunnids, got blues on me
I need a plug on some good OG
Send me the play, that's a good key
I just hit a lick, four hunnid and I'm still lookin'
Hunnid off rap and I'm still juggin'
Fam gotta eat, in the kitchen, so I'm still cookin'
Not once a month, bitch that's every day
XD and Glock .40, let it spray
Kudos gon' run 'em down, broad day
Have Gun - Will Travel, any state
I keep propane on me, Hank Hill
Shameless money, movin' all them pain pills
I pop a 30, got pain still
Shooters hangin', bangin' out the windowsill
Don't say no name, if you do you get shanked
Snitches and triflin' hoes, shit that I hate
Hoes and them thots, that's that shit that I love
Slow walk in the bank, I be off all them drugs
