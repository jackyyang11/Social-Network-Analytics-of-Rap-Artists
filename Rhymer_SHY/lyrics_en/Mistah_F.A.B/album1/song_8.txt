[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Woke up quick at about noon
Realized that I had to be on market soon
I gotta get rich fo' my day begins
Cause I don't want complaining about my ends
Walked out the house damn near went blind
Young niggas on the block throwing up turf signs
I went in the house and grabbed my clip
The MAK-90 put it on my hip
Pointed my guns in a sucka's direction
And just like I thought them niggas kept on steppin'
I jumped on the phone, hopped in the ride
Sittin' on 30's kinda high
Then I let the Alpines play
Some old school 415 from the Bay
It was Side Show
And Groupie Ass Bitch
And until this day
Nobody fucking with Rich

I'm cruising down the street in my Mazi fo' do'
Never jocking a bitch or sweating a ho
Pulled to the park to get to school
Knuckleheads outside straight shooting hoops
Me and Teej pulled up who can it be
A youngster said "Man, that's F.A.B."
Another car pulled up and what did he say
I know you ain't get that off GTA
Hey look, them boys and the ice is always sauce
And when we pull up, you know we gon' floss
It's nothin to buy it, whatever it costs
We shop at Neiman Marcus we don't shop at Ross

[Outro]
