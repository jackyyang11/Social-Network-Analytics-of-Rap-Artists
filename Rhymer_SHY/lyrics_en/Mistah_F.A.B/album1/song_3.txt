[Verse 1: Mistah FAB]
Pray for Paris, what they tell us, while Nigeria burn
Schools bombed overseas, where kids in Syria learn
Islamic leaders being attacked for political reasons
US spies kidnapped and found guilty of treason
Missles getting tested, America getting ready for war
Meanwhile children in the ghetto gotta sleep on the floor
Cause rival gangs shooting guns with no aim at all
Police be racial profiling, tryna blame us all
And with Obama out of office, ain't no hope for the blacks
2016, can you still believe they smoking on crack?
Bigger than rap, let's just take a second to focus on facts
50% of minorities in jail and most of 'em black
Black lives matter, yeah right, that's just a hoax and an act
Rest in peace to the Jack, hate I had to say that
Thought it was just in my city 'til I cut on the news
It's happening all around the world, Keyshia tell 'em the truth

[Hook: Keyshia Cole]
Children dying, mother's crying, no one cares, oh it isn't fair
I thought it was just in my hood but I cut on the news
Everybody's hiding, everybody's crying
This world war, it ain't just in my hood

[Verse 2: Mistah FAB]
Oh so you can't see? What, you got on a blindfold?
Too busy in your Benz tryna dodge them potholes
Don't know what's going on in the streets of Chicago
Lil boy killed in an alley, reason why? Only God knows
Young boys high, putting coke in their nostrils
It's a race of babies that hate the ladies
Must have thought it was a lie when you heard it in Pac's song
His mama strung out and you know that his pops gone
The preacher can't reach 'em, he ain't hearing the gospel
Future on his iPhone, this shit is colossal
Christians lost acting like they really know where Christ is
World War 3 coming soon with ISIS
Shoe boxes full of letters, all my homies is lifers
Not just in my hood, from San Quentin to Rikers
Thought it was just in my city 'til I cut on the news
It's happening all around the world, Keyshia tell 'em the truth

[Hook: Keyshia Cole]
Children dying, mother's crying, no one cares, oh it isn't fair
I thought it was just in my hood but I cut on the news
Everybody's hiding, everybody's crying
This world war, it ain't just in my hood

[Verse 3: Mistah FAB]
Black America wake up, we was asleep for too long
Got me feeling like Marvin Gaye, what's going on?
Treyvon down in Florida, to Mike in Ferguson
The next Malcolm or Martin, look, they probably done murdered them
Church shooters get arrested and brought in like company
Oscar shot in his back and Sandra died in custody
KKK get exposed, all members of congress
Russia blame terrorism on known jihadists
While all these rappers argue 'bout who is the hottest
I'm tryna teach my daughter, she's an African goddess
The Real Isis was a goddess, not a terrorist group
Make all our good seem bad without telling the truth
Flip all our signs and our symbols that resemble the love
Turning to hate groups, mentally be messing us up
Thought it was just in my city 'til I cut on the news
It's happening all around the world, Keyshia tell 'em the truth

[Hook: Keyshia Cole]
Children dying, mother's crying, no one cares, oh it isn't fair
I thought it was just in my hood but I cut on the news
Everybody's hiding, everybody's crying
This world war, it ain't just in my hood
