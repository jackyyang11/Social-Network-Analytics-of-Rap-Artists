[Hook: Dyson]
Not a familiar face in years
Guess they forgot to remember me
And why is granny the only one answers
Auntie died, momma sick and she got cancer
My best friend sleeping with my B.M
My old block dying cause they beefing
I cry until the sunrise
Praying for these bars to break

[Verse 1: Mistah F.A.B.]
Dear little bruh
I'm writing to see if you got my last letter
And if you did honestly this my last letter
I get the point, I see you to busy and don't wanna be bothered
It's just just weird how we share the same mother and father
But yet you treat me like a stranger, instead of your brother
How could you hate me so much, when you know that I love ya
I didn't choose this life bruh, I was forced in it
Married to the game and couldn't get a divorce in it
No prenup with me it was all or nothin'
I did all the hustlin' I was tired of strugglin'
I got addicted to that cash money, quick, quick, cash money
Dad was on dope , he ain't have bus pass money
Moms was in the streets hoein' for gas money
I was on the corner thuggin', chasin' that fast money
Whatchu wanted me to do?
I never had intentions little bruh on leaving you
The streets was the only thing there that would feed me dude
My life was hard bruh, it wasn't easy dude
I ain't had that type of life that you see on T.V. dude
I just wasn't ready for the streets when they freed me dude
I was chasin' my past hangin' 'round with sleazy dudes
I was doing things the normal man wouldn't even do
I just want you to come and see me dude
I just want you to come and see me dude

Everyday this what I see when I awake in this cell
I spend 23 hours of the day in this cell
Gotta sleep, gotta shit, gotta pray in this cell
Gotta eat, gotta piss, gotta lay in a cell
All night, all morning, all day in this cell
Prison on lock down, gotta stay in this cell
Think about my old bitch, masturbate in this cell
Couple books help my mind elevate in this cell
So much frustration feel my hate in this cell [?]
No love at all, man I'm hatin' this cell
Can't go no where, man gotta wait in this cell
Contemplated suicide, man by a shank in this cell
Drag queens that you probably never think was a male
Fags, punks, snitches, man be racin' to tell
Undercover homos be chasin' the tail
Grown men cryin', getting raped in they cell
Killers on the streets, man [?]
Cellie been dead a week, no escapin' the smell
No letters in 5 years, lost faith in the mail
It's only so much you can take 'fore you yell
It's only so much you can take as a male
It's only so much you can take in this hell

Dear big bruh
Yeah I got all your letters
I responded several times, just didn't have the courage to send them
And nah I don't treat you man like you a stranger
But I can't lie its hard to bottle up all this anger
When you first came home, we had plans to change the game up
When you got out it's like damn you changed up
I was thinking we can be like Baby and Slim
Me and you, we can take over the game and get this win
All I needed man was your patience for you to believe
But you was more interested in the streets then believin' in me So why you wonder why I'm mad and why I don't reach back You let me down so many times doin' all that
Hurt my heart to find out, man that you were smoking on crack
Cause I was like nah man, my brother wouldn't do that
But you did bro, looked up to you since a kid bro
Don't matter whatever it is you still is my big bro
But them drugs had your mind gone
And that plus blind jealousy had you looking at me like I'm wrong
Decisions you was making in the streets wasn't wise ones
And the things that you said could've jeopardized lives bruh You was only worried about yours wasn't worried about mine bruh
But you being locked up who you think was easy to find bruh[?]
Your niece getting old, she about to turn 9 bruh
Daddy had AIDS, I sat and watched him die bruh
Momma had cancer, I sat and watched her die bruh
12 years I waited for you, a lot of time bruh
For you to get out and go back and do time bruh
That's why I ain't fucking with you
I ain't wasting my time bruh
But I love you man, I really do
And as I get older I feel sorry for you
But you weren't worried about niggas tryna kill me
What will be, will be, when it will be
This is only how I feel, I just hope you feel me
This is only how I feel, I just hope you feel me
