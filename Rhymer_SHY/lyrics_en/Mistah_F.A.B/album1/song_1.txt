[Intro]
To my Black and Latino brothers, we'll continue fighting and killing each other where on the [?] on the planet they have set up for us. We can never say that America has filled us cause America has never been set up for us to win. We must stand in solitary and fight together. If you look in a prison theirs more of us than them. You must continue to understand, it's us against them. 6 shots.

[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning and on TV saw a man murdered
Selling CD’s in front the store to get his fam further
Six shots to the chest in front of everybody
Dead on arrival, last breathe seen it out his body
His kids mama made a speech, that shit made me weak
He son broke down crying live on TV
Later on that day seen a man get shot on a traffic stop
White America, when will this madness stop?
Same situation, black victim, white cop
Same scenario, six months later case dropped
I think it's all apart a plan to start a civil war
Then implement martial arts, they knocking down our doors
This shit happen in the ghetto, mainly cause we poor
What make it worse is man it happened before we grow
They say all cops ain't bad well shit I can't tell
Cause every time I turn around they kill a black male

[Hook]
It's a war outside nobody safe from
Try to play with our minds, but we ain't dumb
This a war outside that nobody safe from
Try to play with our minds, but we ain't dumb
Mr. Officer, Mr. Officer
Death and jail the only thing they offer us
Mr. Officer, Mr. Officer
I can't breath, take these damn cuffs off of us

[Verse 2]
A gorilla get killed these white folks ask
A black man killed, ain't nobody mad
Choked Eric Garner out, he selling cig's
Broke Freddie Gray back, yep they sure did
Don't know what happen to Sandra, but man it ain't cool
Try to say suicide, think we damn fools?
Shot Oscar in the back, he was handcuffed
Didn't even give Tamir enough time to put his hands up
And Jesse Williams told ya'll so what you [?]
You still a nigga, even in the latest name brands
You pick cotton for the master as a chained man
Now you pick cotton for fashion, it's the same man
So for all you white folks that say we all equal
I bet you wouldn't trade pigmentation with my people
Everybody wan't to be a nigga 'til you gotta be a nigga
Until your son is the one dead from a trigger

[Hook]
It's a war outside nobody safe from
Try to play with our minds, but we ain't dumb
This a war outside that nobody safe from
Try to play with our minds, but we ain't dumb
Mr. Officer, Mr. Officer
Death and jail the only thing they offer us
Mr. Officer, Mr. Officer
I can't breath, take these damn cuffs off of us

[Verse 3]
This shit ain't nothing new, Blacks been getting hung
Just with no iPhones recording, with no Samsungs
Been castrating Black men cause our dicks bigger
Coward ass white boy still scared of niggas
Want us to talk it out, want us to keep quiet
Laugh cause it's our own shit we burn when we riot
Let's start hitting their communities and let's see what happen
Set fire to their brand new Benz, Ferrari's, and mansion
I bet the National Guard be on the scene quick
Guilty white boys in badges so we call 'em pigs
What got me hot is that no black cops speaking out
Could've been your son, could've been your daughter out there bleeding out
Tell me what good is having arms if you ain't reaching out
Tell me what good is having a tongue if you ain't speaking out
You see it's power in the people that they don't speak about
You see the power of the people is what I speak about

[Hook]
It's a war outside nobody safe from
Try to play with our minds, but we ain't dumb
This a war outside that nobody safe from
Try to play with our minds, but we ain't dumb
Mr. Officer, Mr. Officer
Death and jail the only thing they offer us
Mr. Officer, Mr. Officer
I can't breath, take these damn cuffs off of us

[Interlude]
I wear that blue uniform proudly, but what hurts me is the most is the people that stood there front and stood in front of the mayor and said "I swear to oath that I will serve and protect this community." I'm here because I wanted to make a difference, but how dare you sit next to me in the same uniform and murder somebody. How dare you? You oughta be a shamed of your self. So why don't we just keep it real here, if you're that officer then know good in well you got [?] complex. You're afraid of people don't look like you. You have no business in that uniform. If you are to go talk to an African American female or male, or a Mexican male or female because their not white like like you, take the uniform off. You have no business being a police officer. If you're that's [?] take the uniform and put the KKK hoodie on
