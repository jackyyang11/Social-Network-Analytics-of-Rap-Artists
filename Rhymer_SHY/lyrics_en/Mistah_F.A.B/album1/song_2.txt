[Intro]
Yeah Fresh what up
Damn it’s the only shit that happen all this time
How long
10 years later

[Verse 1]
The fans ask me all the time I just hope that they listen
What’s my real outlook on love and religion
I’m not a Muslim not a Catholic and I sure ain’t a Christian
I live life through perception and I’m sharing my vision
Don’t even know if there’s a God I ain’t focused on that
When I was young moms and dad was smoking on crack
But from the bottom of the pearl Oakland exact
Made it out the hill man made Heaven of that
Call me a sinner or a saint atheist or a devil
I’m a soldier of life running hard like a rebel
Meek told yall man to this shit there would be levels
I just hope you hear the beat fresh turn up the treble
I do good for the hood always giving back
And never would forget where I was living at
In the ghetto with the government that give us straps
So we could kill each other going tit for tat

[Hook]
I lost everyone I love and I’m all alone
God bless a child that could hold his own
Still on the corner get my money on
Hurting inside still be like nothing wrong
My momma dead and my daddy gone
My brother locked up and he ain’t coming home
Posted on the corner get my money on
Me and Sway deeper than a rap song

[Verse 2]
My daughter steady getting older and it’s tripping me out
She said daddy don’t call me Libby it’s Liberty now
I just laughed shaked my head she remind me of me
The little boy in my heart wish my mommy could see
I act tough but on the inside I’m breaking to pieces
Plus losing all my homies keep making me weaker
This year alone I lost ten and it’s only March
Music only thing that help my lonely heart
My baby momma moved on look I’m proud of you A
I’m sorry for the shit I put you through that’s all I could say
All the lying and the cheating gon catch up in Karma
I’m preparing myself now protecting the armor
Broke so many damn hearts waiting for mine to be broke
On 45
And Market steady grinding the dope
Posted up strapped up with a nine in my coat
Cause anny nigga that step out of line getting smoked

[Hook]
I lost everyone I love and I’m all alone
God bless a child that could hold his own
Still on the corner get my money on
Hurting inside still be like nothing wrong
My momma dead and my daddy gone
My brother locked up and he ain’t coming home
Posted on the corner get my money on
Me and Sway deeper than a rap song

[Verse 3]
I came back so many times folks counted me out
My biggest motivation had to be what others would doubt
I kept secrets held water man what others would snitch
I’d rather starve with the real than be fake with the rich
Never hate wait your turn everyone get a pick
It’s like waiting in a line everyone get a flick
Nightmares of being broke steady haunt me at night
To help me sleep through the pain put a phone to sprite
Worth a while while things just trying to stay sane
Watch my momma die shit still fuck with my brain
Watch my best friend in rap catch one in the brain
Brother got a hundred years yeah he locked in them chains
I never lie in my rap I feel that is lame
Prolly never sell a million but I’m balling the same
I take a millionaire bitch cause it’s all in the game
Rest in peace to the Jacks still calling my name

[Hook]
I lost everyone I love and I’m all alone
God bless a child that could hold his own
Still on the corner get my money on
Hurting inside still be like nothing wrong
My momma dead and my daddy gone
My brother locked up and he ain’t coming home
Posted on the corner get my money on
Me and Sway deeper than a rap song

[Outro]
Fresh ten years later and it seem like we ain’t stop doing this shit man
See the difference me and these other niggas is man these nigga’s be trying to exaggerate they lifestyle
Everything I talk about is my real life man you don’t hear me talking about killing niggas
You hear me talking about selling dope niggas it’s dope here
Tonight show original let’s do it yeah
