[Verse 1]
We might have danced all night
And we might have made out to this song, I can't remember
Yeah my dream was pretty strong
And your loving's got me out of control

[Chorus]
Cause you got my heart around your finger
And it's so obvious, I cannot keep my cool
When we touch, you let it linger
I gotta sleep all day cause I know me and you
Will be up all night
Up all night
If you love me right
All night

[Verse 2]
Rip your shirt apart, all our clothes are coming off
Dirty mind, on the dance floor
I don't know why I am this way
But I just can't behave around you

[Chorus]
Cause you got my heart around your finger
And it's so obvious, I cannot keep my cool
When we touch, you let it linger
I gotta sleep all day cause I know me and you
Will be up all night
Up all night
If you love me right
All night

[Bridge]
So hard to keep my hands off you, I'm trying
Yeah I'm trying to fight it every single time
And nobody understands this
This you and I thing

[Chorus]
Cause you got my heart around your finger
And it's so obvious, I cannot keep my cool
When we touch, you let it linger
I gotta sleep all day cause I know me and you
Will be up all night
Up all night
If you love me right
All night
Will be up all night
Up all night
If you love me right
All night
