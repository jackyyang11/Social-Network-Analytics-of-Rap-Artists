Baby rush it, rush it
Put a rush up on it
Gotta get it, get up in it
Put a rush up on it
Rush it, rush it
Put a rush up on it
Smash the gas, I gotta have it
Put a rush up on it
Rush it, rush it
Put a rush up on it
On the way, baby
Put a rush up on it
Rush it, rush it
Put a rush up on it
Ándale, baby
Put a rush up on it

[Verse]
You know I need it right, right, right, right now
Wanna beat it, beat it right, right, right, right now
Feel wrong but it's right, right, right, right now
So I'm gon' pull up, lay it down on you right now
Lil mama, I'm like, "Hey mama"
Can't be late I'ma...
Fuck them brakes I'ma...
Roll and skate on it
Skrt, skrt, I'ma
Swerve, swerve, I'ma
Err, err, I'ma
Put in work
I'ma put in work
