Verse 1: I put syrup on my blunt bitch I'm an addict
I was down went back up I'm back at it
Is it she is it just me I'm just peaked
She want 3 pound I want 4 four pound we want 3
I got free bandz on the way be about 3
I'm a young fly nigga that shit that don't mean
We got more money more money too see
I be rapping in that tongue like I can't speak
I'm On lean I'm on lean that codeine
My young niggas go extreme
Play with me, My young niggas go extreme
About the very littlest of things

Got the trap doin numbers like Chinese
In my hood my name rang they kno me
011 momma house that's on me( I swear)

Verse 2: I got syrup all in my cup no need for acid
I was down now a nigga has it
They was sleep on me like a mattress
Now I'm froze flexing on these hoes in traffic
Pull up froze, flexing on these hoes all in traffic
Swear Popi fucked a hunnid hoes out in magic
Throwing up these hundreds Baby bar that's  what's  happenin
1800 for the red pints them niggas taxing
1800 for the red pints them niggas taxing
Fucking up that paper like I ain't got nothing too lose
Fucking up that money like I got something to prove
Goin in on every song, bitch I got something to do
Goin on every song, I gave a rap nigga the blues
Give a Bitch nigga the same

Riding with a lil hoe she all chinese
Fuck a nigga good but don't understand what she speak
Fuck a nigga good but don't understand what she speak
