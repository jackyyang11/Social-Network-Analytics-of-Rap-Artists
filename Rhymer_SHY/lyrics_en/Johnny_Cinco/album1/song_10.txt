[Verse 1]
Pistol Papi, how ya doing?
From the villa in the ruins
Fucked the bitch and left her ruined
All the money got me ruined
All the money got my mind blown
Papi in and out the time zones
Presidential different times zones
Presidential with the rhinestones
Lamborghini its a merci
Papi never flew commercial
New [?] this will hurt you
And ya family it'll hearse you
Papi'll never do a show again
Papi'll never do a ho again
Only if the ho bring a friend
Only if the ho bring a friend
All about the money, dollars
Ferragamo crossing commas
Blowin' Keisha on the airplane
Maserati in the fast lane
30 thou' for a plain jane
On the island wit a plain jane
John Papi on the same thang
Stack my money tryna maintain

[Bridge]
She gone pop her pussy for a real nigga
Kill for a real nigga
Nothin changed she'll do some thangs for a real nigga
Live for a real nigga
She'll do it big for a real nigga, [Woo]

[Hook]
I got deposits
I got them bricks and deposits
Don't ya tell nobody
Don't ya tell nobody
I got deposits
I got them [Shh] and deposits [Shh]
Don't ya tell nobody
Don't ya tell nobody

[Verse 2]
I got deposits
I got the bricks and deposits
Jump out the Masi, She wanna drive in the rari
She wanna go to the mansion and run down some glass of the light
She wanna go to the mansion but I cannot let her go
See I gotta let her go
[Yeah] Papi want a hunnit ladies
I be going in, I beat it up like a runaway
I heat it up like a hunnit flames
Eat it like a Benihana place
She know papi want a hunnit ladies
She know papi want a hunnit staples
And she don't tell nobody
We don't tell nobody [Yea]
All these damn deposits, we don't tell nobody [Yea]
Half a million in my closet
Bitch you better not tell nobody [Yea]
