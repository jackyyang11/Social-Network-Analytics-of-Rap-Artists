[Intro]
We're down to 5. Jordan, putting the moves on Russell. We're down to 2, down to 1. Here is Jordan, yes! It is all over, the Chicago Bulls have won at the buzzer in Game 1 in the best of seven
What you gon' do shawty?
I mean, you gon' sit on the bench
You gon' point or you gon' be a scorer, you know what I'm saying?
I mean, you gon' pass nigga, or you gon' be a scorer, you know what I'm saying?
I worked too hard for this shit man, I swear
Go hard with this shit everyday, you feel me?

[Chorus]
When I'm broke, at night I pray
We gon' ball forever, we gon' ball forever, we gon' ball forever
We gon' ball forever, we gon' ball forever, we gon' ball forever
We gon' ball forever
Sit in the trap and count up cake
We gon' ball forever, we gon' ball forever, we gon' ball forever
We gon' ball forever, we gon' ball forever, we gon' ball forever

[Verse 1]
We gon' ball on y'all, hundreds on all of y'all, money on all of y'all
My stack tall on y'all, tryna fill the safe up
Make a nigga hate us, hah, riding in the latest
Run from the fakers, uh, this for the takers
I'm in the traphouse, I'm with all the bakers, ooh
I'm in a rack house, I'm with all the makers
Money it make us, but where did it take us?
Big old house with the acres, now ice in my Jacob
Now ice in my bracelet, I got ice in my drank cup
Tryna put the pain up, tell her put the bank up
Know them niggas ain't us, yeah

[Chorus]
When I'm broke, at night I pray
We gon' ball forever, we gon' ball forever, we gon' ball forever
We gon' ball forever, we gon' ball forever, we gon' ball forever
We gon' ball forever
Sit in the trap and count up cake
We gon' ball forever, we gon' ball forever, we gon' ball forever
We gon' ball forever, we gon' ball forever, we gon' ball forever

[Verse 2]
We gon' ball, they can hate, fuck 'em all
They hate I made it, they appalled
I made a way, now they call us
Hundred bottles, throw 'em all up
Real street nigga, baby girl you should applaud us
Real street nigga, all my diamonds looking water
It's a real street nigga, baby girl you can't afford us
It's a real street nigga, I might pull up in a foreign
Young nigga ball hard, hard like he Jordan
Young nigga ball, ball hard like he Jordan
Might wake up buy a presidential early in the morning

[Chorus]
When I'm broke, at night I pray
We gon' ball forever, we gon' ball forever, we gon' ball forever
We gon' ball forever, we gon' ball forever, we gon' ball forever
We gon' ball forever
Sit in the trap and count up cake
We gon' ball forever, we gon' ball forever, we gon' ball forever
We gon' ball forever, we gon' ball forever, we gon' ball forever
