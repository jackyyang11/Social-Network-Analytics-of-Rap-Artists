[Hook]
The coupe cost me half a hundred
The engine in back of me
The shoes cost a rack a piece
Oh what a tragedy
The hoes comin' after me
I bought them a bag a piece
I put them hoes on the yacht
I fucked them hoes on the spot

[Bridge (2x)]
These hundreds is all I got
This Rollie is all I got
My niggas is all I got
We on the the way to the top

[Verse 1]
My niggas they from the bottom, made a way to the top
Started off from the block, now we ride Bentley drops
Them bitches, they on the way. They all wanna go to Paris
They all want a Louie bag, the ring with the big ole karats
This Rollie is all I got, 60k for my watch
100k for the spot, all the way at the top
Jimmy Choo all I got
Chinchilla through the winter, chinchilla through the summer, I put that shit on my mama
My nigga run in your spot, that yopper is all they got
They don't know no other way, they kick in the door, see they want the safe
They tie up the kids and mama, they found all the bricks in the Hummer
Yeah, they found all the bricks in the Hummer

[Hook & Bridge]

[Verse 2]
These hundreds is all I got, this Rollie is all I got
My niggas is all I got, I dropped that fork in the pot
Popi fucked up the pot, Popi fucked up the block
Heard they ran in the spot, but we wasn't in the spot
We got another spot. They should've went to the other spot
Gave the trap all I got, gave the block all I got
Maserati all I got, told my niggas all I got
All I got, told my niggas all I got, gave the rap all I got
