[Chorus]
My time, get it
You gon' see downfalls, just a young nigga
Stack it up and flip it then we done with it
Throw it up, rep it, where you from nigga?
611 me, 611 me, 611 me
611 me, 611 me, 611 me
I'm the one man, yeah

[Verse 1]
Where you from? 24
I been through that storm, almost lost my arm
Diamonds on my arm, look like rain now
I done changed now, I'm on a new one
Traded in my old bitch for a new one
Shawty got a pocket full of blue shit
Shawty got a pocket full of blue strips
F&N, shawty rocking blue tips
Hundred dropping cash, new slips
Hundred thousand cash, two trips
Hundred thousand, shawty I got proof here
Sipping out the can, deuces

[Chorus]
My time, get it
You gon' see downfalls, just a young nigga
Stack it up and flip it then we done with it
Throw it up, rep it, where you from nigga?
611 me, 611 me, 611 me
611 me, 611 me, 611 me
I'm the one man, yeah

[Verse 2]
Run it up and stack it, stack it up and flip it
I was on the grind, only way to live it
We done took some losses, everybody living
Started with a fifty, for a Crown Vic
Now I'm in a Lambo, swerving just like Rambo
Most days like Rambo, mallow for my fammo
She wanna be fammo, but she cannot be fam
She cannot be fam, I don't give no damn
My partner stole the same year I put him in the traphouse
I'm talking them racks now, they hear it in my tracks now
I'm focused, I'm relaxed now
You know a nigga back now, yeah

[Chorus]
My time, get it
You gon' see downfalls, just a young nigga
Stack it up and flip it then we done with it
Throw it up, rep it, where you from nigga?
611 me, 611 me, 611 me
611 me, 611 me, 611 me
I'm the one man, yeah
