[Intro]
You now tuned in right motherfuckin' now nigga
Street money bankroll fresh

[Hook: Tracy T]
Big face hundreds, rubber bands on me
I'm leadin' new school with it all on me
Them Forgiatos, rubber bands on me
And you can get it, I got it all on me
Big face hundreds, rubber bands on me
I'm leadin' new school with it all on me
Them Forgiatos, rubber bands on me
And you can get it, I got it all on me

[Verse 1: Tracy T]
Them bankrolls too big for my pocket
That AR-15 kick like karate
Fuck who you is, over here you nobody
The watch piece got these lil bitches walkin'
50 thousand for my feet to go in 'em
500 (?) Japanese denim
My plane shit just cost a lil more
Fly shit only, bad bitches onboard
(?) streets smell
Hot nigga gave the streets hell
Lil money know it's X lords
Out these super charts
(?)
Play your part
How my hand was dealt, that's how I play them cards
Barrel size of a nigga arm, lil Vietnam
Rich nigga and a dope ho
With a bankroll and a long nose

[Hook: Tracy T]
Big face hundreds, rubber bands on me
I'm leadin' new school with it all on me
Them Forgiatos, rubber bands on me
And you can get it, I got it all on me
Big face hundreds, rubber bands on me
I'm leadin' new school with it all on me
Them Forgiatos, rubber bands on me
And you can get it, I got it all on me

[Verse 2: Bankroll Fresh]
You can get it nigga, what's the issue?
Shinin' hard fuck it, they takin' pictures
Bitches on my dick, it's one night stand, you understand it?
All these fuckin' hundreds, I rubber band it
Bitch if it's hot, I spread 'em out I let 'em famine
I made your bitch become a fan of me
I'm at the top where we planned to be
Me and my niggas rollin' swishas
Out the zip you niggas play, I zip you up
500 for these Louie Chucks
1000 cause the jeans enough
You nigga talkin' you get bust
I don't gotta rap I do this shit for fun
Ran through a whole ton
Count a lot of fuckin' ones
Get your ass hit with this here drum
And that's the end and nigga that's a fact

[Hook: Tracy T]
Big face hundreds, rubber bands on me
I'm leadin' new school with it all on me
Them Forgiatos, rubber bands on me
And you can get it, I got it all on me
Big face hundreds, rubber bands on me
I'm leadin' new school with it all on me
Them Forgiatos, rubber bands on me
And you can get it, I got it all on me
