Tracy T:
Got all the qualities, hoes wanna holla'
They just want the dollas'
Don't give 'em a chance
Roll with revolvers, & roll with a choppa'
I pop it
& probably hit you & your mans
I was at saks & spent 1,500 lil' nigga
& that was just only for jeans
My bitch, with me, she rockin' chanel
& she rolling up purp
& i bought us a lean
Roll with the wraiths
But they got the ghosts
Pull up on bitches that take off they clothes
See the sky dough dancing all on my sleeve
Cause a lil' nigga just got off a load
Walking on jimmy, she walking on fendi
You got a problem i give you the business
Let this lil' bullets walk all up yo' face
Surrounded  by killas so you know i'm wit' it(woah woah)
You know i'm wit it, bro got the extensions
All up in LA i'm feeling like jefe
Smoking on spinach & sending them chickens
Shout-out meek milly, we fucking with Philly
Just bought a mansion, & filled it with bitches
My nigga just call me from back in the city
Said they need money, but fuck it, i get it
Bought, brand new Balenciaga
New Bentley do the throttle
Never did rock Prada, break a nigga off proper
We robbin' the robbers ya'll niggas is not us
Nigga, we shootin' up all of the shottas(bang bang bang)
Nigga, we shootin' up all of the shottas
Nigga, we shootin' up all of the shottas

Verse 2 - Tracy T
Bitches face-timing from back in the days
Them the same bitches wouldn't give me a chance
This for the thrill, i'm pullin' up fucking her
Only cause she got the bow-legged stance
Cashmere sweater, tracy t Hefner
Run a lil' extra, running with a heckler
Higher than delta, hotter than the devil
Nigga i'll melt you, cayenne pepper
Nigggas they savages running through packages
& they be wrapping it, all for the cheese
You ain't packing it, you just be rapping it
Pour up the actavis, some in these streets
Pull up in beverly hills, car got the gears
Switching up gear, diamonds is clear
Rolling with about a hundred on me
Nigga i'll buy the lil' bitch if I want it
Riding in foreigns, & they back to back
Back to back how i be spending the cash
Diamonds is clear, & is looking like glass
Can't stop me now, bitch i'm all in my bag
Riding in a stingray, all on the e-way
Head to PJ, you know how we play
My brodie, he strapped with a 40
You niggas ain't fucking with shawty
I flew it in over sonoma
Got money, a couple of commas
That carbine is holding a hunnid
Birds on the east, now i'm all up in london
Back on the east, i just got me some weed
I just flip me 100, i got it from nothing (woah)
I flip me 100, & got it from nothing, bitch!
Nigga, we shootin' up all of the shottas(bang bang nigga)
Nigga, we shootin' up all of the shottas
Nigga, we shootin' up all of the shottas
Nigga, we shootin' up all of the shottas

Shoot em up (x6)
Shooting up them shottas (x2)
Shoot em up (x5)
Shooting up them shottas (x2)
