[Intro]
Yeah
Say it's a dangerous world we live in
It's a dangerous game we play
Sad to say
You gotta stay dangerous just to stay safe
Words of the real, real words
It's like that forever
We honorable to them c notes, you dig
Naw for real
DJ on the beat so it's a banger
Honorable C-Note

[Verse 1]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Bitch you not bad, you got baggage
Put on that shit, yeah that fashion
No nothing like but my Caddy
Get it and wrap it
Aston Martin, yeah the rapid
Dope money put in the matress
I pay them 4k just to wrap it
So I got a luxury tax
Migo pull up speaking Spanish
They might just take of with your family, woah
Ride the whole club like a banshee
Nigga get flipped and I'm standing
Do the whole shit like I planned it
Come with a drum set, like I'm Marilyn Manson
I rock and roll with them cannons
C note and c note and c note
I went up to a hundred from a zero
I'm on the penthouse on top the casino
Spending that profit I got from them kilos
Hundred k, andale, Imma have fun today
Put on that shit, I'ma shine like a sunny day
Run to the money, lil bitch you a run-away
This a V12 and it's running, you want a race?
I done ran out of patience
I'ma go get it, they had me waiting
Road to the riches, no navigation
Bentley truck, this ain't no navigator
