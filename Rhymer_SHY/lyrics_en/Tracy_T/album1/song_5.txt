[Intro]
And they ask me
How you been?
Where you been?
How you been where you been?
I been good

[Verse 1]
Light this bitch up with a rainbow wrist, got aim won't miss
Got K want bricks, AZ no Mitch
Fuck is you saying, not too much
Your hoe let the crew fuck, but I don't give two fucks
In the streets you gotta have a vertebrate
I'm going up like the Chicago murder rate
Staying down to up the salary nigga
Staying down too much gravity nigga
Foreign pussy, charm full of boogers
Mean to tell me hate is unexpected
They hated on me, time waited on me
Man in the mirror, they can't face that
When they show they head
Keep playing your cards
I got even going against the odds
Did dirt, had to go to church
Went left and got right with god
Where I been y'all wanna know
Money piling higher while I was laying low
Niggas hoes, ain't gon call no names
But without the pain I wouldn't have a lane
Appreciate the hate, make them all mad
Before it was all good it was all bad
Tracy T, why you ain't dropped yet?
Before I fall on my face I'll fall back

[Interlude]
I mean shit, I ain't your average rap nigga
I gotta get money
When rap ain't paying the bills
The bills gotta still be paid
The kids still gotta eat
But one thing about I come from the concrete
We ain't never had soft sheets where I come from, you dig
Yeah, as far as the Maybach contract, that shit over
(Mmmmmmm Maybach Music)

[Verse 2]
Shoutout to Rozay, we murder like OJ
The glove didn't fit it, they gotta acquit it
Back to back Maybach, it's me and Meek Milly
Money Bound chain on my neck from the midget
Fuck a big L, we ain't taking no L's
Sending fake paper work trynna fuck up the business
I couldn't believe that these niggas believed it
Charge it to the game [?]
I'm highly favored, still fighting with demons
I steam a nigga like he fresh out the cleaners
Ask a nigga about me, bet he hold penis
Ask a bitch, I bet she tell you I'm genius
I said it I meant it, stay on it I mean it
I'm fly as a bird bitch, I move like a phoenix
Bird on my neck, I won't settle for less
I rose out the ashes, I'm back and I'm beasting, you dig

[Outro]
Any more questions?
Hahaha
In other words, fuck what you heard
Believe what you see
It ain't what you don't know
It's about what you know nigga
Speed up before you slow niggas
This Money Bound about to drop for real
Singles set sales nigga, you dig
