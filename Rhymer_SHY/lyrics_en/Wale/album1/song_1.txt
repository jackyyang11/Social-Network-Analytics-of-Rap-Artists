[Wale]
I promised Ricky and Milly that I知a kill it
Runnin' throughout them digits and dollars homie I'm Emmitt
I知 runnin'
I知 so 100 with every nigga I run with
Tell them niggas we coming
We fuckin' it up this summer

[Meek Mill]
And I知 stuntin' like it ain稚 nothin'
Most of these niggas frontin'
I pull this Rollie from trappin'
I got this Beamer from nothin'
If they ain稚 talking bout paper
Just tell them end of discussion
And now that I知 getting money
My neighbors turn to my cousins

[Wale]
Gold bottles, lot of bitches
Deep thinker, I知 sorry you're such a shallow nigga
The mind on me just shine on them, you shadow women
Ridin' with rats you niggas should be in glass slippers

[Meek Mill]
Ha, and I don稚 never ask the price on it
Married to the money hater, throw some rice on it
I told my jeweler get my Muller, throw some ice on it
I treat that pussy like its Tina, I go Ike on it
Beat it up, I知 getting heated up
When I say I知 high, I ain稚 talking weeded up

[Wale]
Bitch I知 talkin' G5, Teterboro, feet is up
Beaverton my sneaker game although I never be with ducks
Me and Meek, treein' up

[Meek Mill]
He lying I知 on papers
But when I knock this shit off, I'mma go and buy some Laker shit
I知 talking bout that Cali kush, We get work and Bally push
Two bad bitches in the back, they pretty everybody look

(Wale)
Bitch I知 hot as Wasabi in Abu Dhabi
In a sauna with some models, who treat it like edemame
I ain稚 thugging, I ain稚 robbing, I知 puffing on my broccoli
Doing 100 in a bucket, do like 20 in a 喪ari

(Meek Mill)
And I知 back on this shit again, Pressie blue like Michigan
I put on for my city I should ball with Vick and them
When I get my V12, I知a be in Six of them
Riding round with Lou, me, and your sister, and your sister痴 friend

(Wale)
Hold up
Got the fridgedest temperature on my wrist again
Shiny shit to niggas is like givin' children Ritalin
Bamma's sittin' in the pen, see you in a minute yo
And them haters went away as soon as I left Interscope

(Meek Mill)
Big money, I知 talking bad hoes
You niggas full of shit, fucking assholes
I知 in this presidential suite, I知 in my bathrobe
Counting 100 grand I pulled it from my last show
Shitting on them, something I ain稚 mean to do
These hoes do anything, our wish is like a genie do
A nigga buy a point, here take the nina too
I get a chick to come and serve you like Serena do

[Wale]
I think its genius leanin' will do when you in a groove
Stuntin', I知 in the sixth
I call that shit that middle school
High as shit, I知 in a booth
Denver Nugget number 2s
And I don稚 gotta front, I play these niggas like a wisdom tooth
This is where the Wizards play, this is where them bitches play
We'd have you fallin' and now you scrapin' from that Kemba shake
On the day a hater treat a nigga like he fake
That'd be the day his label treat him like a signal fade

[Meek Mill]
And I知 ballin' bitch
I知 ballin' bitch
Me, Wale, so hard - as shit
Get your budget money back, fire all your artists-es
We be burnin' everything, they label us as arsonists
If I ain't middle of the track, I'm 106 and Parkin' it
Bitch
