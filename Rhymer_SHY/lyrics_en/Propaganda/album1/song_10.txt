[Verse 1: Propaganda]
Art for your heart ache
Art for art's sake
Ixnay on the cop outs
General market drop outs
Admit it we participants and citizens
Of Babylon your innocence is long gone
Yet, humility and confidence ain't opposites
So stand with wing span of a vulture
Unafraid of the culture
God nominates a team to dominate the arena
Like home court advantage don't even matter
Leavin' heathen breathin heavy
Like the altitude you can't stand it
How do these fools movin planets?
I done took the dude for granted, Daniel style take my chances
Sleep overs with lions
None of us is compromising lyin'
Flying higher than the competition
Listen the plan, I ain't chasing infinite fans
Just a fan of Chace Infinite and
Me glad who so ever chased up [?]
Reach Records and Ana Paul
All my people conquer

[Verse 2: Theory Hazit]
Faith come by hearing too many deaf though
Clinging onto static let God and let go
On your mark let go on sin, we make war
Dumb sixteen turned around and spit eight more
Frontline soldier in attack mode
Slayin every lusty impulse grabbing at my soul
A lot of folks want to make peace within
But it makes no sense
They make peace with sin
And when I talk war I don't mean Athena
Save your long-winded arguments step in to the arena
And see Christ conquer
Idolize monsters
[?]
The warrior in combat
Gave it all he got gave his life
Rescued us from a place so hot
Battle my flesh when it get's in the way
Die daily I commit suicide every day killa
That mean he lives in me
I live in him he's the conquering king
War wounds to prove him when you thought we lost him
He's the very reason that we can conquer
I'm sick and tired of people blaming the devil
When we need accountability
Growth, and never settle
For your maturity levels like filthy rags
And when he conquer everybody wave a white flag
