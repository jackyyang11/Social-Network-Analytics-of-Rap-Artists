We don't assume we're at ease because the news cameras leave. Because closing curtains don't make stars disappear, and Band-Aids don't cure cancer, but they sure are comfort, and what's wrong with giving comfort? Because feelings fade and generosity is contagious. Because pain is not sexist or racist. We could learn a thing or two from the tenacity of tragedy. Once it locks onto your scent, it's just a matter of time and the only difference between mortgage and food banks is moments. Precious moments. Because objects rust and break, memories fade, but moments are eternal. We give moments. Because we've been given them. Because we live with the tension of how undeserving we are for the breath we have. Breaths, moments, are gifts, freely given. Who am I to hoard them? We give. Because we love and we love. Because we were loved first. Who am I to hoard it?
