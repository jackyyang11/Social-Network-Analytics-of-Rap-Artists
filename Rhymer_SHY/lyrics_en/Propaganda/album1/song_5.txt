[Hook: Propaganda]
I could tell the future, we're a broken record
I'ma say something then I'm gon' regret it
And you'll put up a wall and I'ma try to wreck it
Love is not love if it's never been tested

[Verse 1: Propaganda & Marz Ferrer]
Why couldn't you just hug me?
Look me in the eyes and tell me love is lovely
Ribbons in the sky that Stevie Wondie flung me
Sing lullabies to the son you brung me
But your eyes just won't keep they mouth shut
Wait a minute, how come you get to choose our outcome?
It's quite a tussle, have we become that couple
Where our love is just comfortable?
And you used to teach me to be a better me
And I would front like my feet were tree trunks
I'm so sorry, I promise kiss with eucalyptus
With all of its problems, I don't never wanna miss this

[Hook: Propaganda]
I could tell the future, we're a broken record
I'ma say something then I'm gon' regret it
And you'll put up a wall and I'ma try to wreck it
Love is not love if it's never been tested

[Chorus: Marz Ferrer]
Bear with me as we wander through the dark
Take care of me, illuminate my heart
Baby, bear with me as we wander through the dark
Take care, take care, illuminate my heart

[Verse 2: Propaganda]
And the love that was once a mighty California redwood's
A piss-poor version of a sycamore in Singapore
Sing a poor hymn makes me sick more than lactose
Sit and pour another shot of Maker's 'til I'm sick more
I should take you out to Liverpool to live a more exciting life
Instead I'm in my inbox trying to gig some more
You give more, you get more and I'm just trying to get more
Wink-wink, in the end, I married my best friend
But think-think the thrill is gone but not forgotten
Girl, you spoiled rotten, only cowards quit, it ain't an option
I'm booking me a red-eye with a case of "I'm sorry"
In my carry-on in hopes to share the pillow that you rest on

[Hook: Propaganda]
I could tell the future, we're a broken record
I'ma say something then I'm gon' regret it
And you'll put up a wall and I'ma try to wreck it
Love is not love if it's never been tested

[Chorus: Marz Ferrer]
Bear with me as we wander through the dark
Take care of me, illuminate my heart
Baby, bear with me as we wander through the dark
Take care, take care, illuminate my heart

[Outro: Marz]
Bear with me, bear with me
Oh, bear with me
