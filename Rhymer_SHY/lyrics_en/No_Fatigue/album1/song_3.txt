[Intro]

FGE shit man
Its No Fatigue
Yeah

[Verse 1: No Fatigue]

In your circle you got squares
All of you niggas is Belgium
I was a young baby boy
Now my pockets sitting on Melvin
And my niggas ain't with the drama
So please move around just like 12-in
Like when water run up on a beach
Bro'nem don't wanna leave shells in
I'm not to them hoes, So I ain't catching feelings
I guess I'm a villain
Like joker and venom
If shit get too loud
We gon' blow like a eardrum
My flow is too sick
I swear this was the symptoms
This shit in my jeans
I Ain't talking 'bout denim
I [?] money comin'
I swear I can feel it
God gave me this gift, I guess Ima' run wit' it
Yeah
Money on a nigga like this shit is taped on
Every city that we hit, We hit them model way long
Tell shawty she bad as hell yeah she a rare form
Pull it if her hair long
Like Harry hit her with the wand
Fuck all them niggas that hate on us
That's why you get jailed like a shoe in a box
Can't put out this fire I'm hot
They knew that shit right on the spot
Post up like cars the gang got a lot
Get on this D and ride me out the lot
Get on this D and drop it like squat
Free Billy, free swazy
Shit not a maybe
I see The view its so HD
I smoke a square like I'm outside a bar, if he start acting crazy
Bro'nem keep the 40 right by his side, like he holding a baby
Niggas better be careful, my gang is the shit
Take your bitch like a pic'
Hit her with that magic, I pipe her
She got two sisters just like her
We tell em' just like a nightclub
And spray that champagne, that's the right stuff
Screw on her just like a light bulb
Screw on her just like a light bulb
Hit her with that bat just like Bam Bam
Dunkin' that pussy no slamcam
Tell bro to roll up that herb
High man, I can't say a word
If he pass me the rock
I'ma shoot the ball like Zorb
On my way to the bread
I'm about to hit the right turn
You niggas mad it's my turn
Why you hating it's  my turn
At the top with the chips like a vending machine
Just like a zipper try to get in between
Slide in like a dollar at vending machines
Like I got a rash, I need the cream
Some of my dogs play with K's and 9's
Bitch I'ma dog, but I wanna screw
Just like [?], boy I'm the truth
I got the sauce, I got the juice
You ain't gotta ask A$AP to let him that I'm dope
Better watch out like 2Chainz, I'll pull your bitch like a rope
I be all up in her mouth in the morning, no scope
Write my name on her like a note
What I'm saying here is not a joke
Shawty say she love it when, I scroll through like Instagram
Shawty say she love it when, I sing just like music
Bunch of bitches wanna do the squad, wanna ride a cruise ship
Tryna be up in that store then fire (Don't fuck with substition)
Shots sing like Do-Re-Me, I'm just gon' go KD until they OKC
Till I start rappin' ugh, bitch you ain't notice me
Hop on a track get to snappin' like poetry
Poke that pussy like a colon
Come down the middle like bowlers
I snap dawg you think I'm D'Rosing
Beat pacific in the ocean
When I'm done gon' need some roses
I spit dope see bucks like coke leaves
I'm on top in her mouth like gold teeth
When we fuck man I swear I had No Fatigue
And these boys ain't chasin' money so it's more for me
