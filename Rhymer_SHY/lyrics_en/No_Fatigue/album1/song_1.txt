Yeah it's 'Tigue
But you know it's not the one up in the league
I be me
Nothing less or more, that's just what you see
Got shit locked, and I got the key
Gotta follow me
On these beats, killin everybody like I'm on the street
Boy you weak
Knew you was gon' fold, that shit don't look neat
Niggas talk, that don't get you green
That shit get you sleeped
I show love everywhere I be, that's what they show me
Fuck you mean?
Bitch it's FGE, like Russ I got the wings
Stop fronting like you on that money
You don't really want it
All these bitches, man these hoes be on me
Watch me like I'm Sony
And my pockets got that extra weight, them bitches was bony
Hop out clean, yeah
Bitch I'm Gucci, they thinkin they told me
Different women always in my line, some callin me phony
And they mad I got these different flavors, something like a (?)
People hatin just to see me make it
But, gotta take it
Try to take it, well then I'm gon' make it
*BAP BAP* till it's vacant
Fell in that bitch like a layup
A nigga like me gotta stay up
I grew up and yeah I stayed prayed up
Blowing that gas, I be faded
And all of my feelings be fading, I be stayin fly like I'm Radon
Don't care about nothin you saying, bitch really fuck what you saying
Your bitch always stoppin by my crib like the store
Coming for that dope, but it's not that shit you smoke
Told all of my niggas "Just bear with me" like a Coke
And most of these bitches goin for me like a vote
Free Billy, that's my fuckin dog, we was supposed to ball
He put down that ball, picked up that gas, and he picked up them calls
I put down that ball, picked up that gas, and I picked up them bars
Strengthen all my flaws, gotta be smart, now I'm built for it all
Young and black, everyday is gettin colder
Touch on shorty body like I'm tryna mold her
She gon' bite down quicker then a cobra
And she be D Moss, she like how that Derozan
Like a fairy godmother, got that potion
That pussy clown, then that pussy get exposure
I be out here in the world livin my fuckin dream
Anybody get up in my way, like a fuckin screen
It will be mask on like I'm Future, think I'm fuckin Scream
Whoever round gon' make a fuckin scene like a fuckin scene
But can't you see a nigga all together like I'm with my team
Like a heart attack, uh, bitch you miss your beat
Like Lil Wayne I miss my dogs, just got memories
Like Lil Wayne I miss my dogs, just got memories
Like Lonzo yeah I'mma ball while I'm with my team
Always did what I had to never been the least
Yeah, never been the least
Swear life can make you fall like a nigga reached
Aye, like a nigga reached
RIP my bro Wop, yeah I miss you B
