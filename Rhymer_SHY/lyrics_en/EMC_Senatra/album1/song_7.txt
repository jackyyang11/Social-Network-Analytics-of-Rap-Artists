[Hook]
I'm livin' in this world
Trouble's all around
Tryna' build a place to live in
Set freedom right now

[Verse 1]
Walk through my area, local gangs and police around me
Abandoned houses, me and my homies with drugs around me
I wasn't thinking 'bout my family, I was seeing profit
Until I got booked at that show, I probably should have tossed it
[?] fucking drugs out, I said I'm done without a doubt
My mom don't want me in the house so now I'm searching for a route
All I see is filthy pathways, smoking think of my past ways
Roll a blunt, see the ash fade
Drink don't think how good it damn taste
Reminiscing on my life, predicting where I'd be
Thinking if I die tonight would Jrox be the first I see
Cause really I don't know where Imma' go if I would die tonight
I just hope my time is right and get to kiss my mom goodbye

[Hook]
I'm livin' in this world (yeah)
Trouble's all around (I've been going through shit on a daily basis but I always get through it man)
Tryna' build a place to live in (I walk a hundred miles in my shoes and I ain't got no problem walking a hundred more)
Set freedom right now
I'm livin' in this world (cause I'm willing to die for what I stand for)
Trouble's all around
Tryna' build a place to live in
Set freedom right now

[Verse 2]
(uh, uh, uh)
I bet the people I cut off would die to be in my picture
[?] known I wouldn't make it with everyone that I'm with
But I know it won't be the same
Through your smile I see the fangs
Your misconception is [?] you're slick but I know the game
I've grown into what you make me so hate me all that you want
You're hiding your jealousy, disguising [?]
Now I'm high on a day to day
Getting tats take the pain away
Speaking words like a poet
My life's a song, let the record play
Overcoming my obstacles I remain humble
Cause everybody that's with me came from the same struggle
They remind me where I come from and what I believe in
South Central, L.A where I remain breathing

[Hook]
I'm livin' in this world
Trouble's all around ( [?] )
Tryna' build a place to live in (where all my homies smoking weed)
Set freedom right now (huh)
I'm livin' in this world (beautiful women everywhere)
Trouble's all around ( [?] the day I lost Jrox again)
Tryna' build a place to live in
Set freedom right now (yeah)
