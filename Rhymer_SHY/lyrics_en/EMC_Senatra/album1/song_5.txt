[Hook: EMC Senatra]
I know them gang bangers that kill (kill, kill)
I know them drug dealers that deal (deal, deal)
I know them gang bangers that kill (kill, kill)
I know them drug dealers that deal (deal, deal)

[Verse 1: 2Tone]
I'm telling these hoes, where my clicks at?
I'm up in South Gate smoking weed ‘til it's pitch black
I thought I told you, bitch I'm coming [?] up in California
Know when I'm creeping up on you, what you wanna do?
Can't fuck with me
Smoking [?] with my click
Up in South Gate it's the shit
And they know I'm up on Tweedy and they knowin' how I grip
Gripping the [?], flipping the cane
Sick in the brain, switching the lane
Dumping my chick, fucking your bitch
Trying to get her to sucking my dick
Bitches they come through ready
Bitch I come through heavy
Bitch when I came through your home girl was a little too friendly
So fuck you and your momma, talking to me about comma
Problems with me you don't want none
I keep it G with that drama

[Verse 2: EMC Senatra]
I deal with this on a daily
A savage is all that it made me
I've been through the gutter before (bitch)
Struggle is all that I know (bitch)
My homies gang banging with attitude
If you want it with me then they after you
I'm making the moves that I have to do
I'm living this way cause the avenue
I've been out by the west side chilling
5-0 everywhere where I'm living
South Central, L.A since day one
I knew that I was the shit
I'm a goon you can tell by my click
Face tats on homies I'm with
This the life I cannot resist
‘til I die the K I stick with
Are you really down to ride for this?
Getting buried with your homie by your side for this
Jrox and I gon' die for this
Cause the streets got a hold on me
Why you tryna hate on me?
L.A got a hang on me
People that I influenced [?] bang these streets
And the ones that tell me hustle pushing packs all week
