Tobacco Out The Window
Gold Platinum With The Indo
In The Camry The Windows Tinted
In The Passenger
With Smoke All In It
Smoke All In It
In The Passenger
With Smoke All In It
Smoke All In It
In The Passenger
With Smoke All In It

[Verse 1]
In My Four Corner Room
Thinking Of The Next Move
We All Get Crazy
Trying To Hold On Our Own Cool
Money On The Mind
While We Tryna Roll A Doobie
My Girl Be Trippin'
Trying To Make My Life A Movie
Left From The 8
Trying To Get My Shit Straight
While My People Looking At Me
Like If It Was All Hate
After All The Time
I Broke Bread With The Snakes
Calling Up Memo
Saying Let's Ride To The Gates
So We Ride To The Gate
We Gon' Ride Till The Day
I Got The Big Homies
Rolling With The AK
And They Don't Listen
To Anything That You Gotta Say
If You Wanna Go To War For No Reason
We Gon' Bring It
We Could Go Missing In The Smoke
Whenever I Get Faded
I'll Be Cruisin Down Slauson
In The Passenger Blazing
Make A Right On Alameda
While We Rolling Up The Cake
I Got My Girl Revi
That Could Roll It When I'm Straight

With Smoke All In It
Smoke All In It

With Smoke All In It

[Verse 2: King Lil G]
I Told My Little Homie
That I'm Really Down To Ride With It
Utilize The Nine
Encase These Suckas Out Of Line With It
Think Somebody Snitching
Cause They Trying To Say That I Did It
Never Showed My Face
No Case To My Time With It
Bitch Can't You Tell That I'm A Criminal
Can't You Tell I Rep My Shit In Every Visual
I Put A Couple Of These Bitches
In My Videos
And Then I Went & Cashed A Check For My Residuals
Gangsta Individual
Never To A Minimal
Homies With The Straps
And The Scratched Off Serials
Need To Stop Playing With Me
Homie Caught A Plane with Me
Went To Chicago
Then I Brought Em To L.A. With Me
Occasionally You Should Blaze With Me
Call Up The Squad
It's Okay With Me
It's Okay With Me
I Call Up Chantelle To Stay With Me
