[verse] EMC
I remember when i didn't have a place to sleep
Looking back to when i didn't have no food to eat
My parents arguing i dont know how long i could take it
I be a coward if i broke down every situation
But i made it so could you, look at what they put me thru
Breathin in the living hell but i dont want no different shoes
These streets are cold come walk with me thru alaska
My mom left my dad so for 3 years they called me bastard
I was going thru its tough, i ain't never had enough
But it turned me to a young man that just dont give a fuck
Why they searching for the best high, throwing up the westside
Im stressin over here tryna figure how to get shit right
And ever since i lost my dog its getting hard to cope
But he goin' live thru me and imma make it for us both
My girls been telling me i ain't the same i know its true
But tell me where your head will be if your friend died in front of you

[Hook 2x] Ble$$
I dont wanna feel this pain no more
These blue skys dont feel the same no more
Im tryna guard it wanna bring me down
I swear they dont wanna see me smile

[verse] EMC
I shed a tear for every kid thats in a broken home
I put my fist up in the air for every soldier gone
Cause ever since they took my brother man my life been different
And plus my girl just left me cause she said im acting distant
But what the fuck do they expect from me? feeling so alone at home
I feel it especially with matilda right next me
Crying while i would listen to song the music would set me free
Write it down, J was telling me the pen was there to set me free
So i scribble my misery and it went down in history
Inspired people listening
I still had empty pockets, but i felt rich off life
If i could start from scratch then i'd relive it twice
We all deserve to serve a purpose then we pass away
If god would answer all my questions i stay there asking for days
And even though i never hear him i just know ill be okay
I told my sister its alright one day we both gon be okay

[Hook 2x] Ble$$
I dont wanna feel this pain no more
These blue skys dont feel the same no more
Im tryna guard it wanna bring me down
I swear they dont wanna see me smile
