[Intro]
This That Type Of Shit
You Roll Around Downtown L.A
At 3 In The Mornin'
With A Bad Bitch In The Passenger
Rollin' That Indonesia In That Swisher Sweet
While You Gripping On Her Thigh
And Your Other Hand On That Steering Wheel
Swervin' Down To Main Street
Let's Make It Up

[Verse 1: Emc Senatra]
Baby Look At Me, I'm A Youngin' From Hoover Street
With A Forty Ounce Bottle, A Bag Of Weed
I Ain't Got No Role Models In Back Of Me
Only Og Killas Reppin' Westside
They Taught Me More Than Only Hold The Tec Right
I Flew In From Chicago On The Best Flight
Shay About A Roll Up With The Best High
Cause I Just Touched Down On The Westside
Even Off The Block I Rep The A On Me
Till The Day I Die, I'm On The Block On Me
Even With A Milli I'ma Stay Lowkey
Even With The Fame Im'a Still The Same Ol' G
Lately I Been Sobered Up Been Focused On The Hustle
Latley I Just Noticed That My Numbers Started To Double
Recently Just Noticed More People Want Trouble
But They Don't Really They Don't Want It
That's Something That I Know
Cause It's Ak Always, Every Day, All Day, Till I Die
Twistin' This Indonesia, Burnin' This Reefer
Till My Blood Matches My Eyes
Raisin' My Spliff To The Sky
The Thought If I Die Runs Through My Head
That's Why I'm Getting High
My Homies Stay Loyal With Much Reasons Why
Why Came From The Gutter So Don't Act Surprised

[Hook]
The Money Be Callin'
The Bitches Be Callin'
She Was Searchin' For Love (Love)
In My Cannabis Garden (Kush)
In My Cannabis Garden (Kush)
In My Cannabis Garden (Kush)
I Was Searchin' For Love (Love)
In My Cannabis Garden (Kush)

[Verse 2: Drummer Boy]
I'm From The Hood
Yeah That's Real Shit
My Mac 11
Real Kill Shit
All My Homies They Hood Rich
Even My Baby Mommma
She A Hood Bitch
Blown Off That Loud Stick
Rollin' Dice For That Pink Slip
I'm On That Green Tip
Og Shit
I'm Hittin' Licks For That 3 Flip
If You Ain't A G Then You Ain't Shit
That's What I Learned From My Whole Click
Murder Shots On My Whole Block
If Them Johnny's Come You Don't Say Shit
My Homies Locked Up In The Federal
He Keep It More G Then You'll Ever Know
If You've Got Beef In My Area
Then I Suggest That You Let It Go
Let It Go
Bitch I Be Smokin' On Medical
I Be So Lit That You Never Know
All My Killas They Roll With Me Gettin' Blown
All My Bitches They Fuck With Me On The Low
All My Homies Hittin' Licks Gettin' Doe
All These Gangstas They Fuck With Me
That's Fo'sho, That's Fo'sho, That's Fo'sho

[Hook]
The Money Be Callin'
The Bitches Be Callin'
She Was Searchin' For Love (Love)
In My Cannabis Garden (Kush)

In My Cannabis Garden (Kush)
I Was Searchin' For Love (Love)
In My Cannabis Garden (Kush)

[Verse 3: La Gunsmoke]
Homie Look At Us, We Some Killas
Come Fuck With Us And We Smokin' On Cannabis
The Bitches Fucking With These Politicians
And The Bitch I'm Fucking Works At Univision
Sex Goddess She's My New Religion
Rocking True Religion But Her Shoe Were Christian
Red Bottoms Need A Blue-Er Vision
Took Her Top Off Like Her Roof Is Missin'
Bitches Be Loving The Dick
Your Homies Wanted Then We Bustin Some Shit
AK47 All Up On My Fit
AK47 You Know That's The Click
Bitches Won't Leave Me Alone
When They Message Me
And Your Bitch, Yeah She Be Texting Me
All Up In The DM Like She Trying To Get With Me
Bitch I Do Not Got The Recipe, I Don't

[Hook 2]
The Money Be Callin'
The Bitches Be Callin'
