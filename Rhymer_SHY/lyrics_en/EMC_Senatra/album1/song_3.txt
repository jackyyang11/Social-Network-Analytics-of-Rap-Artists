[Verse 1]
Look its hard to accept the fact
That I've done you wrong
But I just wanna talk to you
Baby girl just remain calm
Cause every time I see you
Man we always seem to argue
That's why I never come over
Now and hardly tend to call you
Cause it's crazy
Don't you remember the good times we have
We hated school so we would hop the fence
And ditch to my pad
Girl it was great but not no more
I'm in the spot where I don't know
Do I really wanna be with you?
Or wanna let you go?
All your friends tell you I'm cheating
But what point are they proving?
You just believe in their assumptions
Then jump up into conclusions
I only fucked up one time
Now you never could trust me
Why the fuck you with me then?
I don't believe that you love me
I think it's just a phase
It's all a game
You know this shit is all the same
We grow apart and people change
And me and you just out of range
I'm going through some shit
I thought I'd let you know
That it's better for my health
For me to just to let you go

[Bridge]
And I don't think
We good for this
And I know you know
That it drove you sick
So let her know that I'm gone
I'm gone, I'm gone
Let her know that I'm gone
I'm gone, I'm gone
But she said

[Verse 2]
How the fuck you gonna tell me
That I didn't love you?
How the fuck you do this shit
And expect me to trust you
I guess my mom was right
A perfect couple is all a dream
But what the fuck Frank
It was only suppose to be you and me
But you gon' care when I ain't there
But know you'll still be in my prayers
Wipe them tears
You know you don't care
Cause if you did
Then you'd be right here
Saying shit that you should do
To fix it but you don't
I only want the truth for you
Why can't you admit you was wrong
You knew I was a virgin
When you fucked me too
So fuck you too
My feelings for you are so strong
That I think that I'm stuck with you
It hurts cause my mom and family
Ask for you like every day
And I cry every time I tell em
Me and you went different ways
But hey I guess learned my lesson
All that shit you put me through
Just made me stronger
I just hope you realize
I was there for you
But now I let you watch me leave
In time I'll maybe find I'm free
I just can't believe
That you and me
We're never meant to be
