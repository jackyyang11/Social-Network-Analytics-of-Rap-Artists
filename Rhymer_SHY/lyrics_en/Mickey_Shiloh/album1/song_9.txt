[Intro]
I'm sorry

[Verse 1 - Mickey Shiloh]
It's only fair if we both ignore eachother sometime
It's only fair if we do this things with no reason or right
It's only fair if you don't care and I don't care at the same time
It's only fair if I act like I'm not always right

[Chorus- Mickey Shiloh]
I'm too drunk to drive (I'm too drunk to drive)
Won't you pick me up tonight (pick me up tonight)
Fuck my pride (Fuck your pride)
Want you to know [?]
I won't try by doing this right (no lie)
All I want to say is that I apologize
Now you apologize
That would be a compromise

[Verse 2-Y2]
You're listening now
That will be a start
That will be a part
Of phasing history
Waiting in the dark
Like some up
That will be the spark
We don't need the spark, love
Do you even have a heart, love
That's a heart, love
We might have to go cold
[?] is not working, no
You say I gotta go
You blow up, ok, no
Look
Don't take it personal
What's your always cursing for
Why you couzy [?] love me love
Something to hurt you
Who hit you?
Long story

[Chorus- Mickey Shiloh]
I'm too drunk to drive (I'm too drunk to drive)
Won't you pick me up tonight (pick me up tonight)
Fuck my pride (Fuck your pride)
Want you to know [?]
I won't try by doing this right (no lie)
All I want to say is that I apologize
Now you apologize
That would be a compromise

[Verse 3 - Lex Lu]
Been a long day
Been a long night
I just wanna hide like the moonlight
I'll be on 10 so hold on tight
Tryin' to be a friend but I'm all fight
Here we go again, it's another one
We tryin' to hide with the covers on
I'm gonna try to act like there's nothing wrong
Ready to attack now my covers blown
Oh oh we'll be [?] before it's a sequel
Now we taking jabs to the corn when they eat tho
[?] other finger so we equal
Checking all the reasons to be mad now but it's [?]
All this is done in the dark
Now here we come to the light
We can say now we were wrong
Let's just agree not to fight
That would be a compromise

[Chorus- Mickey Shiloh]
I'm too drunk to drive (I'm too drunk to drive)
Won't you pick me up tonight (pick me up tonight)
Fuck my pride (Fuck your pride)
Want you to know [?]
I won't try by doing this right (no lie)
All I want to say is that I apologize
Now you apologize
That would be a compromise
