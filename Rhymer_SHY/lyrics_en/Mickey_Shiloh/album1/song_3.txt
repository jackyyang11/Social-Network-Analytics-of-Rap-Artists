Verse 1
I'm not awake I’m not asleep
I'm somewhere in between
Don't know what’s wrong with me
Guess it's time to call the pharmacy
I'm pretty sure I need therapy
A little more than Ia little weed
Cause I don't know what's happening
I just can't keep the same energy

Chorus
Up and down I go
Here's another episode
God don't let me lose control
God don’t let me lose control
Oh no
Up and down I go
Here’s another episode
God don't leave me all alone
God don’t leave me all alone

Verse 2
I know that my friends are tired of
Hearing all about my problems
So I don't say nothing no more
Nada nada nada no
Go ahead ask me how I'm doing
I say “cool man how are you?”
And we don't converse anymore
Nada nada nada no

Chorus
Up and down I go
Here’s another episode
God don't let me lose control
God don't let me lose control
Oh no
Up and down I go
Here's another episode
God don't leave me all alone
God don't leave me all alone

Don't leave me all alone
Just another episode
