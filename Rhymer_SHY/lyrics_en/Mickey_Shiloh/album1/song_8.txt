Come over to my house
Come over unannounced
Come over while this song bounces out
All you gotta do is sit and listen real quick
I'll tell you how I've been
I know you don't really care
I know you ain't ever been there
I know you won't ever be, even if I let you back in
And you know I'll let you back in so quick
Actin stupid again

I open up my mouth
I open up my blouse
I open up my heart only for you babe
I don't know why I do it...
Guess I'm just used to it

I always get what I ask for
Then I just end up asking for more
There you go knocking at my door
I'm too tired to make up a metaphor for that
Just remind me what we met up for
Oh yea... honestly I just think that I was bored
I was just bored
I was just bored

I... I... I was.. I was just bored
Baby I was just bored
Baby I was just bored... just bored
Baby I was just bored... bored
Baby I was just bored...
I was just bored...
Baby I was just bored...
