[Verse 1]
4AM an I'm smoking my pipe
All my friends aren't dead, we FaceTime
Got no 9 to 5s and we alright
Got some lines in mind so I song write

[Pre Hook]
Just a day in the life of a true born hustler
Just a day in the life, a day in the life
Mhmm
Just a day in the life of a bitch that loves to work
Just a day in the life, a day in the life

[Hook]
When I roll out of my bed
I think 'what do I wanna do today?'
I can do anything
I could jump on a jet plane
I'm thinking 'what do I wanna do today?'
And when I run out of my meds
I think do I really wanna call 'em in?
I can do anything
I could jump off a jet plane
I'm thinking you have no say in how I live

[Verse 2]
Oh my God I woke up at 3 o' clock
In the afternoon, damn that's whatsup
Got no 9 to 5 like a desk job
But I got a desktop with all these songs I just dropped

[Pre Hook]
Just a day in the life of a true born hustler
Just a day in the life, a day in the life
Mhmm
Just a day in the life of a bitch that's bipolar
Just a day in the life, a day in the life

[Hook]
When I roll out of my bed
I think 'what do I wanna do today?'
I can do anything
I could jump on a jet plane
I'm thinking 'what do I wanna do today?'
And when I run out of my meds
I think do I really wanna call 'em in?
I can do anything
I could jump off a jet plane
I'm thinking you have no say in how I live

[Bridge]
Been through phases when I don't sleep at all
Up for days on end with no drugs at all
They all ask what I'm on and I say God
He's the only one that can judge me ya'll
Amen

[Hook]
When I roll out of my bed
I think 'what do I wanna do today?'
I can do anything
I could jump on a jet plane
I'm thinking 'what do I wanna do today?'
And when I run out of my meds
I think do I really wanna call 'em in?
I can do anything
I could jump off a jet plane
I'm thinking you have no say in how I live
