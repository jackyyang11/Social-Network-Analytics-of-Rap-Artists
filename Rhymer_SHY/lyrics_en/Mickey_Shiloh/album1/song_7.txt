Verse 1
Haven’t seen it yet
But I’m getting that
Big dick energy from the way you act
Can’t wait for it
Stay awake for it
I been on my knees
I been praying for it

Chorus
Got nothing to do with size
It’s all in your confidence
Way you out here living your best life
It got me wet wet wet wet
Got nothing to do with size
It’s all in your vibration
Way you out here living your best life
It got me wet wet wet wet
Big dick energy flowing
Big dick energy you got it
Big dick energy overflowing
Big dick energy you got it

Verse 2
Haven’t seen it yet
My imagination is running wild
Oooh said you’re gonna come through
I been needing something new too
And it’s something bout you
Something bout you
Something bout you

Chorus
Got nothing to do with size
It’s all in your confidence
Way you out here living your best life
It got me wet wet wet wet
Got nothing to do with size
It’s all in your vibration
Way you out here living your best life
It got me wet wet wet wet
Big dick energy flowing
Big dick energy you got it
Big dick energy overflowing
Big dick energy you got it
