[Verse 1]
I see that you found somebody new
Well damn then I guess that is good for you
I love it how you tried to let me know gently
Had her open your front door like, yeah bitch I'll be taking his key

[Chorus]
It's funny cause I know you think that I'm obsessed
I'm obsessed with you
Think I can't get better sex, better sex than you
Think you got some magic D, nigga please
I get off better when it comes with batteries

[Verse 2]
You ain't the only one moving on
And all you are to me is another song
I love it how you still answer my calls baby
But I bet that you got me saved under some other caller ID
Hide me

[Chorus]
I know you think that I'm obsessed
I'm obsessed with you
Think I can't get better sex, better sex than you
Think you got some magic D, nigga please
I get off better when it comes with batteries

[Bridge]
When it comes with batteries...
I get off better when it comes with batteries...
I get off better, get off better when it comes with batteries
I get off better, get off better when it comes with batteries

[Chorus]
You think that I'm obsessed
I'm obsessed with you
Think I can't get better sex, better sex than you
Think you got some magic D, nigga please
I get off better when it comes with batteries
