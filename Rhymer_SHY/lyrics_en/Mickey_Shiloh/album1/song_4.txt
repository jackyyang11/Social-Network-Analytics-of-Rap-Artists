Verse 1:
You mad because yo man broke
And you just dropped a single
She bought all your planes tho
But you were never s??
Girl i got the Antidote, ooh
Go ahead you can put on your clothes, (put them back on)
Imma tell a secret, (owhoawhoawhoawo)
Its called hard work, (hoawhoawhoawo hoe)
We should take a moment of silence for all the hustlers
All the single mothers all the money making motherfuckers
That came from nothing that made something (--)

(Hook)
Mad cuz yo man broke, he so broke
Its time to let that nigga go, letm go
Its time to let the world know , letm know
That you got something special , go
Girl i got the Antidote, ooh
Go ahead you can put on your clothes, (put them back on)
Imma tell a secret, (owhoawhoawhoa)
Its called hard work, (hoewhoawhoawo hoe)

Verse 2:
You bought all your plays tho
But you would never say so
We can all be a lil hoeish sometimes
I'm not saying I'm a saint, No!
But i make my own doe, (make my own doe)
And my music is original x2
Business on the down low x2
Who i'm fucking you will never know x2
