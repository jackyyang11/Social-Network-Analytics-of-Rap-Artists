[Verse 1: Mickey Shiloh]
Fucked up tryna put my key in the door no luck
Feels like I'm dyin
Can't see straight seeing things
Wanna call u but my phone died no lie
And I got this other nigga holding all my bags
I told him he can come inside but I don't want that
No I don't want that
Just tell me that you want it back and I'll be right there

[Chorus: Mickey Shiloh]
Ohh you know I still think about it all the time
Boy don't act like it ain't me that stay on your mind
Lay me down take it slow Ima tell you how you want it fck me one more time fck me one more time
Lay me down take it slow Ima tell you how you want it fck me one more time one more time babe


[Verse 2: Rowlan]
One more time you should come on through
I learned some things if its feeling new
Come on over so its face to face
One more time let me have a taste
If it's on your mind you would never say
Thats who you are and your petty ways
Blue bubbles ain't reading read
You don’t reply til the vibe is dead
You piss me off the way you acting dumb
I’ll just roll through like you’re where I’m from
Mad at first now I just need the vibe
Just let me live that one more time
I wanna put you in your place
Wanna remind you how I feel
Wanna leave you walking funny
So your friends can know the deal
I ain't stuck on love
I’m here like shut your mouth
I need that ass up north
But need that head down south
Let’s get it like..


[Chorus: Mickey Shiloh]
Ohh you know I still think about it all the time
Boy don't act like it ain't me that stay on your mind
Lay me down take it slow Ima tell you how you want it fck me one more time fck me one more time
Lay me down take it slow Ima tell you how you want it fck me one more time one more time babe
