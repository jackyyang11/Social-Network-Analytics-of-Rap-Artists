[Admit It]
I drink too much
I don’t tell no one
I think I’m good
I think I should admit it…admit it
Admit it….admit it...
I don’t wanna admit it… admit it
Admit it…admit it
I don’t wanna admit it… admit it
Admit it…you can’t get me to admit it
Admit it…admit it...you can’t get me to admit it
I’ve had too many… I’ve had too much...I’ve had too much…
I admit it to myself when I’m all alone 
It’s hard to hear it from myself though
And when other people point it out, YO I KNOW I KNOW I KNOW I KNOW!!
OH I….Oh I oh I… oh I oh I… oh why oh why?
I don’t wanna admit it… I don’t wanna admit it
No you won’t get me to admit
I just won’t admit it, I’ll never admit it

[Let It Go]
I don’t really know what I feel comfortable talking about right now…
It’s not like I’m not alone, I’m by myself
Maybe I’m just tired, it’s 1 in the morning
(And like I said) I know my friend is texting me cause they’re horny
And really I’m just wasting your time
Over here just speaking my mind on the mic every night
And usually I’m not that high
But sometimes it’s easier to write if I light my pipe
So I light my pipe…

[Hook]
And I let it all go, let it all go, let it all go
I let it all go, let it let it all go
I let it all go, let it let it all go
Gotta let it all go, let it all go, let it all go
I let it all go, let it let it all go
I let it all go, let it let it all go

Let it all go…
