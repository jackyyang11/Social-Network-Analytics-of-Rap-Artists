The piece the chain, the gangsta hats
The alligator shoes with the belts to match
The piece the chain, the gangsta hats
The alligator shoes with the belts to match

[Verse 1: Bun B]
Oh Yes its Bun B with no applause
? like Jaws
The button, the zipper, the squeeze, I ain't got no flaws
You know you got what [?] pause
Up in the ladies room, gettin' it ya'll pause
Caravan,  Benz Cadillac and minivans
Pull the cut up, steady waddup
Ain't no time to nut up
[?]
Cause I let em shut up
Say babe raise that [?] up
Get that face down, jazz up
I can't pass up, AC
Brother glass up why I blast up
Just in case you gassed up [?] to you its all down from here
Get from round from here, Morris Creek
Far as I'm concerned, you need to get from round here
Used to [?] man I'm known to raise the century
Givin' industry enemies infantries infinite  injuries instantly
If its meant to be, these hoes pretend to be
Ain't no sympathy, baby sit back relax you finna see

[Verse 2: Pimp C]
I'm flippin' and grippin'
In this game ain't trippin'
Candy paint on my double O', stars keep drippin'
Fifth wheel bumpin a grill, slightly tinted windshields
With a solid gold [?] cause you know I'm trill
Drop scene sippin' lean, ranchers in my cup
Hit the scene down [?] young playa with big bucks
You can tell that I'm a pimp by the way that I walk
You can tell I'm a player by the way that I talk
You know I'm super fly by the car that I drive
And you know I don't love broads, I'm hollerin' pimp or die
I drink and drive and ask you why you sellin' your snatch
You met your match the day you got too attached with the

[Verse 3: Pimp C]
Pimp C drippin' got the [?]
If you a baller in the south we in yo trunk
-
You ain't ridin' in my Benz if you ain't smokin'
If you a square type chick than get round
Pop that thing and touch the ground
Now get crunk, get buck, and let me see it if you gon' give it up
Tryna' lean in your girl like Dirk Diggler
ATL [?]
You on your job connected [?] dissapear
And three carrot diamonds in my ear
Now I'm daddy, I'm daddy
Grippin' wood it feels good in the caddy
Its '99 we ain't messin' with no rats
Its time to put some real life pimpin' on the track
And bring my money back trick hold up
UGK records know what I'm talkin' bout
Smokin' something for the '99 hold up
You need to get your mind on your money
Get down bout your paper
Down here we ain't makin' hip hop songs know what I'm sayin'
We makin' country rap tunes, so uh separate us from the rest
We grippin' grain down here
