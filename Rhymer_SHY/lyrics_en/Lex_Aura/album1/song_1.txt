[Lex Aura]

Hold it in, just hold it in darling
I've been there girl I've been there before
I know what you're going through baby
And I know that I'm what your looking for
Take it off and take that down
I love it when those hips go round
I love it when you make that sound
I'm so glad you're the one I found
I'm so lost in lust with you baby
Tonight I brought all this love for you baby
Shorty I can never get enough
We should fuck around and get drunk
I know you want it you ain't even gotta front
Girl don't be afraid, of all of those things you've been keeping from me on the low
Don't even deny it cause baby I already know
I know, girl I know it
I know, girl I know it
