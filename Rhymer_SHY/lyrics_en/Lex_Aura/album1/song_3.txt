[Verse 1]
Girl you're way to sexy yea, way to sexy yeah
All this liquor I've been sipping got me empty yeah
Girl I'll take that ass down low
I'll put that ass on the floor
I'll get you out them clothes
Give that ass to destroy
Shorty you need this in your life
I need that in my life
This henny fuck with my mental shorty you can see it in my eyes
Put that lean up all in my Sprite
I've been feigning for you all night

[Chorus]
Girl you know you're bad, you know you're bad I'm trying to make that mine
I can't keep my hands to myself
I wouldn't want to be nowhere else
It's just me and you tonight, get you in the mood tonight
I can't wait to turn you on

[Verse 2]
Sexy can I, pardon my manners
I'm tryna see you shake that ass on camera
Girl that nina do damage
All them bitches stay jealous
Tryna be where that ass is
Tryna get you on the mattress
Girl it's fuck them bitches, girl it's fuck them bitches
They ain't got nothing on you, I'll put some yung lex on you
Shorty you need this in your life
I need that in my life

[Chorus]
Girl you know you're bad, you know you're bad I'm trying to make that mine
I can't keep my hands to myself
I wouldn't want to be nowhere else
It's just me and you tonight, get you in the mood tonight
I can't wait to turn you on
