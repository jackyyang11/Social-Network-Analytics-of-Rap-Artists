[Intro]
Ohhhh (x2)

[Chorus]
All night long you been on it
And I know you want it
Girl I know you horny
All night long you been on it
And I know you horny
And I know you want it

[Bridge]
Come here baby
Give it to me
I promise that I'll be
All that you need
Come here baby
Give it to me
I promise that I'll be
All that you need

[Verse]
We could never know unless we try now
If you really wanna know come and find out
Imma be up all night I'm a night owl
Text me when you're outside, I'll be right out
It's one in the morning
We both grown and don't have no curfew
So what's holding you back from coming
Let's get off of FaceTime
Let's do this tonight
There's no need to waste time
We can do this in real life
So lift up your waistline
Slide it off one time
If you don't want waste time
Just shift it to the side girl

[Hook]
If you're horny, let's do it
Right right right, right now (yeah)
If you want it, then prove it
Right right right, right now

[Verse 2]
Why do you play
Why do you play games with me
Watching you play
Watching you play with it (yeah)
Mi nuh inna nuh play play
Girl this ain't a play thing
Running out of patience
Please don't keep me waiting
Making love to your silhouette
Your body looking like a figurine
Switching position like a figure eight
You bouncing on it like a trampoline
Going forever like infinity
And beyond girl
To the ceiling
Til your legs got no feelings
Til you weak in your knees cause

[Chorus]
All night long you been on it
And I know you want it
Girl I know you horny
All night long you been on it
And I know you horny
Girl I know you want it

[Verse]
We said this weekend
For a couple of weeks now
Can't let one more week pass
We getting so weak now
Been looking but can't touch
It's building the lust up
I know you want it oh so bad babe
We been tryna link up
But our schedules don't seem to
Ever want see us
Fucking the sheets up
Doing gully creepers
Or you down on your knees while
You catching my rebounds
Oh you a freak girl
(Oh you a freak girl)
