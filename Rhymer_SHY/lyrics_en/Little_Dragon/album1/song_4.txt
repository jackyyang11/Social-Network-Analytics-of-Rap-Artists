[Verse 1]
Phantom legs and blinking pigs
Haunting me
My long lost love
And the memories of
You

[Chorus]
These nights are haunting me
I don’t want to run, I don’t want to leave
Now that your standing closer
I don’t want to run, don’t want to leave

[Verse 2]
Was a distant moan
And a smell of home
Haunting me
From the clouds above
Oh, the memory of
You

[Chorus]
Oh these nights are haunting me
I don’t want to run, I don’t want to leave
Now that your standing closer
I don’t want to run, I don’t want to leave

Oh these nights are haunting me
I don’t want to run, I don’t want to leave
Now that your standing closer
I don’t want to run, I don’t want to leave
