[Verse 1]
All you ever dream of is right here, baby
Racing endlessly, well, we're not scared
All you truly want, hey, has come true, baby
Don't let little worries make you blue

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Don't escape love, celebrate
Fading every fear into rainbow tears
For tonight, don't be uptight
Hundred red balloons, see your honour, dear
It's your birthday

[Chorus 1]
Let love drip
Lose your grip
Let love drip
Let love drip

[Verse 2]
Fighting through the storm, well, you're lost here, baby
Chasing every first prize could take years
All you truly wanted is right here, baby
Shadows try to rob you of your thrills

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Don't escape, it must be fate
Better now they're letting your soul go dance divine
Your cheeks blush, don't you miss this rush?
Feel it in your blood, now, it's your time

[Chorus 1]
Let love drip
Lose your grip
Let love drip
Let love drip

[Chorus 2]
Let love drip
Lose your grip
Let love drip
Let love
