[Verse 1]
Sang a lullaby to a butterfly
Child's wide brown eyes, secrets inside
She said, "When I die, become a butterfly
You can flutter and colour in meadows and hills
Beauty gave me the chills
Flyin' on your own, then a thousand mourn
Thousand souls swarmin', thousands were performin'."

[Chorus 1]
Bright white, emerald green
Silk blue, sailin' seas
And the spotted wings
Go, go blow in the wind

[Chorus 2]
Bright white, emerald green
Silk blue, sailin' seas
And the spotted wing
Go, go blow in the wind
Go, go, go, go blow in the wind

[Verse 2]
In their old house, from a lover's mouth
He kept feathered in behind the bamboo screen
She said, "When he died, became a butterfly
He was flutterin', colourin' meadows and hills
Beauty gave us the chills
Flyin' on your own, then a thousand mourn
Thousand souls swarmin', thousands were performin'
Thousand souls swarmin', thousands were performin'."

[Chorus 1]
Bright white, emerald green
Silk blue, sailin' seas
And the spotted wings
Go, go blow in the wind

[Chorus 3]
Bright white, emerald green
Silk blue, sailin' seas
And the spotted wing
Go, go blow in the wind
Go, go
