[Verse 1]
We were so young, it was midsummer
Us imagining, ran to pick flowers
You were my, my only friend
When I moved away, we would write letters
Sweden to Japan, oh, I missed our ways
Remember walking a long way home
Over big rocks, trying to get lost
But we knew the way too well
It was so magic, bliss, it was so hard

[Chorus]
5 years passed
Too bad our friendship did not last
We'd never be quite the same
No, never feel quite the same
5 years passed
Too bad our friendship did not last
We'd never be quite the same
No, never feel quite the same

[Verse 2]
When I came back we were seventeen
We were strangers with some history
As if our secrets weren't told (Wandering home, never checking)
You were girlier, dancing ballet
We had moved planets apart, apart, apart, apart, apart
Moved apart, apart, apart, apart, apart

[Chorus]
5 years passed
Too bad our friendship did not last
We'd never be quite the same
We never feel quite the same
5 years passed
As strangers, we could not match
We'd never be quite the same
No, never feel quite the same

[Interlude]
We were too young, I'm missing our fun
Always imagining, I wanna be back again
Walking through rain clouds, finally I had found my friend
Always imagining, I wanna be back again
