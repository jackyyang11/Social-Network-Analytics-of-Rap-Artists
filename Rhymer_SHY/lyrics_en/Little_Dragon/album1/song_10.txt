I was walking home
Looking at the trees
Got the feeling that they
Were looking back at me

Thoughts that occurred to me not of the usual kind
And I don't take that granted, no
I don't call them mine, I don't call them mine
'Cause in my life things are built on, are built on

(Constant surprises)
Coming my way
Some call it coincidence
But I like to call it fate

(Constant surprises)
Coming my way
Some call it coincidence
But I like to call it fate

The higher forces want to connect
Last night in my dream I was talking to you
You know who you are, were you dreaming too?
'Cause in my life things are built on, are built on

(Constant surprises)
Coming my way
Some call it coincidence
But I like to call it fate

(Constant surprises)
Coming my way
Some call it coincidence
But I like to call it fate

Then on my way home I met this guy
He was not so shy, you know, not that kind
We spoke then suddenly I could read his mind
You think it's mad but I don't fool myself, you think it's odd
'Cause in my life, in my life things are built on, they built on, they built on

(Constant surprises)
Coming my way
Some call it coincidence
But I like to call it fate

(Constant surprises)
Coming my way
Some call it coincidence
But I like to call it fate
