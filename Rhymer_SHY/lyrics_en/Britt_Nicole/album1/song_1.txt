[Verse 1]
I'll be honest with all that I've been through
I've been runnin' after everything but you
And I'll be honest
Nothing satisfies
Like the love I find inside your eyes

[Chorus]
There's nothing sweeter than your love
It's all I want, it's all I need
There's nothing sweeter than your love
You gave it all, poured out for me

[Hook]
So I'm not after the world
I'm after you
So I'm not after the world
I'm after you

[Verse 2]
You were watching
Waiting all this time
While I was searching for something in this life
But there's nothing here that I could find
Like the love I find inside your eyes

[Chorus]
Cause nothing's sweeter than your love
It's all I want, it's all I need
There's nothing sweeter than your love
You gave it all, poured out for me

[Hook]
So I'm not after the world
I'm after you
So I'm not after the world
I'm after you
I'm not runnin' after the world
I'm runnin' after you
So I'm not after the world
I'm only after you

[Chorus]
Nothing's sweeter than your love
It's all I want, it's all I need
There's nothing sweeter than your love
You gave it all, poured out for me
Cause nothing's sweeter than your love
It's all I want, it's all I need
There's nothing sweeter than your love
You gave it all, poured out for me

[Hook]
So I'm not after the world
I'm not after the world
I'm after you
So I'm not after the world
I'm not after the world
I'm after you
