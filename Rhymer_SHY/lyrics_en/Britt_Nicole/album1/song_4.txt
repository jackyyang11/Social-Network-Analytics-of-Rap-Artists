[Verse 1]
I remember the moment
I remember the pain
I was only a girl, but I grew up that day
Tears were falling, I know you saw me
Hiding there in my bedroom
So alone
I was doing my best
Trying to be strong
No one to turn to
That's when I met you

[Chorus]
All this time from the first tear cried
Til' today's sunrise
And every single moment between
You were there
You were always there
It was you and I
You've been walking with me all this time
You've been walking with me all this time

[Verse 2]
Ever since that day
It's been clear to me
That no matter what comes
You will never leave
I know you're for me
And you're restoring
Every heartache and failure
Every broken dream
You're the god who sees
The God who rescued me
This is my story
This is my story

[Chorus]
All this time from the first tear cried
Til' today's sunrise
And every single moment between
You were there
You were always there
It was you and I
You've been walking with me all this time
You've been walking with me all this time

[Bridge]
I hear these people asking me
How do I know what I believe?
Well I'm not the same me
And I saw the proof I need
I felt love, I felt your grace
You stole my heart that day
You've been walking with me all this time

[Chorus]
All this time from the first tear cried
Til' today's sunrise
And every single moment between
You were there
You were always there
It was you and I
You've been walking with me all this time
You've been walking with me all this time

[Outro]
Ever since the first tear cried
It was you, you and I
You've been walking with me all this time
Ever since the first tear cried
It was you, you and I
You've been walking with me all this time
