[Verse 1]
Hey girl in the back of the classroom
Afraid to stand out
So scared that you'll say the wrong thing
So you don't make a sound
Paper planes in the sky crashing one at a time
Praying that they don't land where you hide

[Chorus]
Baby, I've been there
I've seen it all before
Baby, I was you
Hoping for something more
And baby, I promise
Cross my heart that in time
It'll get better, it'll get better

[Hook]
Whoa oh oh
Whoa oh oh
It'll get better
Whoa oh oh
Whoa oh oh
It's gonna get better

[Verse 2]
Hey girl in the back of the classroom
Just be strong
Some days feel like forever
But it won't be long
Until you're sitting on the top of the world
Baby, believe it
Like a paper plane in the sky
You'll fly

[Chorus]
I've been there
I've seen it all before
Baby, I was you
Hoping for something more
Baby, I promise
Cross my heart that in time
It'll get better, it's gonna get better

[Bridge]
I know you're hurting inside
And you just wanna cry
I know your hurting inside, inside yeah
But tell all the shadows goodbye
Show 'em your bright side
I know, I know yeah
It's gonna get better
Just hold on

[Chorus]
Cause baby, I've been there
I've seen it all before
Baby, I was you
Hoping for something more
Baby, I promise
Cross my heart that in time
It'll get better, it's gonna get better yeah

[Hook]
Whoa oh oh
It'll get better
Whoa oh oh
It's gonna get better
Whoa oh oh
It'll get better
Whoa oh oh
It's gonna get better

[Outro]
Hey girl in the back of the classroom
Just be strong
