[Verse 1]
It's a beau-beau-beautiful world we've been given
From the top of the sky to the ocean
I'll never understand it all (understand it all)
It must be supernatural
It's a ma-ma-magical thing, a starry night
Feel, feel so small under a billion lights
Never understand it all (never understand it all)
It must be supernatural

[Chorus]
Amazing life
Amazing life
Flying higher than I've ever dreamed
From the top of the world I could scream
Amazing life
Amazing life

[Verse 2]
It's a colorful, colorful world painted so bright
Gonna walk on air, gonna take flight
I'll never understand it all (never understand it all)
It must be supernatural
I wanna drink, drink, drink every drop of sunshine
Got a smile on my face, I won't apologize
I'll never understand it all (never understand it all)
It must be supernatural

[Chorus]
Amazing life
Amazing life
Flying higher than I've ever dreamed
From the top of the world I could scream
Amazing life
Amazing life

[Verse 3]
You're the burning in my heart that never dies, never dies
Without you here, my world is black and white, black and white
Like a show without a stage
Like a storm without the rain
You are the one I can't replace
Need you by my side
Need you by my side

[Chorus]
Amazing life
Amazing life
Amazing life
Amazing life
Amazing life
Amazing life
Flying higher than I've ever dreamed
From the top of the world I could scream
Amazing life
Amazing life
Amazing life
Amazing life
