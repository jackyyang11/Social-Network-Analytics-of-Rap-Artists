[Child and Mother Talking]

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I gotta go to work
I be thinking 'bout you all day
I be thinking 'bout you in the studio
Be thinking 'bout you on the stage
I was wishing I was holdin' you
Wishing I was singing you to sleep
Thinking about you all the time, everyday, all night, all my life

[Hook]
I don't wanna miss nothin'
I don't wanna miss nothin', nothin'
I don't wanna miss one smile, one cry
I don't wanna miss one smile, one cry
I don't wanna miss nothin'
I don't wanna miss nothin', nothin'
I don't wanna miss one smile, one cry
I don't wanna miss nothin', nothin', no

[Pre-Chorus]
When you look back, I know you will remember
That I did it all for you

[Chorus]
I'll give you all my love
I'll give you all my heart
All day, all night, for life, forever, always
I'll give you all my love
Gonna give you all my heart
All day, all night, for life, forever, always
Oh, oh, woah
All day, all night, forever and always
Oh, oh, woah
All day, all night, forever, and always
Always

[Verse 2]
Every single second life goes by
I just wanna be by your side
That's what I'm feelin' tonight
That's what I'm feelin' tonight
Sometimes I look into your eyes
You're a miracle, and you are mine
You're a beautiful life, you're a beautiful life
Yeah

[Hook]
I don't wanna miss nothin'
I don't wanna miss nothin', nothin'
I don't wanna miss one smile, one cry
I don't wanna miss one smile, one cry
I don't wanna miss nothin'
I don't wanna miss nothin', nothin'
I don't wanna miss one smile, one cry
I don't wanna miss nothin', nothin', no

[Pre-Chorus]
With the strength, you give me to move mountains
And fight lions, I'll do it for you

[Chorus]
I'll give you all my love
I'll give you all my heart
All day, all night, for life, forever, always
I'll give you all my love
Gonna give you all my heart
All day, all night, for life, forever, always
Oh, oh, woah
All day, all night, forever, and always
Oh, oh, woah
All day, all night, forever, and always
Always, yeah

[Bridge]
Sometimes I look into your eyes
And I see mine, and it's a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful life!

[Chorus]
I'll give you all my love
I'll give you all my heart
All day, all night, for life, forever, always
I'll give you all my love
Gonna give you all my heart
All day, all night, for life, forever, always
Oh, oh, woah
All day, all night, forever, and always
Oh, oh, woah
All day, all night, forever, and always

[Outro]
I will be there for you
I will be there for you, you ain't gotta go anywhere
I will be there for you
When I can't I know that God will be holdin' you!
All day all night, forever
And always
Always...
