[Intro]
Yeah baby, come here
See I like this
Something just for us to slow dance to
C'mon

[Verse #1]
Come here darling
Come and dance with me
I want to know how it feels to slow dance

[Bridge]
Wrap your arms around my neck
And i'll place mine on your side
Baby we can slow dance
Till the end of the night

[Chorus]
Baby let's slooooow dance
Baby let's slow dance like it like it's our last dance
Let's slooooow dance my dear
Baby lets slow dance like it's our last dance

(Verse #2)
Come closer, darling
I want to feel on your curves in motion
You and meee on this dance floor girl
Baby let our love go unspoken

[Bridge]
Wrap your arms around my neck
And i'll place mine on your side
Baby we can slow dance
Till the end of the night

[Chorus]
Baby let's slooooow dance
Baby let's slow dance like it like it's our last dance
Let's slooooow dance my dear
Baby lets slow dance like it's our last dance yeeah

So I can wrap my arms around you sugar
And slow dance
