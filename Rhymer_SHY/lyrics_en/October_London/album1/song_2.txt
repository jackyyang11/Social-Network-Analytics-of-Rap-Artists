Oh.  Good evening, baby
Don’t you go nowhere
See, I got some things in store for you
You ain’t wanna go nowhere baby
See, you might as well turn your cell phone off
And take your heals off and get comfortable

Yeah I got some stuff right here
It goes a little something like this

Ooooooooh
My sweet love
Ahhhhhhh
Tonight’s the night we make sweet love

Something about your kiss
That keeps me, alive
Naaaaa, naaaaa

That nectar on your sweet lips
That honey’s so fly, so fly

Ooooooooh
My sweet love
Ahhhhhhh
Tonight’s the night we make sweet love

Ooooooooh
Ahhhhhhh

You say it’s something about my arms
When I hold you, real tight
Real tight

You say it’s something about my charm
That makes you take off your clothes at night
Night

Ooooooooh
My sweet love
Ahhhhhhh
Tonight’s the night we make sweet love

Ooooooooh
Ahhhhhhh
