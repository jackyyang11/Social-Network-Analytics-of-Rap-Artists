[Marvin Gaye's Cloe's Apt. sample plays throughout]

[Verse 1]
Go ahead and load the gun
And shoot the messenger baby
I may be the only one to speak my mind, Oh

[Hook]
See it's your ignorance and your lies
And the time you spend hating on one another
You so ignorant, oh
That builds a weakened fence
Stop and lodge waiting on a chance
To love someone that don't see color ooh, aah

[Verse 2]
My brother don't judge me for who I am
And sista don't shame me for who I trust
Who are you to say I'm misguided and misled?
Who are you to judge me for who's in my bed?
Col-

[Chorus]
Colorblind x5
Oh colorblind
To your bullshit I'm-
Colorblind x5
Oh, to the foolishness, oh
We were all made in God's image
We're all children of the earth, ooh
So why in the hell are we (why-why-why?)
Tearing down one's self-worth? Ooh

[Verse 3]
They say the reason for these problems
Are because of people like you and me
They say we weren't made for each other
That our love is blasphemy ooh

[Hook]
See it's your ignorance and your lies
And the time you spend hating on one another
You so ignorant, oh
That builds a weakened fence
Stop and lodge waiting on a chance
To love someone that don't see color ooh aah

[Verse 4]
What difference does it make, whether our families approve?
Whether its right or wrong
Only we shall choose
I've never loved anybody like I loved you baby
And I don't think I ever will

[Chorus]
Colorblind x5
Oh colorblind
To your bullshit I'm-
Colorbind x5
Ooh, to the foolishness oh
We were all made in God's image
We're all children of the earth
So why in the hell are we (why-why-why?)
Tearing down one's self-worth? Oh oo oh
