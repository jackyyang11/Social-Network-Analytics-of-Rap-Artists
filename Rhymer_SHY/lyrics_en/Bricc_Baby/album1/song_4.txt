Yeah little dreaming got a dream

You say you got that rent for me you ain’t got a jingle
I got a [?] from [?] bought a Jag with G
Diamonds like a fridge they like a fridge
All these diamonds piece got a n*gga freeze

I got 84 gold stashed up in the trunk make it dump

N*ggas trying to ride they got no ride
I get them across the border get whatever you order
I got [?] I got [?]
