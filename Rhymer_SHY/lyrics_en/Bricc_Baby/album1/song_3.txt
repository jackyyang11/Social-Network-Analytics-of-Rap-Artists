[Intro: Bricc Baby]
Yeah yeah, yeah
Bricc baby, damn
Fuck-beezy, what it do?
Damn, damn, ooh, ey

[Verse 1: Bricc Baby]
They like daaamn
Shitty pulled up in a Lamb
He ain’t even have no bitch
Man that nigga pulled up outside
Like ‘yaaah’, you can tell he gettin’ cash, I’m the man
Nigga, hundreds wrapped in a rubber band
Mr. T with the chain, gold grams
Like daaamn, man I heard he move coke like the 80’s
And his dope make the fiends go crazy
And everything he rock, man it gotta be the latest
Like yeaaah, and that shit that he smoke is the greenest
And he even let a bitch taste it
He must do it for the fun ‘cause his life seems amazing

[Hook: Alia Rose & (Bricc Baby)]
I do it for the fun (I do it for the fun)
Counting bands, counting hundreds (I got bands, I got hundreds)
I like being alone (Leave me alone)
Since I’m always on my own
I do it for the fun

[Verse 2: Bricc Baby]
Hold up! Do it for the fun, drop down
Got cash, got money and I got it on my [?]
Fuck a friend, man I’d rather buy a Jag
Cause my momma got caught moving packs
And my daddy said ‘do it for the cash’
I’m the son of a brick, I was born hood-rich
Since a youngin I was blowing money fast
God damn, God damn, God damn
Pull up in that new ‘God damn’
10 racks so they like ‘God damn’
Dope boy, dope boy, yeah I got yams
Pull up to the trap
Nigga, you can get it, I’m the man
Baby, bust it open like you do it for the gram
I fuck her then I kick her out, one lost fan
Might be tighter than a [?], but she know a nigga playing

[Hook: Alia Rose & (Bricc Baby)]
I do it for the fun (I do it for the fun)
Counting bands, counting hundreds (I got bands, I got hundreds)
I like being alone (Leave me alone)
Since I’m always on my own
I do it for the fun

[Bridge: Alia Rose]
Chose a hell of a life
Imma live it right
I don’t give a damn what they talk
Cause they still gon’ talk
Chose a hell of a life
Imma live it right
I don’t give a damn, don’t
Don’t give a damn

[Verse 3: Bricc Baby]
That ‘no fucks given’
California ‘rari and the roof fucking missing
200 on the dash oh my God, they screaming ‘good riddance’
No he didn’t, no he didn’t
Shout out all the fucking niggas
That said I wouldn’t be shit
Now I’m at the top, nigga yeah I’m penthouse living
Y’all playing with them niggas, y’all just paying for them bitches
I been playing with them bitches
And the nigga still with the niggas, still with the business
Yeah I do it for the fun
My two daughters and my son
And I never leave the house nigga, without my muthafucking gun

[Hook: Alia Rose & (Bricc Baby)]
I do it for the fun (I do it for the fun)
Counting bands, counting hundreds (I got bands, I got hundreds)
I like being alone (Leave me alone)
Since I’m always on my own
I do it for the fun
