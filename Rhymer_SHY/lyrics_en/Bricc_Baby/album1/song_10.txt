[Verse 1]
If I see a stack, I’ma get it
Shitty be running the city
Got OD engineering
Extorting these niggas, I’m serious
I need my racks and that’s period
Fuck a bad bitch on her period
It ain’t no horse or no chariot
Bitch i’m a pimp, I ain't hearing it
You know I’ma beast in the trap
Booted off Hannah Montana, my trap go bananas
Run through that pack like a savage
Run through them racks like a savage, you know that I’m havin'
Four fingers right on my lap, riding through (?)
Nigga you know that I’m packing
Shot him two times in his back
Nigga he asked me what’s brackin'

You know I’m blue ragging, you know that I’m havin'
