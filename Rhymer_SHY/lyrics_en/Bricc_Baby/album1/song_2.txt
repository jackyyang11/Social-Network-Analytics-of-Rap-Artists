Actavis, Actavis, I'm moving slow-mo
Get a pint then crack the pint, I'm pour another four
That's that Actavis, Actavis, I'm feeling like four
Crack a pint and code a pint, I'm sleepin, no, no, no
Posted on the block with the big .44
Kickin' all these pills, I can't sleep no more
Posted on the block with the big .44
Chewin' on these pills, I don't sleep no more

[Verse 1]
Posted at the spot, all I think about is dough
If you ain't buyin' drugs, why the fuck you callin' my phone?
If you tryna rob me, leave a tag on your toe
Shitty Pistol Pete, man I keep a .44
Nigga know I cop 40
How about the car and the blunt
I do not ride, I'm a (?)
Just hop straight out the Porsche
Man I'm a fool with the torch
I run 'em down with that torch
I run 'em down with that torch
I'ma skirt off in the Porsche
Copped me some Act', pour a four, ayy
Put me a stash in the door, ayy
Put me a stash in the floor, ayy
Pull out 100 bands, blow it, ayy
200 pints at your door, ayy
I get this shit by the crate (lean)
I mix that Fanta with grape (lean)
Pour in that lean by the eighth, yeah

[Interlude]
I'm geeked the fuck up right now, six motherfuckin' drugs Geek it up, geek it up, geek it up, I want the Actavis

[Verse 2]
I got the Act' and I know a cap
Sippin' on purp, call it grand-daddy
I keep that stick while I'm in traffic
Hoppin' out grippin' that automatic
(?) that shit automatic
(?) move that big (?)
I put them blocks in the Trans-Am
You try to rob, switch go bam-bam
I'm loaded, I'm loaded, I know I am
I mix the Perc with the damn Zan
I'm booted, I'm Mollied, at the same time
I'm on the same drugs that killed Yams
Twenty ounce only, can't miss again
I get them bricks from a Mexican
Posted on block for the handle hand
Trap in the mirror get African
(?) then painkiller
Bitches came in (?)
Boxes came in and I stamped them
Right to the left, they can't stand it
I (?) my Cartier pink
So many drugs, don't see
My diamonds, they dancin' like Breezy
My diamonds on water, no Fiji
