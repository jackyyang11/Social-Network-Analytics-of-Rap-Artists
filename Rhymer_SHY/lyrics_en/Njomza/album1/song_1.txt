[Verse 1]
How did we get to this place boy
I'm so bored
You suck me dry, I'm fully drained
Can't take it anymore
Rest assured I at least know now
All the words that come out your mouth
They're like fairy tales

[Chorus]
No sleeping beauty
No glass shoe
Just lost time, trust issues
No knight in armor, no superman
Just a sad excuse, I cut my baggage loose
No sleeping beauty
No glass shoe
Just lost time, trust issues
No knight in armor, no superman
You do everything you can but

[Verse 2]
I'm sorry if I seem a bit too real for you
That's something that you should try see right through you
Your facade and all the shows but you had me fooled
And you deserve an award for that 5-star performance
Had them other girls tricked
One day they all gon' notice that

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no sleeping beauty
No glass shoe
Just lost time, trust issues
You do everything you can

[Chorus]
No sleeping beauty
No glass shoe
Just lost time, trust issues
No knight in armor, no superman
Just a sad excuse, I cut my baggage loose
No sleeping beauty
No glass shoe
Just lost time, trust issues
No knight in armor, no superman
You do everything you can

[Bridge]
Maybe you should let it go
Making it worse for yourself
I'm not your baby girl
Stuck in a fantasy world
See there's consequences and imperfections
Sometimes you can't come clean of the damage
So stay awake, you should pay attention
It's easy to be fooled

[Chorus]
No sleeping beauty
No glass shoe
Just lost time, trust issues
No knight in armor, no superman
Just a sad excuse, I cut my baggage loose
No sleeping beauty
No glass shoe
Just lost time, trust issues
No knight in armor, no superman
You do everything you can
