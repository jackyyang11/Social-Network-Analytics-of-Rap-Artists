Hey there, I've been watching you for quite some time
I see a different world in you, a brand new light
Be my escape, take me away
Just you and me
You and I

He's the one he can save me from myself
Want you for me nobody else
Be my escape, take me away
Won't you bring me to life
Bring me to life

Bring to life x2

You're the only one x6

With out you I can't breathe
With out you I can't see
With out you I'm not me
Baby
With out you I can't breathe
With out you I can't see
With out you I'm not me
No, I'm not me

Bring me to life x3
