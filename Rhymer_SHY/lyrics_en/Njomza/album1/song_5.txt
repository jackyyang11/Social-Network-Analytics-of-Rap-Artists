[Intro]
What is it? What is it?

[Verse 1]
I've fallen weak, so dangerous (So dangerous)
It's way too real, appear too real (You're way too real)
I'm drawn to this, I'll never miss (I'll never miss)
Nothin' to fear when you are near (What is it? What is it?)

[Chorus]
Happenin' to me, I just needed peace
You came from my dreams to reality, my reality
Happenin' to me, I just needed peace
You came from my dreams to reality, my reality

[Post-Chorus]
All this time
I feel alive
What is it? What is it?

[Verse 2]
I might belong, I might be wrong (I might be wrong)
It's what I need, I plant a seed (I plant a seed)
Magical place, don't count the daze (Don't count the daze)
Nothin' to fear, when you are near (What is it? What is it?)

[Chorus]
Happenin' to me, I just needed peace
You came from my dreams to reality, my reality
Happenin' to me, I just needed peace
You came from my dreams to reality, my reality

[Post-Chorus]
All this time
I feel alive

[Outro]
All-all-all-all
This-this-this-this
Time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time
All-all-all-all
This-this-this-this
Time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time
