[Chorus]
I don't know why I’m holdin' on
Playing you like my favorite song
I know it's messed up, I know it’s wrong
To go on like this

[Verse 1]
I wish it was simple
I wish that we could stay in love but I tried to forgive you
I saw within you, I found my way out
Wish we could keep it simple
It's not for real, it's just for you
In the time that I lose you, used as if you boo
I'm running solo, on my way solo

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, we all change and I don't know why
Love turns to distance, strangers over time

[Chorus]
I don't know why I'm holdin' on
Playing you like my favorite song
I know it’s messed up, I know it’s wrong
To go on like this

[Verse 2]
I don't need anybody just there
Don’t wanna put in effort, don't care
Assume that I'm gon' always be there
Like I’d forget the shade, it don't fade
It only growin' out, it's all gray
The light is dim but blood is thin
The seconds feel like centuries
I have no words, so much in me

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, we all change and I don't know why
Love turns to distance, strangers over time

[Chorus]
I don't know why I'm holdin' on
Playing you like my favorite song
I know it's messed up, I know it's wrong
To go on like this

[Outro]
I'm supposed to walk away like nothing ever happened
