You don't gotta lie to me
What you trying to prove
Tellin' me you would die for me
You're just another dude
Now be smart baby
Stay away baby
Tellin me that I'm difficult
That you can't get through
To me but I'm just holding off
From only hurting you
Now be smart baby
Stay away baby

[Hook]
Dont say a word
Be my listener tonight
All that i have seen
You will see tonight
Yeah we fucked up
But dont it feel so right
So right so right

I feel it in my blood now
Temperature has gone up
Running through my veins
All i need is love
Your love your love
All i need is love
Your love your love

[Hook]
Don't say a word
Be my listener tonight
All that i have seen
You will see tonight
Yeah we fucked up
But dont it feel so right
So right so right

I'm stuck in this dream
Life ain't what it seems
Hard to comprehend
Ima ride it til the end

[Hook]
Don't say a word
Be my listener tonight
All that i have seen
You will see tonight
Yeah we fucked up
But dont it feel so right
So right so right
