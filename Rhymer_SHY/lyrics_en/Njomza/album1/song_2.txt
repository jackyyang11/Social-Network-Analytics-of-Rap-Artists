Told you i was trouble
Stay away from me
When you're seeing double
You wanna get to me
And i don't mind
For the time being i enjoy your presence
The feeling of your essence
But the second you leave
I come back down to my senses

I could teach you a lesson or two
How to touch your girl right
Burn her up inside
Let her body ignite
Let her body climb
Until shes high

[hook]
I'm not the type to fall in love
Sadly i don't give a fuck
You'll remember me always
You can never get enough
You're in love, i'm in lust
Baby me you can't trust
I don't wanna break you down
Down down
I don't wanna break you down
Down down down down

I've been through this one too many times
Heard one too many lies
I'm warning you please don't even try
I'm a monster in disguise
I'll devour you
Spit you out
Leave you cold
Laying on the floor
Let you in
Then push you out
And then i'll shut my door

Me you can't adore
I swear i've lost my soul
Me you can't adore
I've lost my soul

[hook]
I'm not the type to fall in love
Sadly i don't give a fuck
You'll remember me always
You can never get enough
You're in love, i'm in lust
Baby me you can't trust
I don't wanna break you down
Down down
I don't wanna break you down
Down down down down

I said i was trouble
My cup full i'm sippin'
My hearts a black tunnel
I know that i'm sinnin'
But this game i'm winnin'
You won't catch me slippin'
My mind set is shiftin'
I've been thinkin' different
Don't care about feelings
Drink til i'm belligerent
When it gets too serious
My first thought is dippin'
So ima go because
I've lost my soul

[hook]
I'm not the type to fall in love
Sadly i don't give a fuck
You'll remember me always
You can never get enough
You're in love, i'm in lust
Baby me you can't trust
I don't wanna break you down
Down down
I don't wanna break you down
Down down down down
