[Verse 1]
Time after time, you're still on my mind
I can feel you in the summertime every time the sun shines
I was so broken but now I'm good as new
I was missing a few a screws, one of them was you

[Pre-Chorus]
You fell in a black hole
And you never came up, never came up
Never came up, never came up
It felt just like home
And now I'm yellin' "come back", yellin' "come back"
Yellin' "come back", yellin' "come back"

[Chorus]
Can you hear me?
I can't, I can't
I can't, I can't, I can't get over you
Can you hear me?
I won't, I won't
I won't, I won't, I won't stop loving you

[Verse 2]
I felt so complete when your skin was on me
Now I hold my breath and clench my teeth ' cause I want you to see
That I'm all grown up and I deserve your love
This ain't over, this ain't done 'til I say so

[Pre-Chorus]
You fell in a black hole
And you never came up, never came up
Never came up, never came up
If felt just like home
And now I'm yellin' "come back", yellin' "come back"
Yellin' "come back", yellin' "come back"

[Chorus]
Can you hear me?
I can't, I can't
I can't, I can't, I can't get over you
Can you hear me?
I won't, I won't
I won't, I won't, I won't stop loving you
Can you hear me?
I can't, I can't
I can't, I can't, I can't get over you
Can you hear me?
I won't, I won't
I won't, I won't, I won't stop loving you

[Break]
I won't I won't, I won't stop loving you

[Bridge]
Your mind was always gone
I couldn't tell you to stay
What I should've said, what I should've told you
And I know it may be wrong
I should've told you to stay
What I should've said is I can't live without you

[Chorus]
Can you hear me?
I can't, I can't
I can't, I can't, I can't get over you
Can you hear me?
I won't, I won't
I won't, I won't, I won't stop loving you
Can you hear me?
I can't, I can't
I can't, I can't, I can't get over you
Can you hear me?
I won't, I won't
I won't, I won't, I won't stop loving you
