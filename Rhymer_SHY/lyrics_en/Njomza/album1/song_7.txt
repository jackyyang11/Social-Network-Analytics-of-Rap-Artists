Yeah...

[Verse 1]
You tell me that you wanna go
'Cause I don't think I can make it without you here
(Oh no, no, no)
Time is moving so slow
Some rass just said I want you near
Smoking the medicinal till we feel invincible
Got no problems, got no fears
Your love is so damn critical
Mentally and physical
Screaming just so you can hear

[Chorus]
How much I adore you
I want to explore you
Want our souls to collide
With our bodies, free and wild
Baby let me show you
Just want I can do
I can teach you to fly
No more pain and no more cries

[Verse 2]
I believe that I see heaven in your eyes
I found a sense of peace
I think I, I think I, I think I found paradise
Could this be what they call "love"
In a world of sin, we can rise above
You're all that I want to be apart of
I'm a fiend for it, I can't get enough
Every inch and every touch
Can't put it in words just how much
Oh I, oh I, oh I want you all the time
You got me, you got me, you got me so damn hypnotized

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Oh...
Oh I, oh I, oh I
Oh I, oh I, oh I...

Let me hear that

So much trouble in the word (6x)
