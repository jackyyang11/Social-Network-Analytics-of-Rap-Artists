[ALEXANDER HAMILTON]
An open letter to the fat
Arrogant
Anti-charismatic national embarrassment
Known as President John Adams

[ENSABLE VOICE]
Shit

[ALEXANDER HAMILTON]
The man's irrational
He claims that I'm in league
With British in some vast international intrigue?
Bitch please!

You wouldn't know what I'm doin'
You're always goin' berserk
But ya never show up to work
Give my regards to Abigail
Next time you write about my lack of moral compass
At least I do my job upon in this rumpus

The line is behind me
I crossed it again while the president lost it again
Aw, such a rough life
Better run to your wife
Now the boss is in Boston again
Let me ask you a question.
Who sits at your desk when you're in Massachusetts?
They were calling you a dick back in '76
And you haven't done anything new since
You're a nuisance with no sense

You'll die of irrelevance
Go ahead, you can call me the devil
You aspire to my level
You inspire to malevolence
Say, "Hi", to the Jeffersons!

And spies all around me
Maybe they can confirm
I don't care if I kill my career with this letter
I'm confining you to one term
You fat mother-----!
