[Lin Manuel-Miranda]
There's nothing Americans love more
Than posting online who you should vote for
You're tweeting, you're snapping, you're gawk
But if you don't show up and vote it's all just talk
Take a little time on November 8th
To do your civic duty and renew your faith
And the nation your on, let them know the truth
The room where it happens is the voting booth
So...
