[Verse 1]
Wasted heart
When you left me, you left me with no choice
I'm looking for a boy to fill this empty void
Kiss the old me goodbye she's dead and gone, dead and gone, oh
Wasted heart
You took the last bit of love I've ever had
You took a good girl and you turned me oh so bad
Kiss the old me goodbye she's dead and gone, dead and gone, oh

[Chorus]
All hands on deck
One in the back, two in the front, just like that, like that
I'mma blow your mind, take it out on the floor like that, like that
One in the back, two in the front, just like that, like that
I'mma blow your mind like that
All hands on deck
One in the back, two in the front, just like that, like that
I'mma blow your mind, take it out on the floor like that, like that
One in the back, two in the front, just like that, like that
I'mma blow your mind like that

[Verse 2]
Wasted heart
Done here's to death do us apart
I watch you fold like a house of cards
Kiss the old me goodbye she's dead and gone, dead and gone, dead and gone, yeah
One by one, I watch you fall down, watch you fall like dominoes
Take no prisoners, search and destroy
Baby look at what you've done
One by one, I watch 'em go down, watch 'em fall like dominoes
Watch 'em go down, watch 'em go down, watch 'em go down

[Chorus]
All hands on deck
One in the back, two in the front, just like that, like that
I'mma blow your mind, take it out on the floor like that, like that
One in the back, two in the front, just like that, like that
I'mma blow your mind like that

[Bridge: Instrumental]

[Chorus]
All hands on deck
One in the back, two in the front, just like that, like that
I'mma blow your mind, take it out on the floor like that, like that
One in the back, two in the front, just like that, like that
I'mma blow your mind like that
All hands on deck
One in the back, two in the front, just like that, like that
I'mma blow your mind, take it out on the floor like that, like that
One in the back, two in the front, just like that, like that
I'mma blow your mind like that
