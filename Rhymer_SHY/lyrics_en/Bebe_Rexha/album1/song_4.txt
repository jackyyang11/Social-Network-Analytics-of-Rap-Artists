[Intro]
Shoutout to Lauren cause she said it right
That thing, that thing
He just wanna bite

[Verse 1]
Don't let him hit it and quit it
If he hits it and quits it
You probably won't see him no more, no more
And i hate to admit it, i hate to admit it
But i've been that girl once before
I ain't to worry bout that

[Pre-Chorus]
East coast till I die
But the west coast I reside
And my momma told me right
She said just remember you're the

[Chorus]
Apple at the top of the tree
Don't give it away so easily
Don't give it away so easily
One day he'll climb up to get that
Apple at the top of the tree
Don't give it away so easily
Don't give it away so easily
One day he'll climb up to that apple baby
That apple baby, that apple baby

[Verse 2]
Don't let him hit it and quit it
Girl, you're so caught up in it
You don't see how special you are, you are
And if you let him hit it, if you let him hit it

I told you straight from the start

[Pre-Chorus]
East coast till I die
But the west coast I reside
And my momma told me right
She said just remember you're the

[Chorus]
Apple at the top of the tree
Don't give it away so easily
Don't give it away so easily
One day he'll climb up to get that
Apple at the top of the tree
Don't give it away so easily
Don't give it away so easily
One day he'll climb up to that apple baby
That apple baby, that apple baby
