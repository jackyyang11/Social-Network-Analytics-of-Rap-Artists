I'm a straight shoot up with bang bang bang bang bang bang
You tryna hit me with your ride hood
Tryna sell me fame
I'm a lone ranger, I'm a smoke you out
Sugar, I'ma show you what I'm all about

Locks up, two smoking arrows
See that shit straight like a broken arrow
Cause I know, I know your hand and I called you bluff

And I don’t wanna know the reasons why
I don’t wanna know you deep inside
And I don’t wanna hear the twisted lie
Don't know this is my battle cry
This is my battle, this is my battle cry
This is my battle, this is my battle cry

I'mms straight shoot up with bang bang bang bang bang bang
Gonna give you a taste of your own medicine
I'm working with my last ounce, gotta reel you in
And switch you like tobacco, cause you burn like chin

Locks up, two smoking arrows
See that shit straight like a broken arrow
Cause I know, I know your hand and I called you bluff

And I don’t wanna know the reasons why
I don’t wanna know you deep inside
And I don’t wanna hear the twisted lie
Don't know this is my battle cry
This is my battle, this is my battle cry
This is my battle, this is my battle cry

You don't need attraction now
And I watch you, your walls come down
Surrender your weapons now
Surrender your weapons now
Surrender your weapons now

And I don’t wanna know the reasons why
I don’t wanna know you deep inside
And I don’t wanna hear the twisted lie
Don't know this is my battle cry
This is my battle, this is my battle cry
This is my battle, this is my battle cry
