[Verse 1]
I needed you like the stars need the night
But you left me in the dark, here to die
And we had something that money could never buy
But you ruined it with all your twisted lies

[Pre-Chorus]
Push through the storm, baby push through the pain
Dust myself off and stay in the game
Won't let you tell me, tell me I'm out
I am the queen and this is my crown
I am a fighter, I'm the igniter
I'm gonna light your whole world on fire
I wanna thank you for making me so much stronger

[Chorus]
Bad bitches don't cry
We just get even, even
So raise your fist, raise them to the sky
Baby keep believin'-lievin'
And if there's one thing that I've ever learned
It's that if you play with fire, you're bound to get burned
But bad bitches don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry

[Verse 2]
I bet you thought I'd be nothing without you
But you thought wrong cause baby I am bulletproof

[Pre-Chorus]
Push through the storm, baby push through the pain
Dust myself off and stay in the game
Won't let you tell me, tell me I'm out
I am the queen and this is my crown
I am a fighter, I'm the igniter
I'm gonna light your whole world on fire
I wanna thank you for making me so much stronger

[Chorus]
Bad bitches don't cry
We just get even, even
So raise your fist, raise them to the sky
Baby keep believin'-lievin'
And if there's one thing that I've ever learned
It's that if you play with fire, you're bound to get burned
But bad bitches don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry
