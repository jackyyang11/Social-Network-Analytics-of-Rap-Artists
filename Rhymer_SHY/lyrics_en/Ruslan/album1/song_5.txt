[Verse 1: Beleaf]
My Ameri, kinda sorta
Like a carnivore, I say we out of order
I just want to eat
And they just want the beef so I serve it well done
They just want the beef so I serve it well done
They just want the beef so I serve it well done
Chef Melanin, roast a barbeque pelican in the fire pit
Kumbaya with 808's is sorta kinda lit
Let's stick our sticks into the fire pit
And then raise them into the sky
And then they will turn in into the torches
Or the lanterns, and we chase after the ones that's in the darkness
Walk in two by twos or four by fours, light up your crosses
See, we don't even need to wear a hoodie no more
What we look like is irrelivant
In the sanctuary is an elephant
Just because I call you my brother
That don't mean that you will not hate my colour
It's out of the ordinary that the order you see me
Is only the way they portray me on TV
See I put my thoughts on CD's
So it beats up on your eardrum
The black man, why you fear them
Your freedom only lasts as long as the echo they hearin'
The same desk I wrote this verse on, I got from pier one
Could have been made from the same wood ancestors hung from from
Oh, don't you find that ironic oh
Don't you find that bubonic oh
I got to run fast like Sonic
Still got slave masters on my money
Go outside, it's not sunny
I really wonder what they want from me
I hope they get a chance to hear my heart speak
Cause all we got in common is the heartbeat
All we got in common is the heartbeat
All we got in common is the heartbeat
