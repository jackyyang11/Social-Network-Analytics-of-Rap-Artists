[Hook: Dom Marcel]
You're something like a summer breeze
Moving through the eucalyptus trees
The taste of Holiness like, like
Like Heaven’s honeycomb drop up on my tongue yeah

[Verse 1: Ruslan]
I need to speak my peace
I need to speak my due
I need to beat the beast
I need to tame the bull
I stood in line for swine
And I still cast my pearls
I used to go to church for girls
And realized the hurtful world was even there
And know I can't escape it but you everywhere
And now I know I'm not alone
My wife is here, my niece is here
My sister's here, they're tryna go
I'm running late, my stomach folds
I curl up, I'm tryna hurl
I stuck it up
It's funny cause I still go to church for girls
Grateful for my wife's patience
I could go from over-working
To living life on vacation
I tend to be extreme
She sees and gives me balance
I seem to find the challenge
WIth turning off these cameras and these screens
Far from perfect but I still believe
That God is who he says he is
And I am just a seed like my son
Interruptions well received when they come
Ain't rich, ain't perfect
But I'm glad what we've become
Yeah

[Hook: Dom Marcell]
Yeah you bring me to life
When you show me the light
Yeah you bring me to life
When you show me the light
There's nothing sweeter than you

[Verse 2: Ruslan]
We're starting to have these talks
More frequent than just in song
I'm thinking it won't be long
I'm living out what you taught
That El Shaddai, Adonai
