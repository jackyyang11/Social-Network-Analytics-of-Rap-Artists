[Pre-Chorus: WHATUPRG]
I know what it like to have no options
I know what it like to be alone
I know what it like to pick yo' pockets
And not even a dime to call your own

[Chorus: WHATUPRG]
No, God only knows
I've been through highs and the lows
I've been down, down, down before
I been, I been through hell and back and the flow still cold
I been through hell and back and the flow still cold
I been through hell and back and the flow still cold
I been through hell and back and the flow still cold
I been through hell and back and the flow still

[Verse 1: Ruslan]
Confetti flew, red balloons, when Givez left
Accelerated, plottin,' plannin' my ill death
Ha, funny how things work
I can't attach another man to my worth now
I'ma make it worthwhile, never been burnt out
Oh, they think I fell off, always [?] the first
I don't need no favors from you
I don't wanna be neighbors with you
Politics is hallowist, I guess that's what fame will get you
Forgive me I'm a rider, but still I'm just a simple man
All I want's the money, skip the fame I'm a simple man
I can take some Ls, best believe 'cause a winner can
Overcome any obstacle that's in front of him
I can't even with you simpletons being slick again
Cali boy but colder than the winter of Lake Michigan
Oh, we doin' this again? Think we doin' this and that?
If I was into dissin' cats you would feel the dissonance

[Pre-Chorus: WHATUPRG]
I know what it like to have no options
I know what it like to be alone
I know what it like to pick yo' pockets
And not even a dime to call your own

[Chorus: WHATUPRG]
No, God only knows
I've been through highs and the lows
I've been down, down, down before
I been, I been through hell and back and the flow still cold
I been through hell and back and the flow still cold
I been through hell and back and the flow still

[Verse 2: Ruslan]
50 said "Get rich or die tryin'"
But bein' rich ain't never defined who I am
I'm buildin' wealth, then take it back to Zion
I gotta do it, never had any time for tryin'
I close my eyes, blackout, but I'm never dyin'
Then open wide, so shocked, like look where I am
Stop and go, only two speeds that I have ever known
Pedal home, I actually believe all these things I spoke
Seen the bottom, so in comparison
I cannot acknowledge anything I'm facing today as a real problem
Still solved it, despite who my God is still callin,' still sovereign
Back to the genesis like I'm Phil Collins
So can you feel it in the air, tonight the Fahrenheit is
Elevated, levitated, never been afraid to fight
Always down to pay the price for success I made it like
My terms, my terms, talk about a change in life

[Pre-Chorus: WHATUPRG]
I know what it like to have no options
I know what it like to be alone
I know what it like to pick yo' pockets
And not even a dime to call your own

[Chorus: WHATUPRG]
No, God only knows
I've been through highs and the lows
I've been down, down, down before
I been, I been through hell and back and the flow still cold
I been through hell and back and the flow still cold
I been through hell and back and the flow still cold
I been through hell and back and the flow still cold
I been through hell and back and the flow still
