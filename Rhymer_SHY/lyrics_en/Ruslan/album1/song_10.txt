I made this to make this to makeshift
But helps me get started
Look I took time to reflect no deflect [?]
I'm on it I'm honest
Amongst other things I could be brash
I guess that's the part my mother brings
My personality could smother things
I come up like I'm being hypnotized to loving things
Look I got no real hobbys
Tryna become number one
I feeling like Ricky Bobby
Shakin' and bacon never fakin' to make it
Achin' and anxious on the inside
Feeling naked and sloppy
Never the less my God got me
Need him now more than ever
Cause together who can stop we
And the gospel is more relevant than it's ever been
For me personally daily I still need it to settle in

Excuse me those aren't cool guy raps
I grew up laughed at where the cool guys at
S A [?] they still tryna bring durags back
In public, debating like where's 2Pac at
If you talking bout molly these aren't cool guy raps
I grew up laughed at where the cool guys at
Never did prescription drugs cause we knew that trap
If you liked to slow down these aren't cool guys rap

I never claimed to know it all
So I only speak on what I know
They rather not be involved
But always wanna pull up to my next shows
Like "Hello can we get up on the guest list?"
Maybe you can get up on the next list
Uh maybe you could go sit up with the extras
Naw I'm just playing cmon baby let's just
Be the change be the change
I ain't tryna be the same
That's not an elitist thing
Yes we all struggle but ain't that the reason Jesus came
Be the change be the change
I'm just tryna be the change
Down a few racks but I'm good cause the freedom came
Cool little [?] aim
You can think it's corny too
What I think is corny is ever being one of you corny dudes
Willfully addicted womanizer adulter
You're youthanising yourself that can never be culture

But all I hear nowadays are these cool guy raps
I grew up laughed at where the cool guys at
You the man you the man where the cool guys at
Oh you came to drop bars with a cool back pack
If you're tryna pop xanz these aren't cool guy raps
Just embrace who you are those are new guy raps
If you're having girl problems those are cool guy raps
Extra emo beating woman yeah let's not do that
Naw cool guy raps
I'm cool off the cool guy raps
Yeah cool guy raps
Look I'm cool off the cool guy raps
For real no cool guy raps
Cool off your cool guy raps
No cool guy raps
Look cool off your cool guy raps
