Chorus (Jet Trouble):
I know that you're waiting for the new stuff it'll come
I think that they hate that I don't care for what they've done
I've moved out the city, now they sound like all my sons
They say they don't love me, but I know they sing along (x2)

Verse 1:
I did it, I did it right
They lookin' out for the new
I told them it's comin' soon
I first gotta get it right
Five AM, I've been up since nine
That's a part of the pedigree
I can't help but to put in time
Clockin' in like i'm Gary V
Clock in, clock out
Yeah you know what I'm about
Gonna reap what I sow even when I'm in a drought
(Skrt skrt)
Pull up unannounced
(Churp churp)
Aww you birds gotta bounce
Child, wow, cur curve finessin' with style
My, child, you a..a..act so wild
Like when I was ten years old
Gettin' faded off the comunion
Munchkins ain't gettin old
But I never stop improvin'
I told you I did it right, I told you I did it right
They stopped while I kept it movin'
Now they watchin' all my maneuvers

Chorus (Jet Trouble):
I know that you're waiting for the new stuff it'll come
I think that they hate that I don't care for what they've done
I've moved out the city, now they sound like all my sons
They say they don't love me, but I know they sing along (x2)

Verse 2:
Middle finger to the industry
While I'm givin' up praises to my God
Might continue to mention me, if you think this thing was never in my odds
Actin like I didn't do didali
Thinking to small, you can never belittle me
Mentally I do not have to kick it, you gettin' that yellow card feelin' the penalty ticket
Get it, It's ok if my goals went over your head
Get it, I put my soul over ever gettin' bread
Live it, Now just talk about it but we can talk about it
All these Superfans I got, all fanatic
And they all sing along all imaginary songs
Of all
The miss inform
The feeling strong
The ceilings gone
My son was born
I gave him life
He gave me more
I raise him right
He can't ignore the fruit
The sight, acquired storm
Raise the price, To change my life
I've been reformed, this ain't to know
I'm dead or alive
Raised with the Christ, So i rise above it
They say they don't like it, but I know they love it

Chorus (Jet Trouble):
I know that you're waiting for the new stuff it'll come
I think that they hate that I don't care for what they've done
I've moved out the city, now they sound like all my sons
They say they don't love me, but I know they sing along (x2)

Harmony (Dom Marcel):
I know they sing along (repeat till the end)
