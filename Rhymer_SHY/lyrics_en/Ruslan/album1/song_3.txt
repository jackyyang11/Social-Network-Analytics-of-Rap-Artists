[Verse 1: Ruslan]
Got so much blood on my hands that my conscience stained
These pages are evidence to confiscate
The crowds gather 'round, wanna congregate
They wanna hear me now and what it is that I can say
To explain myself while I've been  caught red handed
But they slap me on the wrist like I'm Smoky and a Bandit
Like I'm smoking in abandoned buildings
I dismantled, set on fire, then I hitchhike cause I'm really left stranded, poor me
My life's a OD
My life's a high life, for you guys to know me
I'm only so human, Skywalker hold me
Down and don't forget who's Obi-Wan Kenobi
Pour me a drink, help me to think
Show me what's phony the homies didn't offer going
Extinct and the force is leading me to slaughter
The brink, I can't kill this feeling any longer

[Verse 2: Ki'Shon Furlow]
I need a compact, keep me in contact
I been killing before I had me a contract
We can't even converse, let's see some money on it
Never been half-stepping, plenty of sponsors
I be with monsters like Ash Ketchum, strapped all black weapon
Flow so funky I should be giving them jazz lessons
Letterman jacket I'm balling outta my class with it
I hit the stage and move bodies like bad pivots
Wicked
Tell 'em hold up, I'mma roll up
With the homies, with the soldiers
We focused, I told ya
We high off them dreams
When I get tracks, I don't back track
Got a few raps for the backpacks
Get a click-clack, blat, blat, blat
Then right off the scene
Wait
I'm so realer
I grew up with bangers, pimps, and dope dealers
I done travelled all around to give 'em something to hear
I'm tryna tell you that it's not a flow iller
I'm a

[Verse 3: J. Monty]
I think they threatened cause I'm a versatile dude
I might stop your flow my verses hound dudes
I'm so fortunate to be in His will, I don't spend nothing unless I'm purchasing a vowel fool
Surfing through the crowd, searching every smile
Burning every foul, mercenary down
Churches where the sound booms
Lurking in your town, verbally astound
Working with the (pow!)
Blow your mind like the burner in your mouth
I'm that dude that keep vanilla wafers with him
Keep it cooler than your ventilation system
They say that gambling against the Scripture
When I spit it I can make the alphabet that I'mma kill 'em
If I give 'em a hand they gon' turn around put a nail through it
So much fire, Hell owe me like Adele music
Audio murderer get prepared for the funeral
When I'm spitting all the judges say ten, like Lucifer
I'm a
