[Chorus: Jet Trouble]
I've been back against the wall, it ain't nothing new
I know the money's gonna come, we gon' make it through
If they ever had a doubt, then they never knew
That the kid doesn't follow the rules 'cause he's supposed to
Back against the wall, it ain't nothing new
I know the money's gonna come, we gon' make it through
If they ever had a doubt, then they never knew
That the kid doesn't follow the rules 'cause he's supposed to

[Verse 1: Ruslan]
They say they want me to fit in and what they want me to be
But none of this was real, it's like I'm trapped inside a movie
And I've never been the industry guy, but here's a doozy
When you don't play by they rules
That's when the industry comes to me, yeah
Either way, I'm more concerned about bottom line
Than how something may appear to be
'Cause you can't make sense without dollar signs
And you cannot win without honor code
They wonder how do I stay honor roll
They act like they do not be looking, but they keep on looking
It's actually comical
I come from the underground, so all I ever knew was living in dirt
Growing in spurts
Funny that when you stay rooted, you're better at knowing your worth, going berzerk
Whenever they try to downplay you, end of the day
You better know all that you are
They gonna tell you, you odd for followin' dreams that've been on your heart

[Chorus: Jet Trouble]
I've been back against the wall, it ain't nothing new
I know the money's gonna come, we gon' make it through
If they ever had a doubt, then they never knew
That the kid doesn't follow the rules 'cause he's supposed to
Back against the wall, it ain't nothing new
I know the money's gonna come, we gon' make it through
If they ever had a doubt, then they never knew
That the kid doesn't follow the rules 'cause he's supposed to

[Verse 2: nobigdyl.]
Yeah, hm, tribe on the move
I had plans to feed the family, get a check, and then we ball
Seems they had a plan B and they dipped, is that my fault?
Hard to split dividends once division get involved
I hear peace from my right shoulder, other shoulder, kill 'em all
I had my back against the wall, but maybe I could fix this
If I make it my whole mission to forgive and start forgettin'
Opposition don't exist, I found my clique, the indie tribe
Living water hit us and we multiply like we some gremlins
Our co-creators feel more like some Kingsman not to mention
Now our idols hand us pens and say, "Initial by the endin'"
I'ma make you love my darkened pigment by the endin'
I'ma make you truly love our women by the endin'
You might never eat another piglet by the endin'
I'ma make you question your intentions by the endin'

[Chorus: Jet Trouble]
I've been back against the wall, it ain't nothing new
I know the money's gonna come, we gon' make it through
If they ever had a doubt, then they never knew
That the kid doesn't follow the rules 'cause he's supposed to
Back against the wall, it ain't nothing new
I know the money's gonna come, we gon' make it through
If they ever had a doubt, then they never knew
That the kid doesn't follow the rules 'cause he's supposed to
