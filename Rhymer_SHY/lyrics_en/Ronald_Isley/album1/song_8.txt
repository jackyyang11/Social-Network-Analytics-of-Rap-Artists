Yeah, no, no, no
With no chains I could run free
With no pain I'd be happy
With no cash I could follow
With no direction I could follow
But with no you there's no me
No vision, I can't see
Oo, this is how I feel

[Chorus]
Oh, there's a million things that I could do without
But not you, cause if I lose my woman my sun will no longer shine
My poems will no longer rhyme, my... will no longer
If I lose my woman, a heart broke in two
Where am I if I can't find you
So don't let go of my hand, cause it follows my woman

Drifting I'd be so lost, missing I'd be so gone
We might argue but that's all, I don't mean it please call
Me back girl, I miss you, wanna kiss you, can't forget you
This is how I feel

[Chorus]
So take away the home, take the car
But don't take away my superstar
Cause if I lose my girl, it don't matter much what you take from me
As long as you guarantee she won't leave

[Chorus]
No, no, yeah, you know, oh
