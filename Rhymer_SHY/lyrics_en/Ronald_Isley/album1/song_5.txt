Girl, you outdid yourself tonight
Dinner was out of sight
Oh, let's turn some music on
And dim the lights

Oh, but there's one special thing
Honey, that you can do for me
If you don't mind
Girl, if you don't mind
Oh, you're so fine

(Dance for me)
Hey, baby, dance for me, dance for me
(Dance for me)
I want you to dance for me, baby

(Dance for me)
Ooh, dance for me, dance
(Dance for me, dance for me)
Dance for me
(Dance for me, baby)

Oh, baby, don't be shy
It's just you and I
Far away from prying eyes, oh, really
Oh, share your gifts with me exclusively
In complete total privacy

(Dance for me)
Baby, dance for me
(Dance for me)
You know

(Dance for me)
How I want you to dance for me, baby
(Dance for me, dance for me)
(Dance for me, baby)

Dance for me
Dance for me
Dance for me
Dance for me, dance for me
Dance for me, my baby

Dance for me
Dance for me
Dance for me
Dance for me, dance for me
Dance for me, my baby

Dance for me
Dance for me
Dance for me
Dance for me, dance for me
Dance for me, my baby
