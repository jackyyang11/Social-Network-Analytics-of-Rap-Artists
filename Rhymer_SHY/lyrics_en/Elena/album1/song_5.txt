Stripped to the waist, we fall into the river
Cover your eyes, so you don't know the secret
I've been trying to hide, we held our breath
To see our names are written on the wreck of '86

That was the year I knew the panic was over
Yes since we found out, since we found out

That anything could happen, anything could happen
Anything could happen, anything could happen
Anything could happen, anything could happen
Anything could

After the war we said we'd fight together
I guess we thought that's just what humans do
Letting darkness grow, as if we need its palette and we need
Its color
But now I've seen it through and now I know the truth

That anything could happen, anything could happen
Anything could happen, anything could happen
Anything could happen, anything could happen
Anything could

Baby, I'll give you everything you need
I'll give you everything you need, oh
I'll give you everything you need
But I don't think I need you

I know it's gonna be, I know it's gonna be
I know it's gonna be, I know it's gonna be
I know it's gonna be, I know it's gonna be
I know it's gonna be, I know it's gonna be

But I don't think I need you, but I don't think I need you
But I don't think I need you, but I don't think I need you
