[Verse 1]
At First Glance She Really Caught My Eye
I Knew That There Was Somethin'
I Really Had To Figure Out
No Doubt, Your Boy Had Clout
I Heard From The Word
That Your Girl Put It Down
I Seen Her Around
Hesitated To Approach her
Cause I Didn't Know She Was Down With The G'stas
Baby Smokes Reefer Just Like Me
And She Know How To Ride When We Out With The Team
Looking So Clean Keep Her Close When We Ride
Baby Like That Cause She Knows That I Treat Her Right
These Sounds That I Hear When She Approach Me
Make Me Wanna Hit The Lab And Do It All Night
Always Down, Baby's Ready For The Business
Stuck By My Side Through The Good & The Bad Times
I Don't Know What I Would Do If She Wasn't Around
She Could Really Make A Good Clown Frown

[Chorus]
(When The Stars Come Out At Night)
Okay Yeah This Is Real Deep Right Here
(When The Stars Come Out At Night)
Okay Okay
(Neptune)
Yeah Lets Go
That’s How I Feel
(Is Falling From The Sky)
Its Fallin' Homie
(All That’s Left Is My Heart)
To Me Its Real Dear To Me
(I Start To Cry)
Lets Go

[Verse 2]
Take 2, Some Things Are Getting Closer
And A Little Different
But You Gotta Pay Attention
And Went Around Town, That My Girl's Down
Everybody Wanna Know What She All About
But I'm Selfish, I Want Her All To Myself
I Rather Have It My Way, Any Fucking Day
Had To Learn On My Own, Gotta Act Grown
Some Things Don't Change
That’s The Way It Go
So We Got A Coat
Walking On A Tight Rope
Listening To Old Ass Songs On The Radio
Now N Days Baby Girls Getting No Play
Messing With These Broke Down Fools All Day
There's Gotta Be A Way
I Could Have You To My Self
The Way It Was Back Then
Really Felt Right
I Don't Know Maybe I Could Look Up In The Sky
I Need Your Grace And Maybe It'll Be Alright

[Chorus]
(When The Stars Come Out At Night)
Okay This How I Feel Homie
(When The Stars Come Out At Night)
If You Love Music Like I Do
You Love It Homie
You know What I Mean
(Neptune)
You Know Exactly How It Feel
(Is Falling From The Sky)
Yeah Its True Shit Right Here
(All That’s Left Is My Heart)
We Gon' Do It Like This
(I Start To Cry)
Lets Go
