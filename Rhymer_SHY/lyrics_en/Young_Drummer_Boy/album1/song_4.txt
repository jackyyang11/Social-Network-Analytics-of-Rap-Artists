[Chorus]
Homie Roll On
Let Me Get Blown
Feeling Like A Champion
Sittin' On My Throne
Homie Roll Long
Let Me Get Blown
Feeling Like A Champion
Sittin' On My Throne
Homie Roll On
Homie Roll On
Homie Roll On
Le Le Let Me Get Blown
Feeling Like A Champion
Sittin' On My Throne

[Verse 1: Young Drummer Boy]
I Ain't Never Told No Lie Man
But Now I'm Lying
I Ain't Never Seen No Man Cry
But Now I'm Crying
See I'm Searching For That Good Life
Foot Is On The Peddle
I Just Know I'm Meant For Greatness
Man I'm On That Level
Leather On The Inside
Watch Out Where You Ash It
Treat Her Like A Bitch Son
I Will Never Pass It
Metal Plate Up Over My Chest
Is Super Static
Kryptonite Won't Put Me To Rest
It's Made Of Plastic
Yeah, I Stretch My Music Like Elastic
Give It To The People
And They Take It Homie As Is
It's Like Acid
I'm Lost Up In a Daze
High Up As A Motherfucka
Off That Purple Haze
Now I'm Feeling Like Twilight
Starring At The Moon Like
Feeling Like The Moods Right
Puffing On That Wood Pipe
Yeah, See I'm Meant To Be A Champion
Now Strike A Motherfucka Down
Right Where I'm Standing

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Mav Of Sol Camp]
Man Sometimes I Get High
When I'm Feeling Low
Sometimes I Can Rise
When It's In My Soul
I Said Join Me For A Ride
And I'll Take You On The Road
But The Path That I'm On
Man Who Knows Where I'll Go
I Said I'm An MC
And Welcome To My Show
You Can Take Me How I Am
Or Leave My Ass Alone
See I Don't Live My Life For You (Naw)
I Live This Life For Me
And I'm A Give It To You Raw
Just Call Me O.D.B
And I'm Your Ladies Obsession
Like She Got OCD
I'm On A Long Journey
Riding Solo Like A G
And I Try So Many Faults
That I Can't Be Wrong
And If You Feeling Like I'm Feeling
Than This Is Yo Song
You Gotta Stay Strong
Just Hold On
The Finish Line Is Close
And It Won't Be Long
Until It's Victory (Yes)
And We Celebrate (Yes)
I Said It Won't Be Long And I Can't Wait

[Chorus]
