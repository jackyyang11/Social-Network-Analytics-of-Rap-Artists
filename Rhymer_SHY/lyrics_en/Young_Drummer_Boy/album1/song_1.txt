[The Dells]
Matter What The Problems
No Matter Ma-Mat-Mat-Mat-Mat-Mat
Matter What The Problems
Ma-Matter What The Problems

[Verse 1]
A Yo Tell Me What The Problem Is?
Turn In To A Positive
I Ain't Got No Time To Waste
On Muthafuckas That's Negative
Big Bodys In The Streets
Man You Know I Gotta Eat
Flexin', Fuck You
To All Of My Enemies
I'm Smokin' Trees
I Can't Breath
This Paper's In My Mind
I'm Talkin' Constantly
I'm On The Grind
Boy I'm Talkin' All The Time
I Ain't Got No Time To Waste
Man I'm Hittin' Overtime
You Ain't Got No Work Ethic
Tell Me Where Your Package Is?
Me I Send Em Through The Mail
Old Fashion Shit
You Standin' Still
You Ain't Really Makin' Moves
Tell Me How Do You Expect
To Stack Up On Your Revenues
I Ain't Talkin' Beef
I'm Tryin' Show You How To Eat
If You Stick With Me
You Never Seein' Any Problems G
Yeah Problems Be
Only In Your Mind
Just Let Me Recollect
And Give It To You One Time

[Chorus]
Big Bodys In The Streets
In The Streets
You Makin Money
Show Me Where Your Money Be
See Problems Be
Only In Your Mind
Let Me Recollect
And Give It To You One Time
(x2)

[Verse 2]
Yeah Youngstas Like Me
Give A Fuck About This Industry
Do It All - On Our Own
While We Smokin' On Some Weed
Cause We Young
And We Always Keep That Attitude
Fuck Them Old Muthafuckas
Tryin' To Tell Us What To Do
Movin' Product Out The Trunk
That’s Just How We Gotta Do
Do This For Our People
We Don't Do This For Them Other Fools
We Keep It Real
That's The Number 1 Rule
If You Fail On Doing That
Then Your Whole Body Screwed
Young Beef Pullers
If You Got It Stick To It
Only Dreams Comin' Over Night
Nothin' Real To It
You Makin' Music
Stick Up On Your Fucken Grind
You Movin' Weight
Sell About A 100 Dimes
Then A 100 More
Show Me What You Grindin' For
If Its For Your Fam
For Your Homies Sittin' On The Porch
This Game Is Real
And You Never Ignore It
I Gotta Get It
So I'm Always Goin' For It

[Chorus] (x2)

Matter What The Problems
No Matter Ma-Mat-Mat-Mat-Mat-Mat

No Matter What The Problems
No Matter What The Problems
No Matter Ma-Mat-Mat-Mat-Mat-Mat
Matter What The Problems
No Matter What The Problems
