[Blow Movie Scene]

[Hook: Young Drummer Boy]
Everybody Wanna Be A Coke Dealer
Wanna Be A Coke Dealer
Everybody Really Wanna Be The Realest
Tell Me Do You Really Fuckin' Feel It?
Everybody Wanna Be A Coke Dealer
Wanna Be A Coke Dealer
Everybody Really Wanna Be The Realest

[Verse 1: Krypto]
See I Really Wanna Stop Movin' Weight
But Wait, Feeling Kinda Anxious
Driving Out Of State
Hit The 40 East Bound
I Ain't Talkin' Music
Rest In Peace Lupillo
Always Used To Do It
I Was Just Influenced By The Homie Hefty
Rolling Like He Didn't Have A Penny
Knowing Damn Well
He Could've Bought Us All A Bentley
Thats The Real Code, Don't Forget It
I'm Just Chilin' Posted Up With Pretty Women
Let The Swisher Blunt Blow
Got The Homies Buying All Types Of Bottles
In The V.I.P. For The Low
Drug Money Baller Shit
Got Alot Of Work, Just Pay The Bills
Give A Fuck About How You Feel
I Can Only Tell You Whats Real
Movin The Work & I'm Makin The Money
I'm Flipping It, Stackin It
Up, Up, Way High
Making Decisions, I Get It Regardless
I'm Doing It Homie, I'm.. Just High
Voila, I Let The Eagle Fly
Hidden Spots On The Map
Shout Out The Lil Homie Chapo
Big Sapo And Adapt

Everybody Wanna Be A Coke Dealer
Wanna Be A Coke Dealer
Everybody Really Wanna Be The Realest
Tell Me Do You Really Fuckin' Feel It?
Everybody Wanna Be A Coke Dealer
Wanna Be A Coke Dealer
Everybody Really Wanna Be The Realest

[Verse 2: Young Drummer Boy]
Listen, I Been Chillin' With My Fucken Homies
Drinkin', Smokin' With My Fucken Homies
Yeah I Seen A Lot Of Fucken Phonies
Always Acting Like They Really Know Me
Just A Few, Just To Be Specific
That's Just Me Being Optimistic
This Is Only Gon' Take A Minute
Just To Tell You How I'm Really Fucken Feeling
They Say They All Got The Most Bitches
Got The Most Riches & They Hate Snitches
Having Ties With The Cartels
And They Talk About Their Major Drug Sales
Now I Ain't Sayin' That They Fucken Phonie
But Why You Tellin' Me Your Bizness Homie?
See We Got Bitches & We Got Riches
But We Don't Need Another Witness Homie
I See You Riding In Your New Benz
Hanging Out With All Your New Friends
Tell Me Where Your Old Ones At?
Why They Ain't There? Can You Answer That?
I'm Just Being Real Homie
If You Gettin' Money, Then You Doin' Somethin'
If You Sellin' Drugs Or You Takin' Drugs
With Your Ski-Mask On, Gettin' Some
Tell Em All About The Thug Life
You Schemin' & You Plottin All Night
Just For You To Live The Good Life
You Put It All On The Fucken Line
Tell Em That The Life Is Really Real
Tell Em That You Really Makin' Deals
You Really Countin' Figures
And You Pullin Triggers
Just To Live Like A Drug Dealer
