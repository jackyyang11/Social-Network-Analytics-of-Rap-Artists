[Verse 1: Young Drummer Boy]
You do not want me to press the issue
You already know I ain't fucking with you
If you were dead I would never miss you
And I hope that your homies are buried with you
You do not want to be enemies

Shootouts in my front yard

[Verse 2: GT Garza]
Now who is this?
Ain't you know?
What the fuck is [?]
Said you runnin' with the mob
But you ain't never with the game
I ain't never met your people
Rest in peace my grandpa Chico
They tried to hit us with the rico
Cuz they know that I'll [?]
Look [?]
Cuz they heard that it was snowing
Tried to peep out where I'm goin'
I ain't really good with faces
I don't trust them, I don't know them
Hundreds on me so my plan straight
Candy drippin' on my landscape
You ain't rockin' with the fame homie
Dawg please don't at me for a handshake
Look, disappearing in a glass house
In my city I'm a [?]
Stack paper till I build a cash house
Staying counted up until I pass out
From the hood out to a big screen
Same dreams when I was sixteen
Well connected on the west side
And I'm only riding if the whip clean
