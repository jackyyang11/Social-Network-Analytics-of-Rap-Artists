Goddamn Homie
This Weed Got Me Too High Right Now Man

[Verse 1]
Yeah I Be Chilling In The Hood
I Been Smoking On That Fire
I Been Fucking Different Women
Every One That I Desire
I Been Trying To Live That Good Life
Haters Trying To Get Me
I'ma Spot Em With The Red Light
My Homie Tricky Told Me

He Be Posted In The Hood
Smoking Chevys
Listen I Ain't Got No Time
To Be Wasting No Time
I Got Money On My Muthafucken Mind
I Be Rollin' With The Heat
Steady Duckin' From The Heat
While I'm Tryin' To Make
Some Money Off These Beats
Boy I Do It In My Sleep
Name A Boy Who Does It Like This

All Gold On The Wrist
Yeah, Fo-Five On The Hip
And When I Shoot That Muthafucka
It Will Never Miss
I Swear To God

Anybody In My Way
