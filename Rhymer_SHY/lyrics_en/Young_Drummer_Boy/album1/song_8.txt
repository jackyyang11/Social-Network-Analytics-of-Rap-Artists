[Verse 1]
This Situation Is Getting Critical
Keep Your Lame Trash Talkin' To A Minimal
I Used To Wish I Get Signed To A Major Deal
I Used To Hope & Pray
Before Every Meal
Now I Signed To The Realest
Making Dope Beats
So The World's Gotta Feel It
And I Ain't Talkin' Bout Your Boogee Raps
You Could Keep Your Fake Lyrics
I Don't Want That
Everything That I'm Talkin' About Is Fucken Real
My Lil Cousin Really Gotta Spend His Life In Jail
Oh You Think Its Cool?
You Think Its Gee Right?
Well Ask Him
He Could Tell You What It Be Like
Always Waitin' For Your Family On Visitation
Its Been About 3 Months & He's Still Waitin'
And Your Old Homies
They Don't Really Know You
They Always Say They Got Love
But They Never Show You
So I'm Focused On Doing Me
I Lost A Few Friends
Had A Couple Casualties
Now I Gotta Work Hard For My Family
I Don't Expect For Yall To Understand Me

[Hook]
Fuck All Of You Fake Rappers
Cuz To Me Yall Just Some Fuckin' Actors
Spit The Truth When You Talk
You Ain't Really Real
When The Truth Comes Out
Then They'll Know The Deal

[Verse 2]
You Say You Tryin' To Take Your Family
Out The Hood Right?
But Everytime You Rap
You Talk About The Hood Life
But That's Just Me
Cause I Remain Loyal
I'm A Slave To My Fam & My Own Soil
In A Ride Hop Out
Gun Shots Rang out
This Is What It's All About
I'm Just Tryin' To Make It Out
Focused On My Money Now
I Don't Care What You Phonies Wanna Talk About
I Can't Hear You
Cause The Weed I Smoke Is Too Loud
I Got A Son Now
He Looks Up To Me
And I Promise That I'm A Give Him Everything
Hey To All You Fake Rappers
You Ain't Really Real
It Only Took One Bar
To Tell You How I Feel
See The Game Will Go On
Without You Or Me
So Right Now
I'm More Focused Than I'll Ever Be

[Hook]
