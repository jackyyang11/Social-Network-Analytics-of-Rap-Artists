Fly Away
Fly Away

Verse 1:
Yeah, I'm Gon' Fly To The Ceilin'
My Homies On Our Block
And They Trying To Make A Killin
You Ain't Feelin
This Life That I'm Livin
I Been Away Homie
Now I'm Back With A Vengeance
Not To Mention The Style We On
We Bangin On Them Drums
Like King Kong
I Smoke Weed
Just To Feel Right
I Fuck With A Bad Bitch
To Fill My Apatite
If The Feeling Right
Then I'm On One
I Pray Muthafuckas
Really Tryin' To Get Some
What's The Next One?
See I'm Off That
I'm In My Ride
And I'm Wonderin'
Where To Park It At
I'm An Honest Cat
Why You Talkin' Back?
Don't Make Me Chase Your Ass Around
Like A Lil Rat
Stop That Man
You Ain't Really That Tough
I Rather Chill
And Just Smoke
On Some Sticky Stuff

[Chorus]
We Gon' Fly To The Ceilin'
Put This In Your Ride
And I Know You Gon' Feel It
(x4)

Verse 2:
Smoke One
Now I'm On To The Next One
I Ain't Got No Time To Waste
I'm On A Good One
Yeah I'm A Make You Feel This
Sit Back & Chill
With a Bad Bitch
Yeah
You Ain't Doin Any Damage
So You Gotta Flip The Script
Like A Savage
Imagine
You The Ruler Of All Time
Say Fuck Anybody
That Be Tryin' To Take Mine
Two 9's In Your Back
Like Rambo
They Ain't Knowin'
That You're Too Hot To Handle
It's Mando
Gotta Stack Up On Your Bank Roll
And Dip Around & Show Em
What's In Your Bank Though
See I'm All About
My Cake Though
Don't Talk About
What You Muthafuckas Don't know
Diamonds
Gon' Shine Through My Pores
I'm Going In The Dark
So You Know I'm Off-Course
I'm Trying To Shine Like The Doors
I Wanna Fly Like A Bird When It Soars
Like A Bird When It Soars
I Wanna Fly Like A Bird When It Soars

[Chorus] (x4)

Fly Away, With You
Fly Away, Fly-Fly - Away
