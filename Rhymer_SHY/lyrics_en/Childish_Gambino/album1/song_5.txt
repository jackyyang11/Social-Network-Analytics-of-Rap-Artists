[Preacher: Childish Gambino]
As we stand together
Promise me
That we'll teach the children
That we must be free
There is no joy in sorrow
No truth untold
And the cruel above us
Are tired and old

Mother infinity
Why do you go, away from me?

Do you see me?

A voice keeps on telling me
That we've got to be
That we have to be
Free

[Verse: Childish Gambino]
Super computer status
Walking alone in the street
Everyone is an addict
Know what its gonna be
[?] the motivation
Constant communication
Everyone wanna get chose like Moses
Came up from the earth smelling like roses
Talkin' the new edition, [?] too efficient
Man that's a guinea pig, I did it with no permission
I told him to call a friend
Told him they didn't listen
To very scary, to binary
Zero or one? That code is like, [?]
Not black and white
[?]
Who doesn't understand? [?]You were supposed to survive
You know we gon' die
[?]

[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
Everybody move your body, now do it
Here is something that's gonna make you move and groove
(Please don't lose that tempo) Algorythm
([?] how hard they say so) Algorythm

[Verse: Childish Gambino]
If you feelin' this shit, I wanna hear you say "Hell yeah"
If you feelin' this shit, wanna hear you say "Hell yeah"

[Verse: Toronto performance]
We still ballin' we still movin'
We got a million and a half and we still [?]
Everybody sayin' that we don't got enough
[When] we talk about all of that crazy stuff

The internet, the media, the information, we killin' 'em
One-by-one, two-by-two, get dragged by [?]
Nobody can tell you what to do
Nobody can tell you what to say
And everybody knows that we're only going one way
And we gon say

[Verse: Atlanta Performance]
Everybody wanna feel the same way
But everybody wanna do the same thing
And if you talkin' that real bullshit, then you might as well buy that golden ring

Too many lovers
Too many colors
Too many different
Too many sinners
I got to get it
But everybody tryna listen to the same one
And everybody buys the same gun
And everybody gonna make you feel like you don't need to act like
You don't have, but you do
And this the real shit that we gon' do with this

[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
Everybody move your body, now do it
Here is something that's gonna make you move and groove
(Please don't lose that tempo) Algorythm
([?] how hard they say so) Algorythm

[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
Everybody move your body, now do it
Here is something that's gonna make you move and groove
Algorythm, Algorythm
