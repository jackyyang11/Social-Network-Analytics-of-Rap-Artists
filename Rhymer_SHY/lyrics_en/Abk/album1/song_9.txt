They call me ghetto neighbor, I don't give a fuck
Sounds bumping all night steadily waking you up
Homies banging on the door because I'm slanging the tree
24 hour weed spot, buy 2 get one free
Every week another piece of property getting stolen
Checking in you little buster watch your eye get swollen
Neighborhood badass, I think the whole block hates me
???? psycho motherfucker acting crazy
Ever since the young age of 13
Same house, different neighbors, and they all blame me
For all them cars that got stolen
The windows that got broken
A handful of jewelry that the cops caught me holding
I never been caught for a crime that I commited
I never seen a fat ass lick and didn't hit it
All the murders that they claiming I ain't stressing that shit
Cause if you got the evidence then come convict me bitch

(Chorus)
Would you be my
Could you be my
Won't you be my
Ghetto neighbor
Would you be my
Could you be my
Won't you be my
We neighbors ya'll
Would you be my
Could you be my
Won't you be my
I brings the drama
Would you be my
Could you be my
Won't you be my
Ghetto neighbor

(Monoxide Child)
Cars and stray dogs always fucking up my grass
And everytime you see me coming you know I'm about to ask
Where your 5 at? I'm buying weed in 10 sacks
And fucking bitch at Burger King just to get some free snacks
Standing on my porch in a robe
I got some top tens with no shoe strings, I'm out cold
In the cold, hoping ain't nothing
My eye catch and running pockets like a campaign rep is getting snatched
Dice game on the side of the crib
I'm shooting dollar in this motherfucker, who else in?
And the cops got a problem with me, who knows why?
Probably cause I got a couple tagged cars in my diveway
I keep it ghetto like the whitest of trash
Selling food stamps for cash just to get up on the phat pad
So when you see me on your block watch your back
Cause Monoxide will lay a mothafucka out flat

(Chorus)
Would you be my
Could you be my
Won't you be my
Ghetto neighbor
Would you be my
Could you be my
Won't you be my
We neighbors ya'll
Would you be my
Could you be my
Won't you be my
I brings the drama
Would you be my
Could you be my
Won't you be my
Ghetto neighbor

(Paris)
Who's that nigga slash Nasdaq sponsored ass?
Soldier devils never love, fucking up your country club
Bailing through the gates, raising hatred in they eyes
Why try to calculate when niggas make it when I ride by
Though you can't stand seeing any non-European
Having things, what a shame niggas come, then you fleeing
But we won't ? to take advantage, better school
Bigger plots, acre lots, pushing Benz and selling stocks
Guess who coming to dinner in your area?
Know you hate to share it I love it when I'm scaring the
Bitches in my neighborhood, I'm brutal on your whole committee
Never seemed to see how niggas coming from the city pretty
But we rolling, folding the cash holding
Bitch, I'm showing out, keep my bidness out yo mouth
Climbing all them racist holes
Juggalos know a devil should
Roughest on my cul de sac
There go the neighborhood

(Chorus x2)
Would you be my
Could you be my
Won't you be my
Ghetto neighbor
Would you be my
Could you be my
Won't you be my
We neighbors ya'll
Would you be my
Could you be my
Won't you be my
I brings the drama
Would you be my
Could you be my
Won't you be my
Ghetto neighbor
