(Gangsta!)

Now if you got your hat tilted to the side
And you're always down to jack a bitch for her ride
Or the colors that your rep, make others upset
Then you might be.... GANG RELATED (Ain't nothing wrong)

Never once been seen alone
Ever since you can remember you was fully grown
Slanging rocks on the block
With a knot in your sock
Then you might be.... GANG RELATED (Ain't nothing wrong)

Murder rap, notches all on your belt
Robbery and selling trees the only jobs that you held
Been to more damn funerals than the reverend himself
Then you might be.... GANG RELATED (Ain't nothing wrong)

In and out the penitenary
With no thought of graduation or a fucking degree
Still clocking cheese from what you learned on the streets
Then you might be.... GANG RELATED (Ain't nothing wrong)

(Chorus)
You might be, you might be, GANG RELATED (Ain't nothing wrong)
You might be, you might be, GANG RELATED (Ain't nothing wrong)

Do you wear a hatchetman?
Then you in a gang, and your ass better be ready to do that thang
You rep the JRB and you will never switch
(JRB?) JUGGALO RYDAS BITCH!
Do you beat your girlfriends who diss your boys?
Did your crews name originate in Illinois?
Did you cross your enemies out with a K?
Then you gang related too muthafucka,like Violent J

I'm always asked if I'm gang related
By police and the public and I'm starting to hate it
If I wasn't already, that would sure make me think
About the prolems that I have and what I do to be free
Besides, gang related's such a harsh word
For now I'll call a bunch of homies taking over the world
Willing to die for everything that we built
The battleground we call turf where haters come to be killed

(Chorus)
When you participate in gang related activities
03's, 211's, 187's, If you do, that's ok, fuck we all do
I'm only tryn' to say you gang related too, bitch
Take Any Body Killer, I know him
But I wouldn't trust him as far as I can throw him
He's fucking crazy as hell, you wouldn't know
Right now he's chewing holes in the floor here at the studio
I don't even wanna do this
But he asked me to and I'm scared of his pistol whips
We're all sick in the hatchet's hatchery
But I just happen to be the master of bitch-slappery
The bottom line is, I won't say it again
Until you play it again, if your gang related
Hope you're my friend, cause I see you wearing some shit I don't like
I'm shutting your cranium down with a lead pipe!

(Chorus)
Hahahahahaha, you know what man, you just MIGHT be
In spite of your own knowledge of it, a gangster, gang-o-bodicious maximus-maximum boogie-woogie ryda, a.k.a gang related, YOU DELAPIDATED MUTHAFACKOOO!

You might be, gang related (Ain't nothing wrong)
You might be, gang related (Ain't nothing wrong)
You might be, gang related (Ain't nothing wrong)
You might be, gang related (Ain't nothing wrong)

YOU MIGHT BE! YOU MIGHT BE, GANG RELATED
YOU MIGHT BE! YOU MIGHT BE, GANG RELATED
YOU MIGHT BE! YOU MIGHT BE, GANG RELATED
YOU MIGHT BE! YOU MIGHT BE, GANG RELATED
YOU MIG
HT BE! YOU MIGHT BE, GANG RELATED
YOU MIGHT BE! YOU MIGHT BE, GANG RELATED
YOU MIGHT BE! YOU MIGHT BE, GANG RELATED
YOU MIGHT BE! YOU MIGHT BE, GANG RELATED
