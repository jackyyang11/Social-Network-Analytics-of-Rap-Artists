ABK:
Where you at mother f**ker?
Heard you been talking shit
But everytime I come around its like you seen to forget
Shut your mouth you little hoe before I scalp your lip
In other words you'd be a dead little punk ass bitch
I won't forget you everytime I'm pissing over your grave
Or when I'm slanging peyote in hoods that you once claimed
Learn about the tribe you're dissing cause we all ain't the same
Tomahawk steady swinging as I'm dancing for rain
So come and , play with me
At least until the sky turns gray
Shooting off my arrows like AK's 
Amazing situations four colors of man
Represent the wicked nation
Underground street level
Running it's course
Keeping you shady bitches scared to come up off your porch so come and
Hang with me
Unless you blaming me
Because the native hydro keeps changing me

Come and play with me!
(Even if it means your death)
Come and play, You hated me!
(My tomahawk swings right to left)
You bitches wait and see!
(I'll be a juggalo till' my very last breathe)
And you hate to see!
(These hatchet men upon out chests)
Come and play with me..

Warriors come out and play
Roaches are straight
I'm A-B-K!
I'd rather be dead then fade away
All my life I've been a scrub I wouldn't change a day
What I'm saying quit playing
I'mma tell you how its laying
See me in the streets
Psychopathic Chain Just Swaying
ABK so it ain't no delaying
Dead bodies 6 feet in the ground decaying
When I come out with the serial numbers on my gun out
The tribal war paint on my face will make you run out
Bust shots in the sky and shoot the sun out
And keep busting the clip until every last one out
Erasing all the drama that this world brings
Moon light shines bright on shattered dreams
Keep away from a killa
With a gat that freinds
And get your own f**king bullshit schemes

Come and play with me!
(Even if it means your death)
Come and play, You hated me!
(My tomahawk swings right to left)
You bitches wait and see!
(I'll be a juggalo till' my very last breathe)
And you hate to see!
(These hatchet men upon out chests)
Come and play with me..

Jamie Madrox:
Twiztid, Madrox, And The A-B-K
Buying automatic weapons from renegade and Bombay
F**k alize and them fake ass pimps
We the sharks in the water
Ya'll popcorn shrimps
So you can eat my cocktail sauce and ass
Throw an east in the air, when we walk past
Think fast
You can be a hater with a lot to say
But you talking from the door so come out and play..

Come and play with me!
(Even if it means your death)
Come and play, You hated me!
(My butcher knife swings right to left)
You bitches wait and see!
(I'll be a juggalo till' my very last breathe)
And you hate to see!
(These hatchet men upon out chests)
Come and play with me..

Come and play with me!
(Even if it means your death)
Come and play, You hated me!
(My tomahawk swings right to left)
You bitches wait and see!
(I'll be a juggalo till' my very last breathe)
And you hate to see!
(These hatchet men upon out chests)
Come and play with me..

These hatchet men up on our chest...
These hatchet men up on our chest...
These hatchet men up on our chest...
These hatchet men up on our chest...
