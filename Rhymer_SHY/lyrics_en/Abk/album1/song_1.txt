(Repeat x2)
Do I really wanna see so clear
Even though I know bad things might appear
Tell me that it's not a waste of time
To ride around and stare up here to try and clear my mind

I was asked this question, not too far back
"Did you ever think that you would be where you at?"
Small child, state of mind, knew I would
Plus the sound of the drum from the wind felt good
Place and time, though, age showed me
Gave a scrub mad love, now we all family
No backs, never, I won't turn
Don't act like my soul ain't concerned
About, if you like me, if you hate me
When I die, will they take me someone tell me
If I see you all another day
Like I never would be flippin' the script
With these livewire lips that ignite with spit

(Chorus)
I'm writing this as if it was my last
Thank you for the memories and times we had
(2 Whom This May Concern)
2 Whom This May Concern
(2 Whom This May Concern)
Remember me as if I never went away
Because I see you all another day
(2 Whom This May Concern)
2 Whom This May Concern
(2 Whom This May Concern)

What I'm ah..bout to say, some might hate
Some might feel, that I'm keepin' it real
If I...drop the steel, and grab the axe
Cut down trees just to clear a path
Try to show ya'll wrong from right
A down state of mind means too uptight
Think positive, better opportunities
Red, yellow, black, and white, muhf**kin' unity
You ain't foolin' me, Ain't nobody schoolin' me
Graduated from the streets of Ghetto University
Most people can't deal with this
So quick to grab a pistol cause they too damn pissed

(Chorus)
I'm writing this as if it was my last
Thank you for the memories and times we had
(2 Whom This May Concern)
2 Whom This May Concern
(2 Whom This May Concern)
Remember me as if I never went away
Because I see you all another day
(2 Whom This May Concern)
2 Whom This May Concern
(2 Whom This May Concern)

Dirty History, it's all the same
Ain' no livin' soul gonna take the blame
For all the suicidal things I did
All the pain that was caused to acheive a wish
Suffering, body recovering
Struggling, when things start bubbling
Can't wash away what's not seen
Guess we all gotta little dirty history
Eeeny meeny miney moe
Made this killa mad now we outta control
Don't know which way to go
Time to pick up the pace and let the whole world know

(Chorus 2X)
I'm writing this as if it was my last
Thank you for the memories and times we had
(2 Whom This May Concern)
2 Whom This May Concern
(2 Whom This May Concern)
Remember me as if I never went away
Because I see you all another day
(2 Whom This May Concern)
2 Whom This May Concern
(2 Whom This May Concern)
