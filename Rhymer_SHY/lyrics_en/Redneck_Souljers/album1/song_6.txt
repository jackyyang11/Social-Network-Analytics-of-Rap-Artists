[Pre-Chorus]
Walk up in he club like what up I'm in my overalls
Hick boots on, man I'm sweatin' can't see non of ya'll!
Got a new hair do, and my trooper shades too
When redneck in the club
There ain't no tellin' what we'll do

[Chorus]
What we'll do! what we'll do!
Cause we don't know just what to do
See we just came up out the woods
We ain't familiar with these roots
What we'll do, what we'll do
See we don't know know just what to do
See we just came up out the woods
A couple roosters flew the coop

[Verse 1]
Boy, hot damn, shit fire, save the matches
Throw these rednecks in the club
There ain't no tellin' what could happen
I am gone with the wind
Jim Beam runnin' through my system
Made a couple new friends
Said they brought the homegrown with em'
Me and big John ate some mushrooms
I can't feel my dern heart
My head spinnin' so damn fast I think I'm Dale Earnheart
Hope I dont crash, (gasp) gas
I think I just seen his ghost
Raise that beer can in my hand
Then I give the man a toast
See that's shit that isn't fair
Hell I guess I'm toastin' air
While wonder boys buyin' ladies drinks
Like he don't even care
Lil Wyte's off in the corner eatin' molly's by the gram
Fat Tarr's in the parkin' lot actin' like Yosemite Sam
Goin ham, oink, oink, hope nobody calls the cops
I think this honey wants to boink
If my girl finds out we both get shot
Better hop outta here
I think we mighta over done, too much fun
Better hit the waffle house and sober up

[Pre-Chorus]
Walk up in he club like what up I'm in my overalls
Hick boots on, man I'm sweatin' can't see non of ya'll!
Got a new hair do, and my trooper shades too
When redneck in the club
There ain't no tellin' what we'll do

[Chorus]
What we'll do! what we'll do!
Cause we don't know just what to do
See we just came up out the woods
We ain't familiar with these roots
What we'll do, what we'll do
See we don't know know just what to do
See we just came up out the woods
A couple roosters flew the coop

[Verse 2]
What the shit, went to piss
Ran into a glory hole, what kinda club is this?
Just got here, now I wanna go
Good thing I got real drunk
Fore' we even left the house
Took a drink of moonshine
I had that fire in my mouth! (WOO!
Here I come... there I go...)
Watch me blow a big cloud of stinky diesel smoke!
(Here I come...there I go...)
Watch me blow a big cloud of stinky diesel smoke!
I been up in here bout a minute, think I feel real drunk
Imma get five shots of jack then I'm gon' see just what is up
Imma get three Jager-bombs and all at once I'll turn em' up
No I will not leave a tip, cause I just spent my last buck
But I will go, get a dip, I will pack it in my lip
And on the way out the door, on that floor
I might just spit, got the tiller gang ridin' with me
And I drunk as cootie brown
Ain't been good with them gloves
But I been great with that Crown...
(Crown,Crown...Crown, Crown...Great with that Crown.)

[Chorus]
What we'll do! what we'll do!
Cause we don't know just what to do
See we just came up out the woods
We ain't familiar with these roots
What we'll do, what we'll do
See we don't know know just what to do
See we just came up out the woods
A couple roosters flew the coop


What we'll do! what we'll do!
Cause we don't know just what to do
See we just came up out the woods
We ain't familiar with these roots
What we'll do, what we'll do
See we don't know know just what to do
See we just came up out the woods
A couple roosters flew the coop
