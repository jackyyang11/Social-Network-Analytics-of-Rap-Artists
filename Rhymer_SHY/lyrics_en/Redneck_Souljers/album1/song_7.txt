[Intro]
Empire

[Chorus]
Got the big subs knockin'
And the whiskey bottles poppin' (Gettin' up)
And I'm ridin' with my folks
Can't give a fuck about the law
Or the haters or tomorrow (Gettin' up)
And I'm wild and with my boys (Gettin' up)
I said I'm wild and with my boys (Gettin' up)
I said I'm wild and with my boys (Gettin' up)
Got the windows down, fuck it now, smilin' at my boys (Gettin' up)
And I'm wild and with my boys (Gettin' up)

[Verse 1: Fatt Tarr]
Black 1500, 120 on the interstate
Subs underneath the seat the size of a dinner plate
2500 watts, flip face, pushin' bass
Girl on my line, it get rotated like spinner bait
You can't hold a plane, nah dog let me demonstrate
Trout, carp and bass ain't the only thing that's in our lake
Better act fast or your ass will be grass
Gettin' mowed over by a bulldozer, hit the gas
I'm lightin' up the trees like the ghost of Christmas past
It's a Fatt Tarr, Mr. Alabaster Black
And I'm back like Dracula, flask in my hand
With some Tennessee legends, you a flash in the pan
All my hittas kamikazes like we crashed in Japan
We the Tiller Gang dangit, tippin' bottles, crackin' cans
Ain't a chance that you'll pass, just leave us the hell alone
Shotgun to the dome, ain't talkin' 'bout blowin' dro

[Chorus]
Got the big subs knockin'
And the whiskey bottles poppin' (Gettin' up)
And I'm ridin' with my folks
Can't give a fuck about the law
Or the haters or tomorrow (Gettin' up)
And I'm wild and with my boys (Gettin' up)
I said I'm wild and with my boys (Gettin' up)
I said I'm wild and with my boys (Gettin' up)
Got the windows down, fuck it now, smilin' at my boys (Gettin' up)
And I'm wild and with my boys (Gettin' up)

[Verse 2: C-Hubb]
Well I've been on this hash all damn day (Damn)
I'm 'bout to spiral out like a staircase (Damn)
My boys all wonderin' why they starin' (Damn)
It's probably 'cause our eyes lookin' buried
And we some super-villains feelin' like the baddest
And me and Pryor Beats are beatin' savage
We all blowin' cabbage
That homegrown make you phone home, it ain't average
Tell them hatin' boys to kiss our asses
'Cause they know Souljer's flow
Gon' be lil' colder than we just hit it
My boys go loco, ain't no bitches wit' me (Bitches wit' me)
Drinkin' on them back roads, ain't no shitty city (Shitty City)
If you think I'm kiddin' then when you get wit' me
See that my house bound full of crazy maniacs
I've known them all since way back
All of us whippin' Dodge and Chevy
Never seen a damn Maybach
We was gone a minute then we came back
Now you can't avoid us like a state tax
Non-believers need to pray fast
'Bout to hit their asses in a face mask

[Chorus]
Got the big subs knockin'
And the whiskey bottles poppin' (Gettin' up)
And I'm ridin' with my folks
Can't give a fuck about the law
Or the haters or tomorrow (Gettin' up)
And I'm wild and with my boys (Gettin' up)
I said I'm wild and with my boys (Gettin' up)
I said I'm wild and with my boys (Gettin' up)
Got the windows down, fuck it now, smilin' at my boys (Gettin' up)
And I'm wild and with my boys (Gettin' up)

[Verse 3: Outlaw]
F-F-Fatt Tarr came up to me, said he wanted a beer (Beer)
I didn't even hear him 'cause my mind was on a buck (Buck)
Realest in the game, I don't even give a shit (Shit)
Gonna blow it big like Dolly Parton's cheek bones (What?)
Hope up the club with some whiskey
All these girls around us gettin' really, really drunk (Drunk)
One of them spiked my drink and put me in a fright (Ah)
But now I'm good as gold and wow this beat is really wild
B-B-B-Back again with the Souljers
Got a 300 pound chick up on my fuckin' shoulders
It hurts that she hit me with her purse, pow
Made my headache worse, ow
Think I need the nurse to get me high like Captain Kirk, wow
Everybody get in my truck
Pedal to the medal 'til we get real stuck
I don't give a fuck about whatchu gonna do about it?
And I ain't afraid to shoot
Take my boot, take your ass
Stick it hard like a Tennessee bass
Outlaw with the Redneck Souljers 'bout to leap like Sassafras

[Chorus]
Got the big subs knockin'
And the whiskey bottles poppin' (Gettin' up)
And I'm ridin' with my folks
Can't give a fuck about the law
Or the haters or tomorrow (Gettin' up)
And I'm wild and with my boys (Gettin' up)
I said I'm wild and with my boys (Gettin' up)
I said I'm wild and with my boys (Gettin' up)
Got the windows down, fuck it now, smilin' at my boys (Gettin' up)
And I'm wild and with my boys

Got the big subs knockin'
And the whiskey bottles poppin' (Gettin' up)
And I'm ridin' with my folks
Can't give a fuck about the law
Or the haters or tomorrow (Gettin' up)
And I'm wild and with my boys (Gettin' up)
I said I'm wild and with my boys (Gettin' up)
I said I'm wild and with my boys (Gettin' up)
Got the windows down, fuck it now, smilin' at my boys (Gettin' up)
And I'm wild and with my boys
