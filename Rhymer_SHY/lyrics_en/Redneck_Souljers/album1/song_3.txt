Dear lord I've got to see some change 'cause the man in the mirrors got a mask on his face
Father forgive me for my sinful ways I'm just tired of being treated like a damned ol' stray
But every dog has his days
And I'ma make it mine

Man I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired but I'ma give this shit one last try
Riding into town and my eyes are wide
[?] and my mouth is dry
Desperate times call for desperate measures
Desperado seeking treasure
But I ain't found this buried in the ground
I looked around and I feel dumb founded
I met up with Hubb right outside of those gates
Cause were pissed off of being pissed on by
Rich boys with silver plates
But we'll stake our claim
Here and now listen up and I'll tell you how
I'ma go first with this sawed off
And if there's anyone left you gonna take 'em out
Here's the plan
Hit the safe gonna break it down
First off we gon' stand Hubb in that thing like he's from outta town
And put the money down
Like he wants a brand new ticket for the lottery
He'll scratch it off then hit the door
And then commitence the robbery
Busted in the door and let's the buck shots sing
[?] with the safe starts feeling like a dream
Watched her hit the wall she probably won't feel a thing
But Hubb looked back at me like "what the he'll did I just see"

Dear lord I've got to see some change cause the man in the mirrors got a mask on his face
Father forgive me for my sinful ways I'm just tired of being treated like a damned ol stray
But every dog has his day
And I'ma make it mine

Rolled up in the town on a black stallion
400 horse on the gas gallon
Tumble weeds
Hit the brakes
Dusty breeze
Dismount, hit the ground with them guns out
And the suns out
Its high noon somebody might loose their life soon
Cause I need a break but can't seem to catch one
Bullets are gonna fly if I don't get some cash soon
I have to, 'cause I'd hate to show y'all a bad dude
But man I'm really getting pissed off
So broke I ain't even got a piss pot
I'ma get mine with the six shot
As the reason were making this little pit stop
Yeah
So I laid my money on the on the counter top it's
So quiet you could hear a penny drop
Then I start to sweat man grab a handkerchief
From my jacket pocket
Cashier says "whatcha need honey?"
Lottery ticket here's my money
When she hands it to me
Next thing I know poor girl laying down bleeding out
In front me ears ringing as the sinners enter
The room in the back with the safe was centered
Look down in dismay cause it was all In vain
The lotto ticket was a winner
Twenty thousand
Plain as day
Now there blood on my hands can't wash away
Ya know what they say
Every dog has his day

Man what's the hold up we've done the hold up
Hit the safe that's where the money's stowed up
Man I know but this tickets loaded
We killed somebody this plan has blown up
No time to waste man fuck the safe let's get somewhere
Where nobody knows us
Jump out the window!
Woah!
Guess who showed up
Hit the ground with the glass shards
5-0 flying in like Nascar
We bit the dust then started running
Half way to the car they started gunning
Blood pouring outta my nose cause they shot our asses we froze up
We looked around dropped to the ground
Next thing ya know we woke up

Dear lord I've gotta see some change cause the man in the mirrors got a mask on his face
Father forgive me for my sinful ways I'm just tired of being treated like a damned ol stray
But every dog has his days
And imma make it mine
