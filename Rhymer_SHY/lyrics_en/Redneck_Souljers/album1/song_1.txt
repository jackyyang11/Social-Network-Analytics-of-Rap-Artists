Rednecks up in this thing you better bounce
Its tittys jigglin
While we pourin liquor by the ounce
Jack daniels on the house
We bout to get stupid
Get up and move it
Just forget what your doin
And make it bounce
Now let me ask you what these
Things have in common (have in common)
Dryer sheets trampolines and your mamma
Think about it for a second
Nevermind Im gonna tell ya
So incase you haven't guessed it its that bounce
Like king shots of them mudballs
Some double D's in my front lawn
Like Redneck Souljers music does with my subs on
Came thru we got mud on
Diesel smoke like it damn money
All the country girls hooked on it
Not fun its that bounce boy
Now make it bounce like a basketball
We ain't talkin sports boy not at all
Chevy trucks got lift kits mud tires got big grips
We bounce around her nip slips
On all 4's on 4 wheels
All night we gonna bounce
I ain't in no rock band
But we rocked that whole croud
Hickcock 2chains
My lines dope as cocaine is
Rockin them shotguns and flannels like Cobain did
Rednecks up in this thing you better bounce
Its tittys jigglin
While we pourin liquor by the ounce
Jack daniels on the house
We bout to get stupid
Get up and move it
Just forget what your doin
And make it bounce
Now make it bounce
Yeah make it bounce
Now make it bounce
Just forget what your doin and make it bounce
Well I walked up in the place
And all I saw was tittys
20 beers from the bar got me feelin shitty
Filled up gallon to my left
Wonderboi to my right
Mikey's got a stack or two and hes gonna spend it all tonight
Yeah stack or two gettin high
While their bouncing left to right
Nashville or Huntsville
I forgot where we're at tonight
Thats alright thats ok
Its just any given day
Money flyin in this mothertrucker
Like a hurricane
Some type'a wayne came on and
Everybody lost there shit
Broke my phone ain't goin home
And I can't get enough of this
Took a piss at 3AM
Right out side the waffle house
Man its time we get our ass
To that hotel and passout
Woke up and sat down I done
Spent half of my money
We was bouncin we was rockin
Wonders's dropped about 600
Man i swear man i swear
I dont wanna leave that place
But I dont care i dont care
I won't forget that waitress' face
Rednecks up in this thing you better bounce
Its tittys jigglin
While we pourin liquor by the ounce
Jack daniels on the house
We bout to get stupid
Get up and move it
Just forget what your doin
And make it bounce
Now make it bounce
Make it bounce
Now make it bounce
Just forget what your doin and make it bounce
