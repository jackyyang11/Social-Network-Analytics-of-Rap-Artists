[Verse 1: C-Hubb]
I build me up a house of cards
Just so I can knock em' down
You lookin’ for them city boys
Won't find them cause they not around
Not in my town, not in my state
Not in south, not any-where
Got four girls on four-wheelers
Took four shots of whiskey! (Yeah)

Chevy trucks we drive um'
Motorcycles we like um'
Ask Bigg John, he's in the front lawn
Them bon-fires we all night um!
We tilt back till we fall down
Stay passed out till we get up
Got 52 girls playin’ 52 pick up
In the sticks with a gallon fulla hiccup

[Chorus]
Country Boes
I hit you with a chair!
Goin’ buck wild on em’
Hell-In-a-Cell
Powerbomb you through the stairs
We some Country Boes
Give em the peoples elbow
We don’t tell no, lies
We just some country boys so you know that we can survive
(x2)

[Verse 2: Fatt Tarr]
Beer cans off in the yard
Liquor bottles and southern cars
Moonshine still in the jar
Let me tell you what we about
We getting down under the stars
Kickin’ pigs asses to Mars
Sittin’ around like fools
Poppin’ bras and playin’ cards
Fatt Tarr, in the pines or at the bar
Goin Jeff Jarrett on um I just broke my damn guitar
C-Hubb went woooooo - Ric Flair, the powers in his hair
Not Pusher T but like Booker T
When I’m flying through the air

[Chorus]
Country Boes
I hit you with a chair!
Goin’ buck wild on em’
Hell-In-a-Cell
Powerbomb you through the stairs
We some Country Boes
Give em the peoples elbow
We don’t tell no, lies
We just some country boys so you know that we can survive
We just some country boys so you know that we can survive
