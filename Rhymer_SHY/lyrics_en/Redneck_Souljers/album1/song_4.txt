[Verse 1: Fatt Tarr]

I think about my life and my mind
And my time, about the same
If I don’t give’em all I got
Then with the rain they’ll change
I know I been paintin’ pictures
It’s richer than all this wicker
After all of that I learned, blood is thicker
Than beer and liquor
If you don’t slow down
Life’ll catch ya like a pitcher
95 mile per hour fastball
You better hit’er
Never quitter,I’m a winner
Get my frickin’ chicken dinner
I’m gon’ kick it ‘til the end
Until my bones n’ shins are splinters
I’m a victor, not a victim
Tell that son of a bitch to come get him some
Homegrown by nature
I don’t give a damn about what you’ve done
Rollin’ stone, this ranger
Been run off the road and in plenty mud
I’mma come back with the dual smoke stacks
12 pack in the back and that’s just because…
I’mma bust ‘til I fall
‘til the dust
My engine gon’ keep a  runnin’
‘til it’s stuck n’ full of rust
My family and C-Hubb
The only ones that I trust
Don't like it, it's not a must
We’re doin’ this shit for us


[hook: C-Hubb]

‘Cause there ain't no way to know if I’m gonna make it
It’s a once in a lifetime chance, and I’m gonna take it
I’ve been travelin’ down this road for so long
Just searchin’ for my soul and the strength to go on
But I’mma keep on keepin’ on
I’mma keep on keepin’ on


[Verse 2: C-Hubb]

First of all, If you’re listening
Then I wanna say Thank You, greatly
‘Cause my mind has been goin’
Each and every direction lately
It’s amazing how crazy
This shit gets, so I been hazy
Workin’ my hardest
Tryin’ to be the South’s Slim Shady
‘cause I been focusin’ on music in my free time
And me n’ Tarr plan to make a livin’ off of these rhymes
But I’m workin’ my ass off at a factory,and I’m mad at me
‘cause I know that I’ve got  talent when it comes to  music that someone has to see
So, gradually I’m practicing
And mastering the skills I use
So next time when I get off in the booth
I got the best rhymes and I still tell the truth
And the truth is
If I don’t make it doin’ music
Then I don’t know what the hell to do
This is my life, that’s why I write the things I’m tellin’ you
I speak my heart and soul
And all our fans got a heart of gold
Ya’ll are the reason that we are here
No matter what ya’ll are told
So, I’m simply gonna end this with a, “Thank You.”
And I’ll be reppin’ Tiller Gang until I can’t move!


[Bridge: C-Hubb/Fatt Tarr]

No, there ain't no way to know…

If I’m gonna make it
But I only got one shot
So boe I gotta take it

No, there ain't no way to know…

It’s a damn long road
But I got a strong soul
I’mma let the story unfold…

And I’m gonna keep on keepin’ on
The pages turnin until their gone
If I make it, I’ll take it, n’ if I do
Then I’m thanking everyone involved
I’m Thanking everyone involved
It takes everyone of ya’ll
Damn it, I believe in my team and my dreams
It’s all I need to succeed, so I;m keepin’ on!

[Hook: C-Hubb]
