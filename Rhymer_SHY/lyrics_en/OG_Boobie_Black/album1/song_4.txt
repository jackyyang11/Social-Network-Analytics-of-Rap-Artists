[Intro:]
Yeah, motherfuckers wanted to know so I had to tell 'em
Y'all always wonderin' why I got my arm under my shirt
Y'all always askin' questions, man
Boobie Black got sum' tucked, you hear me?
I'm from the Magnolia, true story, you heard me?

[First verse:]
The story goes on about my life in the game
My past been a motherfucker, but it ain't no thang
My life is that wrist, but I'm still in the bricks
Committed murders and 90s niggas wanna send hits
Got banged up in the 'Nolia with the K
Stop bussin' back and got that bitch ass nigga out my way
I'm layin' on the drum, I'm bout to die, this shit is real
I'm in a blood pool with my hand on my steel
I'm mad as a motherfucker, blooded like a hoe
My mac 11 still smokin' from them shells that got off
Here comes the ambulance and the fuckin' Five-O's
They askin' many questions but I act like I don't know
I'm on the way to the hospital holdin' on
The paramedics tellin' me I gotta be strong
I wonder will I die, that's what the fuck I'm thinkin'
I know I'm fucked up because I see my arm hangin'
We at our destination, my body's into pain
The nurses and the doctors tryna found out my name
They sendin' me to surgery, they sayin' I'm in critical
I'm layin' on the table with a body full of holes
The doctor got a gasmask pointin' on my face
I'm gettin' kinda sleepy but I'm tryna stay awake
The shit that I'm stressin' is muthafuckin' real
You livin' by the steel, you die by the steel
I hope that I would make it to see another day
Lord knows if I do a lotta niggas gonna pay
I put that on my family, you bitches betta know
But if I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go

[Interlude:]
See that's what it is
When you in that field you see the killer get killed, you heard me
And back in the game, when I was gettin' it in, Niggas was gettin' killed


[Second verse]
This shit is hectic, I'm on the life support
I'm lookin' at my people, my body full of dope
Tubes everywhere, from my nose to my dick
I'm real fucked up with this hospital shit
My muthafuckin' arm, they had to amputate it
They say they couldn't save it cuz the ligaments was shredded
A lotta fuckin' flowers, a lotta fuckin' cards
A lotta fuckin' disses from all kinda broads
I get the fuckin' word, my niggas put in work
Another homicide, a nigga deep in the dirt
A few months later I'm feelin' kinda betta
I'm ready fo' the streets and I'm down fo' whateva
Got a few gats, Mac11 and the Tech
I pack that fuckin' drama, hit it straight to the projects
Lookin' fo' my enemy, young nigga's and his clique
I heard when I got shot up they was all talkin' shit
So niggas disrespectin' cause I'm comin' with that heat
I'm 'bout retaliation put me six feet deep
My gat's gonna blessure, you get the fuckin' picture?
And muthafuckin' right, whoeva loved you gonna miss you
You a dead nigga
