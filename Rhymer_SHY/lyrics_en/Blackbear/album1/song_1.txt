[Chorus]
You thought I wouldn't come around to you, 'round to you
You know I was down for ya, down for you
Now I'm wishing that I never bowed to you, bowed to you
I'm in the shit I can't get out of, I'm not proud of
Hate the sound of all these song 'bout ya, songs 'bout you
You know I was wrong 'bout ya, wrong 'bout you
Let you hold onto this cash, let ya hold onto

[Verse]
I'm in the shit I can't get out of, I ain't proud of
I am running out of time to hold you close
Running out of time to be your man, yeah
I'm just lost in the moment, yeah
I'm just zonin'
I'm running out of time to hold you down
Running out of time to be your man, yeah
I'm just lost in this moment, yeah
I've been zonin'

[Pre-Chorus]
You know that I could get you more, a little more
Whatever you need, what you need
I could get you more, a little more
Whatever you need

[Chorus]
You thought I wouldn't come around to ya, 'round to you
You know I was down for ya, down for you
Now I'm wishing that I never bowed to you, bowed to you
I'm in the shit I can't get out of, I'm not proud of
Hate the sound of all these song 'bout ya, songs 'bout you
You know I was wrong 'bout ya, wrong 'bout you
Let you hold onto this cash, let ya hold onto

[Verse]
I'm in the shit I can't get out of, I ain't proud of
I'm running out of time to hold you close
Running out of time to be your man, yeah
I'm just lost in the moment, yeah
I've been zonin'
I'm running out of time to hold you down
Running out of time to be your man, yeah
I'm just lost in this moment, yeah
I've been zonin'

[Outro]
You know that I could get you more, a little more
Whatever you need, what you need
I could get you more, a little more
Whatever you need
