[Refrain]
Yeah
Laying in her underwear
Tryna see what's under there
I don't wanna ruin it
But you got me excited
I can't fight it with you, oh
Yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Laying in her underwear
I just wanna stop and stare
Wanna see where this could go
But I can see just where this is going
It's too late for slowing down, yeah

[Chorus]
I just wanted you to notice me
I just wanted you to notice me
For who I am
Instead of who I was
Instead of who I'm becoming
That shit ain't love
It ain't love
It ain't love

[Bridge]
Faded jeans and faded room
Didn't wanna fuck it up with you
But she hit me with the, "Come through"
You know, God Damn it, I slide through
Anytime that you need me to, oh

[Refrain]
Yeah
Laying in her underwear
Tryna see what's under there
I don't wanna ruin it
But you got me excited
I can't fight it with you
Yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Laying in her underwear
I just wanna stop and stare
Wanna see where this could go
But I can see just where this is going
It's too late for slowing down, down

[Chorus]
Notice me
I just wanted you to notice me
For who I am
Instead of who I was
Instead of who I'm becoming
That shit ain't love
You know that shit ain't love, yeah
That shit ain't love
Oooh...
