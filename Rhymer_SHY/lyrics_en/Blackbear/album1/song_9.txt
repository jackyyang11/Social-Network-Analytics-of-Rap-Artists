[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh yeah, oh, oh
I burned down my house
Did it all by myself
Threw away all that was once gold to me
Did it all by myself, (Did it all by myself)

[Verse 1]
If ever you want, I would be right by your side
I just wanted to burn it down
Stop is safer than sorry
I just wanted to put it down
Bury it down so deep
‘Cause it’s time to grow up
I know you hate it
But we made it
And at least give me clarity
Just be fair to me

[Verse 2]
I know you’re gonna fuck me up
Fuck me up, one day
I know you’re gonna fuck me up
Fuck me up, one day
Just be fair to me
Swear to me
We won’t end up like your parents were
Back in the day
So in love, it went to waste
We won’t end up like your parents were
Back in the day
You might as well run my feelings over with your car
Put it in reverse and run em back over again
Run my feelings over with your car
Put it in reverse and run em back over again

[Chorus]
I burned down my house
Did it all by myself
Threw away all there was once gold to me
Did it all by myself, oh, oh, ooh, (Did it all by myself)

[Verse 1 Repeated]
If ever you want, I would be right by your side
I just wanted to burn it down
Stop is safer than sorry
I just wanted to put it down
Bury it down so deep
‘Cause it’s time to grow up (baby I've been working so hard)
I know you hate it
But we made it (ooh, oh)
And at least give me clarity
Just be fair to me (do I gotta spell it out)

[Verse 2 Repeated]
I know you’re gonna fuck me up
Fuck me up, one day
I know you’re gonna fuck me up
Fuck me up, one day
Just be fair to me
Swear to me
You might as well run my feelings over with your car
Put it in reverse and run em back over again
Run my feelings over with your car
Put it in reverse and run em back over again

[Hook]
We’re nothing like the ones we were last year
Nothing like the ones we were
Like the ones we were last year
And we laughed and we knew it would be something this serious
