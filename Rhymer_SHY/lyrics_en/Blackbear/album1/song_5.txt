[Verse 1]
I keep on running, keep on running
Keep on running, keep on running
I keep chasing your heart
But I'm always three steps behind

Yeah, I'm all alone
I'm on my own
Without your loving
Without your loving
Baby, I
I chase love and die

[Pre-Chorus]
It's never ending
Never ending
The sea sick feeling
What's the meaning? Oh
I just need a life line

[Chorus]
I'm running away, I'm running away
From this mess we made
I gotta find you, I gotta find you
I gotta find you, I gotta find you
I'm chasing right behind you
I need to remind you
I'm running away, I'm running away
I'm running away, I'm running away
From this mess I made

[Verse 2]
And I keep on running
I keep on running
Can't see nothing
Can't see nothing at all
And everything starts to revolve
I'm coming down
Coming down
Just give me a sign
Baby just give me something
I just need you one last time

[Pre-Chorus]
It's never ending
Never ending
All these feelings
Staring at the ceiling
So I just put the car in drive

[Chorus]
I'm running away, I'm running away
From this mess we made
I gotta find you, I gotta find you
I gotta find you, I gotta find you
I'm chasing right behind you
I need to remind you
I'm running away, I'm running away
I'm running away, I'm running away
From this mess I made
I'm running away, I'm running away
From this mess we made
I gotta find you, I gotta find you
I gotta find you, I gotta find you
I'm chasing right behind you
I need to remind you
I'm running away, I'm running away
I'm running away, I'm running away
From this mess I made
