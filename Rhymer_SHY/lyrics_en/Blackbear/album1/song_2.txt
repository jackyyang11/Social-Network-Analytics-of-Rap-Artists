[Verse]
You thought I wouldn't come around to you, 'round to you
You know I was down for you, down for you
Now I'm wishing that I never bowed to you, bowed to you
I'm in this shit I can't get out of I ain't proud
I hate the sound of all these songs 'bout you, songs about you
You know I was wrong 'bout you, wrong about you
Let you hold on to this cash let ya hold on to
I'm in this shit I can't get out of, I ain't proud of

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm running out of time to hold you close
Running out of time to be your man
I'm just lost in this moment
I've been zoning
I'm running out of time to hold you down
Running out of time to be your man
I'm just lost in this moment
I've been zoning

[Chorus]
You know that I could get you more, a little more
Whatever you need, what you need
I could get you more, a little more
Whatever you need
Yeah, ah
Yeah, ah

[Verse]
You thought I wouldn't come around to you, 'round to you
You know I was down for you, down for you
Now I'm wishing that I never bowed to you, bowed to you
I'm in this shit I can't get out of I ain't proud
I hate the sound of all these songs 'bout you, songs about you
You know I was wrong 'bout you, wrong about you
Let you hold on to this cash let ya hold on to
I'm in this shit I can't get out of, I ain't proud of

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm running out of time to hold you close
Running out of time to be your man
I'm just lost in this moment
I've been zoning
I'm running out of time to hold you down
Don't got the time to be your man
I'm just lost in this moment
I've been zoning, but

[Chorus]
You know that I could get you more, a little more
Whatever you need, what you need
I could get you more, a little more
Whatever you need, oh
Yeah, yeah

I could get you more, a little more
Oh yeah

[Bridge]
When I needed you the most, I needed you
When I needed you the most, I needed you the most
Now I won't be there to give you what you need
I won't be there no, no, no

[Outro]
And if you can't see whats in front of you, you lose
And if you can't see whats in front of you, you lose
And if you can't see whats in front of you, you lose
And if you can't see whats in front of you, you lose
