[Verse 1]
All these pictures that we taken
I know one day I'll be cropped out
And I know you coppin feelins
I got money put your card down, down

[Hook 1]
But you look so good on my arm, goddamn
Girl you know it, girl you notice
Go and give me the best you've got tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
If you take a little sip of this I know you gon feel right
And if you come through with your bitches I know my homies gon treat em right
Whoa, yeah

[Chorus]
And I won't fall, till I get it
Till I get it, oh
And I won't fall
I want you, I want you, I ain't trippin bout a damn thing
And I won't fall, till I get it, oh
Yeah, and I won't fall
I want you, I want you, I ain't trippin bout a damn thing

[Verse 2]
All this money I be spendin I know one day I'll be shopped out
Three or four carats on that rock, you gon rock with me, whoa

[Hook 2]
But you look so good out them jeans, goddamn
Girl you notice, girl I notice
Imma give you the best you gon get tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
If you take a little sip of this I know you gon feel right, (you gon feel right,)
And if you come through with your bitches I know my homies gon treat em right
(Hit the spot,)
Whoa, yeah

[Chorus]
And I won't fall, till I get it
Till I get it, oh

I want you, I want you, I ain't trippin bout a damn thing
And I won't fall, till I get it, oh

I want you, I want you, I ain't trippin bout a damn thing

[Outro]
I ain't trippin bout a damn thing
I ain't trippin bout a damn thing
I ain't trippin bout a damn thing
