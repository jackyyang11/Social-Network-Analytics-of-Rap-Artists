Intro
(Fge Shit fuck with me)

Body on burner (what you know about it)
Hot nigga, no Bobby Shmurda
Test bitch I'm passing out a lot of lead
And you don't need a pencil to be a learner
Find me layin' hands on yo bitch back-side
The girl bad I had to give her some act right
(Yea) after that you know its nap time
Pussy so wet I thought I got baptized
Gawd Shit yea the one that can't deny it
Ain't no sense to wonder why cuz it really don't matter when its divine shit
Let it seep in your mind see i opened your eyes lids
Shine some light inside your window
While they pull a hoax me and my brothers really get it in though
Pray i don't have to pull another kick door
I'm headed where I'm going but what made me is where i been though
And the flow rapture I kick the shit like a karate master
Another body another chapter and they ain't prepared for whats coming after
But when it god flow, there's nothing to stop it that's on the pastor
Boy this shit hotter than the thanksgiving kitchen in the summer time
Like Frankenstein how i'm making shit come alive what they pay to see
Niggas hate the team but like next up to me can’t nobody fuck with mine nigga
And incase you ain't heard the news we them dudes  and you know how move with them tools
Like we into fixing and like Willie Dixon nigga every time they sing it’s the blues
Yea only murder from a southside nigga get a smile
Like the joker when your mouth wide nigga or let mr spearkers bang like a alpine nigga
Don’t let the heavens hear your mommas out cry nigga
Yea that’s truth so let it speak I know it hurt but nigga im the streets  and the church so thats why everytime
I speak it feel like I gotta preach like handing out s.a.t’s I been giving boys that work
Ill admit ill admit fge we in the building we the business and we here to tear shit down tell the tenants
We the demolishing
Yea im a killer this a killing they probably talk about it but I really live it
If I showed you the flip side of the corn you will see it ain't a difference
Yea cuz I been really popping shit boy so watch your pitch it already be a hit boy
Straight from the hip yea im aiming at the fence boy and you don’t wanna see how far it really get boy
Cuz we ride and I won't play with you open up and let the k hit you
Ever seen the beef deeped fried
And shoutout to my city I know you hating motherfuckers living it
Till im in the dirt im going excerpt apply pressure to you niggas feel it
Yea its all part of the mission watch how every move I make a million
Like we attacking mailmen yea all my dogs chasing paper with me
And the shit don’t stop no slow full throttle even when we at the top though nigga
Tell them boys we don’t fuck around  butting for your crib with more hoes than a brothel nigga
Grattatata
