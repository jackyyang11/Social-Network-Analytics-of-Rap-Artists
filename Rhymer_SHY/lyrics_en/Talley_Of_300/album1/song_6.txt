[Hook]
You done pushed the hate too far
Look what you done did now
Brought the monster back to life
Got something to fear now
Shoulda watched what you said
Now it's off with your head, you can walk with the dead
Would you have walked in this way
If you knew your fate and that you couldn't escape

[Verse 1]
Murder, that murder
And I don't mean a vegetable when you turn up
Lifeless, niggas claim their heart froze
Till they find out I'm a ice pick, knife shit
Down for catching bodies like I'm thotty
Box your A and then you're F'd, Abercrombie
Top chef chop 'em up, yeah how I get 'em done, yeah
Fork in your grille, Maserati, yeah
A nightmare once I pick a night, yeah
And wherever I find you I'ma leave you right there
Swimmin' nigga, with this lemon nigga
Squeeze on you turn you to a fish dinner nigga
Only lord knows what the fuck got into niggas
But I know I'ma be the one to put an end to niggas, finish niggas
That's mortal combat, you shouldn't comment
You gon' get smoked, and whoever close gon' catch the contact
And you could pawn that

[Hook]
You done pushed the hate too far
Look what you done did now
Brought the monster back to life
Got something to fear now
Shoulda watched what you said
Now it's off with your head, you can walk with the dead
Would you have walked in this way
If you knew your fate and that you couldn't escape

[Verse 2]
And I won't rest until your eyes closed
Uplift your spirit get your mind blown
I pray hard 'bout this murder, when shit wasn't on my heart
But you fuck niggas deserve it and I'm swervin'
It ain't awe when I clench the stick and draw down
Rip you apart who knows you could be a star now
The game is war and I'm here to play your heart out
My defense flagrant and I plan to do 'em all foul
Want a piece but you ain't found a crumb, beef I ground it up
Light bulb on the ceiling how I'm lit rounding 'em up
Hurricane, I'm a wave, let this clip swallow 'em up
I'm a flood bitch and they gon' find your mug in the mud
Ain't no love, bitch and it's gon' rain blood when I'm done
Clouds of sorrow gon' cover the sun
And I'ma send a prayer up for your sun but
Your time has come nigga
Red rum nigga

[Hook]
You done pushed the hate too far
Look what you done did now
Brought the monster back to life
Got something to fear now
Shoulda watched what you said
Now it's off with your head, you can walk with the dead
Would you have walked in this way
If you knew your fate and that you couldn't escape

[Outro]
Murder, that murder
Murder, that murder
Murder, that murder
