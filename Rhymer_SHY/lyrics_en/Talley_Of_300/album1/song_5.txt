[Intro]
Yeah
TO3
Lord's Baptiste, September 19th
Get into this
Yeah, murder
Yeah

[Verse]
Last nigga that I shottied, ain't fuckin' nigga
Just know I'mma make sure you don't be so lucky nigga
Been hearing everything you say, ain't say nothin' nigga
Cuz it's just stick talk with me, ain't no discussion nigga
Bang-bow
Yeah we more than lay that murder game down
They wild
Till them lions come and see what they about
Bring em' out
Know them missiles in attendance when we prowl
Talkin' loud
I'm not satisfied till they can't make a sound
Bitch I'm tryna hear your last breath
I'll put a pricetag on your address
And we only come for blood, don't want no assets
Hit a bitch, forget the bitch, like it was bad sex
Graveyard music
Fuck, what made y'all do it?
It's gon' rain, and that pain, I'm gon' bring y'all through it
See the afterlife soon, at the rate y'all movin'
How my team do hits and make a baseball movie
Bitch, it's 30 or none
Don't get stuck in the mud
Have you throwin' up blood like you fuckin' with cubs
Push your shit back like a sub
Leave you wet like the tub
Then walk away, leavin' shells like I'm Reverend Run
Then I'll kill everybody like you, yeah bitch I'm the one
With a mask, gloves, and gun, I'm a storm in the sun
In broad day it could hail
Then I take em' to hell
You better think about your momma not takin' it well
Or I could put you on display like I made you for sale
Or make em' have to find your ass off of tracin' your smell
Either way, like you stole a blunt, you takin' a L
Sayin' hello from the other side, like your name Adele
Better watch your words nigga
Cuz like a bum, you could rest on the curb nigga
Yeah I'm fly and I'm crazy, cuckoo bird nigga
If that ain't what you heard, then fuck what you heard nigga
Bout to fuck a block up with this new toy
Got no problem with that drama, I'm a Rule Boy
My side is grippin', 50 kickin', like Riyu boy
Like Japanese homes, take you out your shoes boy
See I never play 'round
Even at the playground
Don't know what it was, but niggas always brought the hay 'round
Then I gripped the tre' pound
Musclin' the weight now
If niggas ain't from 'round here, they better know they way 'round
My G-Unit got a 50 in it
Yeah, they never there when I'm really with it
I pop out while I'm gettin' spinach
Leave that ass wet and naked like you skinny dippin'
Grrahh!
