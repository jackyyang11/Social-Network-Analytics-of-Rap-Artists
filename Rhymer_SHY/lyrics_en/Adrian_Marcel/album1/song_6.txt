[Verse 1]
My girl keep calling my phone
And I don’t even wanna answer right now
If she knew what I was doing in this bed
She would have a heart attack right now
I met a chick up in DOA
Say she wanna leave here with me
Hit the W a quarter past three
Showin' me she’s a certified freak

[Hook]
It’s crazy how she worked that back
The way she worked that back
Ain't fair how shawdy, put it on me like that
I be like wait, hollup, still ain't catch your name
She ain't move her mouth her body said

[Chorus]
I’m your temptation, give you sensations
Nobody has to know
Girl I swear you got a nigga caught up, up, up, up
You gon' fuck around and get me caught up, up, up, up, up, up
Even though I got a girl at the crib
When I see you I just wanna get it in
Girl, you got me caught up, up, up, up, up, up

[Verse 2]
See we been at it for a week by now
Matter of fact we in the sheets right now
It's too late for me to turn back
‘Cause I’m in too deep right now
She got me creeping out late at night
How can something so wrong feel right?
Booty soft, but her body’s so tight
She let me kiss her anywhere I like

[Hook]

[Chorus]

[Phone]
Hello?
Wassup baby?
Nah I'm at the studio right now
N- nah, it's the.. it's the music in the back, ain't nobody in.. nah ain't nobody in the background
Well look, let me hit you back tho
I love you

[Chorus]
