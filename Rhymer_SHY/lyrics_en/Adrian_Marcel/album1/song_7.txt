[Hook]
I've been riding in my chevy truck
I'mma slide on you and see what's up
You get mad 'cause I don't call enough
A broke nigga got the time to spend
And I ain't here
I've been doing way too much
I've been smoking way too much
When I hit you, you know what's up
When I hit you, you know what's up

[Verse 1]
All this money on me
All these women on me
This lifestyle can be so addictive sometimes
Fucked around and go
Got that platinum on my mind
But I'm still thinking of you
Been around this globe
Girl, I'm still dreaming of you
You capture my soul
Girl, I hope that you stay down
You ain't one of these hoes
You the one that I know
You the one for this song

[Hook]
I've been riding in my chevy truck
I'mma slide on you and see what's up
You get mad 'cause I don't call enough
A broke nigga got the time to spend
And I ain't here
I've been doing way too much
I've been smoking way too much
When I hit you, you know what's up
When I hit you, you know what's up

[Verse 2]
Don't give that pussy to a lame nigga
'Cause they ain't gonna do you like I do you, babe
If you ever let me, you gon' boomerang
I know your emotions like an elevator
They go up and down, go up and down
When you up and down on me
Riding all on me, telling me that you'll never leave
Feeling all on your inside, you're only nasty for me, girl
I love it, I appreciate you

[Hook] x2
I've been riding in my chevy truck
I'mma slide on you and see what's up
You get mad 'cause I don't call enough
A broke nigga got the time to spend
And I ain't here
I've been doing way too much
I've been smoking way too much
When I hit you, you know what's up
When I hit you, you know what's up
