[Verse 1]
Woke up to my phone ringing, 4 in the am
My girl keep blowing up my phone saying shit
Playing with a chick who just touched down
She from town, she rode over and I told her don't say shit
Press that green button, yeah I know it was suicide
Heart's beating like a bullet out of that .45
Voice to my ear like a shattered chandelier
I was thinking tell the truth or tell a lie, man it's do or die

[Chorus]
Standing at the edge of trouble, heart's at judgement day
She won't see it eats my soul away
I could say a thousand love yous, not much I can change
But in the end, I'll still be the devil, story of a fallen angel

[Verse 2]
How could you after all the things I did with you?
Even after all the things I did for you
How could you lay up with that bitch?
You claim you loyal
Thinking to myself, how she know this shit?
[?]
No worries yeah, I'm pleading the fifth
She hit it right on target, still I never admit I hurt her
Knock on the door, I get it
Home girl looked a little scared
This the boy, you better gon' and get the door
Couldn't even get her out of bed for the nap time

[Chorus]
Standing at the edge of trouble, heart's at judgement day
She won't see it eats my soul away
I could say a thousand love yous, not much I can change
But in the end, I'll still be the devil, story of a fallen angel
