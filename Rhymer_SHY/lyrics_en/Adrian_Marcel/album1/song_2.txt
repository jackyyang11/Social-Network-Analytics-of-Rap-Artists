Dear love

Lately I lately I, been thinking
Tears rolling deeper swear I been sinking
Girl I know I made a big mistake
But It ain't posed to be this way
I want ya, what I would give to have you closer
I'm drunk with the pain,with you I'm sober I'm sober
Hey

Do you miss me like I miss you girl I miss you you
You know I haven't seen you wanna hold you wanna kiss you
It's funny how you used to love me again no mo'
Love was fire how it get so cold
Day you left is when you took my soul
Day you left is when you took my soul

Went by The house you wasn't home
I called your phone you didn't answer
I'm saying girl,I wanna know
Do you think of me, that's why I wrote this letter
Girl, I'm so alone, girl we belong, together
I'm saying girl, I wanna know, do you think of me

So I'm sending you a 4 page letter
(Hey had to write this letter baby)

(Woaaahhh ooooh)

Baby girl baby girl, I need ya
I don't know why, I deceived ya
Damn I had my debt up on display
I didn't have to be that way yeah
I want ya, if love is a spell, then I'm on ya
I'm numb with the pain so I roll up, I roll up oh girl


Do you miss me like I miss you girl I miss you you
You know I haven't seen you wanna hold you wanna kiss you
It's funny how you used to love me again no mo'
Love was fire how it get so cold
Day you left is when you took my soul
Day you left is when you took my soul

By The house you wasn't home
I called your phone you didn't answer
I'm saying girl, I wanna know
Do you think of me, that's why I wrote this letter
