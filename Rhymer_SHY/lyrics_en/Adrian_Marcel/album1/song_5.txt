[INTRO]

Adrian Imma tell you like bae told me
Always have you second move
Before you make your first

[VERSE 1 :Adrian Marcel]

It's his fault
Coming down
Faded
Need another round
Can't stop thinking
I just wanna drown in my own shoes
So tonight I'm gonna get you
Cause somewhere down the line when I was loving you
You had on these no shoes
And I can see it in your eyes you wasn't the same
Girl
I gave you my all
Never thought it will be this way
I guess I was wrong

[HOOK]

And you probly won't remember half the things I'll never forget
Like when you broke my heart
Awkward moments
And you'll probly won't remember half the things I'll never forget
You left me all alone
Awkward moments

[VERSE 2: Adrian Marcel]

You and him at his crib
It explains all the shit you was getting in (now its finally sinking)
Every time i brought you around
H was checking you out
You started changing your tone
I caught you texting his phone
It didn't take much to realize
Something was strange
Girl i can't believe
Why you have to be this way
You was playing games

[HOOK]

[VERSE 3: Mase]

At this level that all those dummies would
Take you to the mall and blow condo money
