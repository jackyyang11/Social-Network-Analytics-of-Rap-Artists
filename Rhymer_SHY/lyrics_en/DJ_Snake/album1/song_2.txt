[Verse 1: Lauv]
Could you believe, I could be different?
I'll be the difference, I'll lift you high
And I understand your hesitation
My reputation, it's no surprise

[Chorus: Lauv]
I will come running when you call my name
Even a broken heart can beat again
Forget about the one who caused you pain
I swear I'll love you in a different way
Different way
Different way
Different way
I swear I'll love you in a different way

[Drop]

[Post-Chorus]
I swear I'll love you in a different way
I swear I'll love you in a different way
I swear I'll love you in a different way

[Chorus: Lauv]
I will come running when you call my name
Even a broken heart can beat again
Forget about the one who caused you pain
I swear I'll love you in a different way
Different way
Different way
I swear I'll love you in a different way

[Drop]

[Post-Chorus]
I swear I'll–
I swear I'll love you
I swear I'll love you in a different way
I swear I'll–
I swear I'll love you in a different way
I swear I'll love you in a different way
