[Verse 1]
Lover of mine, how have you been?
'Cause it's been a while since the summer began
Where did it go? Done in a flash
Something on my mind keeps on bringing me back
To us, back to us
'Cause I feel like someone else all by myself, all by myself

[Pre-Chorus]
Pulling on my sweatshirt, looking at your picture
'Cause that broken summer's hanging over me
Drowning in the sunshine, and I spend a long time
Thinking girl, you got the best of me
Hopping on a flight, then make it back to Austin
Finding I get lost in all them Autumn leaves
I just walk around now, stranger in my hometown
Broken summer's hanging over me

[Chorus]
Broken summer, broken summer
Broken summer, broken summer

[Verse 2]
Lover of mine, what would it take?
Could I walk the miles off of all our mistakes?
I'm getting tired, too far away
Though I keep on trying, it keeps taking me back
To us, back to us
'Cause I feel like someone else, all by myself, all by myself

[Pre-Chorus]
Pulling on my sweatshirt, looking at your picture
'Cause that broken summer's hanging over me
Drowning in the sunshine, and I spend a long time
Thinking girl, you got the best of me
Hopping on a flight, then make it back to Austin
Finding I get lost in all them Autumn leaves
I just walk around now, stranger in my hometown
Broken summer's hanging over me

[Chorus]
Broken summer, broken summer
Broken summer, broken summer
Broken summer, broken summer
Broken summer, broken summer

[Bridge]
Back to us
'Cause I'm bringing me back to us
Bringing me back to us
Keeps on bringing me back to us
Back to us
'Cause I'm bringing me back to us
Bringing me back to us
Keeps on bringing me back, back

[Chorus]
Broken summer, broken summer
Broken summer, broken summer
