[Intro: Bipolar Sunshine]
All night long, all night long

[Chorus: Bipolar Sunshine]
My future looks brighter in your eyes
So if I ever realize, I don't blame the fire, you're mine
And we go all night long, all night long
And sometimes through the day
My future looks brighter in your eyes

[Breakdown: DJ Snake]

[Verse 2: Bipolar Sunshine]
I'm lookin' forward, you're lookin' back
Help me pick out our next adventure on the map
Let's take it all in, let's catch a vibe
You give me feelings that I only reach when high
So bae, I'll make it easy, I'll make you mine
A little trouble in my heart, it makes you glad
You got me always, champagne and wine
But even when I sleep, somehow you rule my mind
Oh lately

[Chorus: Bipolar Sunshine]
My future looks brighter in your eyes
So if I ever realize, I don't blame the fire, you're mine
And we go all night long, all night long
And sometimes through the day
My future looks brighter in your eyes

[Breakdown: DJ Snake]

[Outro: Bipolar Sunshine]
Oh, the start, you'll be there in the end
And take me back again
You're the perfect end
All night...
All night...
