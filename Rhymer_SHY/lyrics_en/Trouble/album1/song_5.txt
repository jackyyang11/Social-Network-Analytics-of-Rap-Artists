[Intro: Trouble]
Ain't nobody studyin' these lil pissy ass lil hoes man
That bitch know what the fuck going on

[Chorus: Trouble]
Bitch I知 the shit, bitch look at this
Got a brick on my wrist, bitch look at this
This a brick (yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
This a brick (yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah)
Bitch talking shit, big boy get hit
Come through, shit gon' get lit
Snowball on your wrist
That's a brick (yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
Goddamnit that's a brick (yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: Trouble]
Thirty-six, thirty-six, thirty-six, this bitch thick
Brick on my wrist, I talk shit, suck my dick ho
Bitch ain't shit change, in the bricks with the jits ho
Licks, after licks, after licks, after licks, go
I told that bitch I don稚 know what to tell her
That shit you talking 'bout don't add up to a bezel
I get this shit brackin', I知 poppin kettle
Wasn't nothin' at first, put that bitch together
She wasn't nothin' at first, put that bitch together
If I don稚 like the weather, I change the weather
Get a nigga knocked off, it just cost a feather
Brick on my wrist, nigga know I知 better, Skoob

[Chorus: Trouble]
Bitch I知 the shit, bitch look at this
Got a brick on my wrist, bitch look at this
This a brick (yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
This a brick (yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah)
Bitch talking shit, big boy get hit
Come through, shit gon' get lit
Snowball on your wrist
That's a brick (yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
Goddamnit that's a brick (yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Skippa Da Flippa]
AP cost a brick, chain cost a brick
Skoob drink a fifth, Flip gon' drop another six
A hundred thousand for the ice
Reach for my jewelry you might lose your life
Diamonds hittin', I make movies like Spike
Bust down wedding ring but I have no wife
Bricks on me, brick fare, blocks on me but no Telfair
Ice on me look like Kenmore
Stack, pray, and stay away from squares
I had to go harder to get some new water
Rollie look like a glacier from Antarctica
Bitch I知 the shit because my bag comes in larger
Box Chevy, Flippa never get the MARTA

[Chorus: Trouble]
Bitch I知 the shit, bitch look at this
Got a brick on my wrist, bitch look at this
This a brick (yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
This a brick (yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah)
Bitch talking shit, big boy get hit
Come through, shit gon' get lit
Snowball on your wrist
That's a brick (yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
Goddamnit that's a brick (yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah)
