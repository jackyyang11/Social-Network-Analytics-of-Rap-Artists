[Verse 1]
Think it's a game, don't advise you put my name on wax
Gooniez shoot off them same lips that put my name on a track
While I just sit back and sing them lullabies (Rockabye baby)
Another pussy die
On the pill I got from Fat Mack strategizing for my empire
I'm a asshole by nature just like Trae Tha Truth it's spitting fire
And I'm not a lie
Want to put me under the test
Then grab the .357 the murder weapon just to let you niggas know I ain't flexin'
No shell casings to pick up so I ain't worried about you catching me
Was taught don't talk about shit so I ain't worried about a snitch
Now I can do like my big homies used to do
Just for the rush with automatics it's a house move don't forget to blast

[Hook]
Bussin!
They all bussin for Trouble Trouble
They all bussin for Trouble Trouble
They all bussin for Trouble Trouble
OG's, young niggas, niggas younger than them
Bussin!
They all bussin for Trouble Trouble
They all bussin for Trouble Trouble
They all bussin for Trouble Trouble
OG's, young niggas, niggas younger than them
Bussin!

[Verse 2]
Salute to my fam who shoot every time Trouble Trouble tell 'em to
Salute to my niggas who shoot just to say I did it
'Cuz I fucks with you
Real battlefield Wayne Perry type of beef
You the type to tuck your chain I'm tryna make a name
(Watch this x3)
Watch this, watch this, watch this
Some emotions going to be hit (They gon' be hit)
Watch this, watch this, watch this
Get at me you gonna get spinned
Big dog Trouble no mercy that's the code
Only mob members and mercs will do anything (I know x3)
I touch down and cause hell out of that jail cell
December 17th 2011 with some killers reppin'
And all my dogs ain't no peons, we all bosses
It's just their precision to make your families hate them losses

[Hook]

They all bussin for Trouble Trouble
They all bussin for Trouble Trouble
