[Hook]
Ahh man, god damn
Ahh man, took a loss
Don’t even wanna answer my jack
I just keep on screening my calls
Ahh man, can’t do that
Family need a nigga too bad
Naw nigga, can’t do that
Nigga need the money too bad

[Hook]
Ahh man, god damn
Ahh man, took a loss
Don’t even wanna answer my jack
I just keep on screening my calls
Ahh man, can’t do that
Family need a nigga too bad
Naw nigga, can’t do that
Nigga need the money too bad

[Verse 1]
Granny calling for the Percs
This no lie, her body hurt
I guess the system just ain’t showing no love
I got her a pack off the street though
Bitches gossiping like always
Can't give attention to ‘em, sister call ‘em
My partner think a hundred thou balling
My nieces love they big dog regardless
Sometimes I be blaming myself
For the doubt I brought down on myself
Beat the fuck nigga down to his death
Won’t say nothing while you flex, tryna rep
Already done did my lil bid
I ain’t got me nothing to prove
Already showed you that I'll go in your shit bitch
Don’t try the Skoob
Hey, hey hey, just let me be cool
A new set of rules, a new set of jewels
Guess that make you the dude
Hey, hey hey, I go by the old rules
Go take care your family, go sit down your parents
But that just Skoob

[Hook]
Ahh man, god damn
Ahh man, took a loss
Don’t even wanna answer my jack
I just keep on screening my calls
Ahh man, can’t do that
Family need a nigga too bad
Naw nigga, can’t do that
Nigga need the money too bad

[Hook]
Ahh man, god damn
Ahh man, took a loss
Don’t even wanna answer my jack
I just keep on screening my calls
Ahh man, can’t do that
Family need a nigga too bad
Naw nigga, can’t do that
Nigga need the money too bad

[Verse 2]
Mama calling, talkin’ ‘bout pops fainted
You wonder why a nigga still drinking
I wonder why the nigga Suge singing
Got my lil partner, them ships sinking
Three of my close little woadies
And we just getting older and older
Yeen asking shit ‘bout the weight on my shoulders
Then fuck nigga how can I owe you
They always gon’ want some my handout
Don’t try to say I didn’t coach you
Bitches be playin' they part on a nigga like they done got the camera rollin'
They make it different then it’s s’posed to
Be careful who you let the closest
I open doors and should’ve closed em
Ungrateful niggas be the worst

[Hook]
Ahh man, god damn
Ahh man, took a loss
Don’t even wanna answer my jack
I just keep on screening my calls
Ahh man, can’t do that
Family need a nigga too bad
Naw nigga, can’t do that
Nigga need the money too bad

[Hook]
Ahh man, god damn
Ahh man, took a loss
Don’t even wanna answer my jack
I just keep on screening my calls
Ahh man, can’t do that
Family need a nigga too bad
Naw nigga, can’t do that
Nigga need the money too bad
