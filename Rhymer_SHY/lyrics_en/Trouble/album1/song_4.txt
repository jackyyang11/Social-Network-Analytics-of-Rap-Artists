I keep coming back after back like them j’s when that raw on the scale
The streets they been talkin and watching they say Skoob gettin them muthafuckin bales
C’mon wit ya lil interrogation nigga I ain’t got nothin to tell
I feel like motherfuck 12 and free all my podnuhs from jail
Plenty nights out on the trail - flipping like she do her nails
I fuck with anything get it off - it just can’t be red as Lavelle
Do u not know bout that yayo, that yayo get u so many years
Gotta thank the lord for appeals cuz my podnuh was doing a L

My podnuh doin’ a L cuz a pussy boy pointed the finger
That’s why i stay to myself so nobody can point they lil finger
Had to cut off all the lil bitty bitches who really wasn’t bout shit
Had to cut off a few lil bitty niggas that i really rock wit (shit crazy)
You trade yo loyalty just for a moment
I’m at that paper you chasing that monkey
They don’t want no bread they just want some attention
Wanna be fresh but ain’t gettin at no bitches
You gotta be bout ya issue then come rock me like switches
You keep saying you want it, ain’t seen you go get it

I keep coming back after back like them j’s when that raw on the scale

You pussy niggas outchea sick wit it - cough up yo life for a deal
Reason i move like a seal - try me i shoot like a seal
Closing yo eyes tryna dream - i go get that shit like a fiend
Like a Patriot I’ll be cheatin - if that’s what take to be eatin’
If that’s what it take nigga thats what we doing
Fuck a pussy nigga hatin lets do it
If that’s what it take nigga thats what we doing
I”m bout that fetti you already knew it
