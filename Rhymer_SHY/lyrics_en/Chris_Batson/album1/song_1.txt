[Verse 1]
Think of your smile
You're all in my mind
Seen you in dreams multiple times
Can we rewind and take it back
Our love is damaged but my heart's intact

[Pre-Chorus]
Look at what we become
You've got me so undone
Look at what we become
You got me so undone

[Chorus]
I crash and I burn
She's out of love
And it's what I deserve, it's what I deserve
She'll never return, she's out of love
And it's what I deserve, it's what I deserve
I know I know
I know I know

[Verse 2]
I'm all alone within my own hell I try to keep it a secret but I know you can tell
You're all in my soul and my soul ain't for sale
You're out love the heartache is real

[Pre-Chorus]
Look at what we become
You've got me so undone
Look at what we become
You got me so undone

[Chorus]
I crash and I burn
She's out of love
And it's what I deserve, it's what I deserve
She'll never return, she's out of love
And it's what I deserve, it's what I deserve
I know I know
I know I know

[Bridge]
I know I know
I know I know
