She left her mind in New Orleans in the passenger of a maverick
She got so drunk and got so high
She got lost in the magic
This white girl is average but you know she gonna treat you right
But you know she gonna treat you right
And I know that you
Tryna find yourself in the nightlife
And the nightlife feels so right
Right?
You wanna get high you wanna get high you wanna get high
You wanna get high you wanna get high you wanna get high

Tell me why you wanna get faded
Tell me while your tears hit the pavement
We can run away in a spaceship
And never come back
Told her that you gotta be brave when
You think that you're not gonna make it
We can run away in a spaceship
And never come back
And never come back
And never come back
And never come back
And never come back

She on her last cigarette
Knowing that she still in debt
She would've took her life a long time ago but she dont know what comes after death
She grew up in the churches but she thinks that its all worthless can you hear me god. I didn't think so. I didn't think so
Now she sittin here
Tryna find herself in the nightlife
And the nightlife feels so right, right?
You wanna get high you wanna get high you wanna get high
You wanna get high you wanna get high you wanna get high

Chorus
