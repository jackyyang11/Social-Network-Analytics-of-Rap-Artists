DRYING MY EYES IN THE PASSENGER SEAT OF MY OWN CAR I’M DRUNK RIGHT NOW BUT I THINK I’LL HEAD TO THE NEXT BAR
I’M BLUE
I’M BLUE

YOU CAN SMELL THE CIGARETTES I WAS SMOKING ALL NIGHT LONG
HAVE A COUPLE DRINKS OF JACK DANIEL’S BEFORE IT’S GONE
I CAN BARELY THINK RIGHT NOW LET ALONE DRIVE HOME
GUESS I’M MEANT TO BE ALONE
I CAN’T EVEN THINK ABOUT A TIME
WHEN EVERYTHING WAS FINE


I LEFT MY HOME LAST NIGHT
THINK I WANNA GO AWAY
BECAUSE THIS TOWN DON’T FEEL RIGHT
NO TELLING WHERE I’LL BE TODAY
I WONDER WHY I STAYED SO LONG RIGHT HERE RIGHT HERE RIGHT HERE
I CAN’T REMEMBER WHEN I HAD THIS KIND OF FEAR
LAST CALL FOR ALCOHOL
DO YOU REMEMBER ME AT ALL


THE GUN IS LOADED AND READY WHILE I’M HOLDING IT STEADY
YOU SAY YOU’RE GLAD THAT YOU LEFT ME WELL NOW YOU’LL NEVER FORGET ME
