[Intro: Amy Heidemann] (x4)
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1: Amy Heidemann]
Turn me up, rock steady
D-D-D-Disk right here, so heavy
Blow this joint, confetti
F-F-F-Free fall like Tom Petty
Are you ready? 'Cause
Eight pounds and all the five ounces
Here in the fight and destiny pounces
Born in the storm, call me a rival
You see, I bring thunder wherever I go
Into the room, ladies go boom
Gotta sip drink and I [?] with a view
[?]
Music on my chest like, woo!

[Chorus: Karmin]
Everywhere we go
They stop and look at us
Like "Who they think they are?"
We hear 'em talking but
Don't mean a thing to me
Go 'head and let 'em hate
We're doing what we do
We're here to celebrate

[Post-Chorus: Amy Heidemann (Nick Noonan]
(Boom, boom, boom)
We're going up like
(Boom, boom, boom)
So turn it up like
(Boom, boom, boom)
Dirty it up like
(Boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom, boom)

[Verse 2: Amy Heidemann]
Doo-doo-doo-drop top throwback Chevy
W-W-W-Wild child style, Serengeti
Make that cake, Crocker Betty
[?], so sweaty
Are you ready? 'Cause
Everybody gotta start somewhere
With the track to the top, black tie affair
[?]
[?] fog machines
[?], busting out scenes
[?]

[Chorus + Post-Chorus]

[Bridge]
Always gonna be someone who
Wanna steal your thunder and take you down
We blowing up no matter what they do, do, do
Like b-boom, boom, boom

[Chorus + Post-Chorus] (x2)
