[Verse 1]
Experts at eighteen
With warm beer and caffeine
We spoke all night and hung out
'Til the first light would come on
Knew it was over, the morning came sober
We said goodbye and then we smiled through a lie
Just thinkin'

[Chorus]
All the words we never said
All the crazy things we did
Keep on playin' in my head
And although this is the end
Broken hearts are made to mend
And I know we値l meet again

[Verse 2]
Days turn to weeks, yeah
We've all cut our teeth so
We keep in touch although we don't talk much
I knew we'd find us some new friends
Life changes, it happens
But we're still crazy for those good old days we had
Just singing

[Chorus]
All the words we never said
All the crazy things we did
Keep on playin' in my head
And although this is the end
Broken hearts are made to mend
And I know we値l meet again

[Post-Chorus]
Along the road
Along the road

[Bridge]
Some will lose their way
Vanish in the haze
But as the sun goes down
I sometimes think about
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
All the words we never said
All the crazy things we did
Keep on playin' in my head
And although this is the end
Broken hearts are made to mend
And I know we値l meet again
Along the road

[Chorus]
All the words we never said
All the crazy things we did
Keep on playin' in my head
And although this is the end
Broken hearts are made to mend
And I know we値l meet again

[Post-Chorus]
Along the road
Along the road
