[Verse 1: SZA]
I know I wanted to be a pretty lover
I only wanted to be your undercover
And now you getting mad baby, now you're throwing fits
'Cause your phone ain't ringing like it used to
How do you feel?
Now you wanna take it back, now you wanna ghost somebody
Why you gotta treat me like that, you know you were somebody

[Refrain: SZA]
Suddenly I understand, when I call, when I come by
I don't need no man

[Chorus: SZA]
Suddenly you wish we were, back together
Telling me you wanna get, back together
Just the way you had me, was so much better
Say you didn't think it would be forever
(Ooh)

[Verse 2: SZA]
I don't know, I just, I have better things to do
Better men to call, better time to spend and-
How you [?] to getchu up, getchu up, getchu-
How do you look good, when you put it like that?
How do you look good, when you put it like-
How you [?] to getchu up, getchu up, getchu-
How do you look good, when you put it like that?
How do you look good, when you put it like-

[Refrain: SZA]
Suddenly I understand, when I call, when I come by
I don't need no man

[Chorus: SZA]
Suddenly you wish we were, back together
Telling me you wanna get, back together
Just the way you had me, was so much better
Say you didn't think it would be forever
(Ooh)

[Verse 3: SZA]
Hello? Yeah I hear you
Yeah, yeah, yeah I seen you calling
Six times, I don't know, I just
I have better things to do, pass the times it's-

[Refrain: SZA]
Suddenly I understand, when I call, when I come by
I don't need no man 'cause like, maybe

[Verse 3: SZA]
Maybe we get back, maybe we don't
Maybe we call, maybe it's gone
Maybe you'll love me, maybe you won't
(Ooh)
We'll see, come again, we can talk about it
Suddenly you wanna, call on, or love on, or hold on to my [?]
Well call them other girls
You can try, you can see, if it works, gladly
I'm a little bored, I gotta, little more things to entertain my time
And summer getting real close, weather getting real hot
Shorts getting real short, skin getting real tight

[Chorus 2: SZA]
Back together
(I don't know the plans for you)
Back together
(I don't know the first place to begin gettin back to you)
So much better
(I think you've run this course)
Be forever
(I think you've reached the end of a line darling
I think you've reached the end)
Keep it classy, don't cry
I know it hurts, I know you want it
I know you long for the love
Too bad together sounds like, an old tune
Like a, holiday since passed
Just call, I won't answer no more

[Outro: SZA]
Back together
Back together
(I'm onto new things, new sounds, new feels, new times)
So much better
(And you old news)
Be forever
(You old news, I can't stand it)
(Ooh) I don't know, I just-
