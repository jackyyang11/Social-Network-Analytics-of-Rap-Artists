[Chorus: FKi 1st]
Hey, since a git, boy I knew I was the shit (I was the shit)
I went from riding big whips to foreign whips (They turnin')
All my girls used to be skinny now they thick
Started in momma basement now a nigga rich
Since a git I've been the shit (since a git we've been the shit)
Since a git I've been the shit (since a git we've been the shit)
Since a git I've been the shit

[Verse 1: Bankroll Fresh]
Since a git I've been the shit (Yea)
Knew I was the shit (I've been the shit nigga)
When I was a git (Nah, for real)
Back when I was a git (Yea, yea)
I was still the shit (Yea)
Fa' forward 14 years later, Bitch I'm still it (Yea)
All my hoes went from skin to thick, skin to thick
To bad as ever
Man I went from broke to rich
I'm talkin' 'bout racks on a schedule
All my whips got a B on it
New Chanel got a C on it
New Gucci got a G on it
Canary Yellow stones peed on it
Killed the mic when I breathe on it
Old school with the D's on it
Old school with the T's in it
Chevrolet with the bead in it (Switch it up)

And everyday money you ain't talking shit
I only got money on my fuckin' list
I only got money that's my only wish
Fill it with money back when I was just a git

[Chorus: FKi 1st]
Hey, since a git, boy I knew I was the shit (I was the shit)
I went from riding big whips to foreign whips (They turnin')
All my girls used to be skinny now they thick
Started in momma basement now a nigga rich
Since a git I've been the shit (since a git we've been the shit)
Since a git I've been the shit (since a git we've been the shit)
Since a git I've been the shit

[Verse 2: FKi 1st]
Hold up babe, it's time
[?] it's Atlanta [?] got on my shit list
Truthfully need to be on the hit list
I call my lil git got the stick
He'll pop that shit
Blow off [?]
And I ain't really about that life bruh I stay peaceful
Nigga 'bouta make me go into beast mode
All I see is evil, and only people
That's why I fuck with me, we and only we
I pour my heart and my soul in this shit, and went crazy at the same time
And I'll dive [?] first in that bitch
Gotta fall 'fore you fuckin' fly
And I swear never fuckin' lie
Cross a nigga like he's finish line
Models gotta be a double five
Make'em cum together and they intertwine
I started with my hand on her inner thigh
She looked at me and told me dinner time
[?]

[Chorus: FKi 1st]
Hey, since a git, boy I knew I was the shit (I was the shit)
I went from riding big whips to foreign whips (They turnin')
All my girls used to be skinny now they thick
Started in momma basement now a nigga rich
Since a git I've been the shit (since a git we've been the shit)
Since a git I've been the shit (since a git we've been the shit)
Since a git I've been the shit
