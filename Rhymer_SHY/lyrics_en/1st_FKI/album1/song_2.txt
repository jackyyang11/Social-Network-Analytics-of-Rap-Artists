[Intro: FKi 1st]
It's cool with me, it's forever
I'm just being me, yea
Sowoot, FKi

[Verse 1: FKi 1st]
Like this is how it go
Done with all these hoes
No more repetition
Different nights, same show
Only times they say I'm changing
And when a young nigga change clothes, change flows
Of how I went from broke to havin' a bank roll
Hunned killa case closed, beat the beat like I'm Jose Canseco
ATL back to the bayside
We could do it baby, we could do it
I've been smokin' so long that I stay high
But before, don't make me chop and screw it
Got me slurrin' like I'm at the dentist, man
Pour it up just like a chemist, man
Why you think they call us FKi
All we fuckin' do is kick it, niggas, yeah

[Refrain: Elkka & FKi 1st]
I shot her down, so there wasn't a chance (No, I'm just, I'm just doing what I do)
And then suddenly I had this perfection (Thank you for fucking with me)

[Verse 2: FKi 1st]
Smokin' big, I do it on a daily
Man I swear that this ain't no intermission
Usually not a drinker, I've been drinkin' lately
And my momma say I need an intervention
I don't think so though
It is help me deal with all my problems
So I just sit so low
It's what medicating marijuana
My nigga, we got locked up, and been so much drama
I love my girl, but she so pre-madonna
Try to do good, but can't afford your honor
Maybe if I wasn't a performer like
Days in the meadow, and not in this ghetto
So I stay high like falsetto
'Til I hear the echo

[Chorus: Elkka]
But I've been hurt by all the actors, I've seen it all before
Don't wanna let myself go, can't take it anymore
I've been hurt by all the actors, I'm making to resist
I don't know what this is
Yeah, I've been hurt by all the actors, I've seen it all before
Don't wanna let myself go, can't take it anymore
I've been hurt by all the actors, I'm making to resist
Darling tell me, does this really exist
Darling tell me, does this really exist
I didn't want to, didn't want to connect
I didn't need it, didn't need the affections

[Chorus: Elkka]
But I've been hurt by all the actors, I've seen it all before
Don't wanna let myself go, can't take it anymore
I've been hurt by all the actors, I'm making to resist
I don't know what this is
But I've been hurt by all the actors, I've seen it all before
I wanna let myself go, can't take it anymore
I've been hurt by all the echoes, I'm making to resist
Darling tell me, does this really exist
Darling tell me, does this really exist
I didn't want to, didn't want to connect
I didn't need it, didn't need the affections

[Refrain: Elkka & FKi 1st]
I shot her down there wasn't a chance
And then suddenly I had this perfection (Uh huh, yeah)

[Outro: FKi 1st]
Everybody, y'all 'ready know its [?] the label
I'm First, FKi, yea, yea
I'm just tryin' to elevate man, just keep moving, keep elevating
Keep meditating, keep making money, man
Just keep taking care of my family, like I actually give a shit forever
Taking over year
Watch us, 2016 and beyond
It's cool with me, it's forever
