[Chorus: FKi 1st & Njomza]
See I tried to be normal but that shit ain't work
I tried to fall in love she end up getting hurt
People sell their soul for a Versace shirt
I just wanna live for what its fuckin worth
How can I be rich and still stay down to earth
They say if you work you get what you deserve
Please don’t complain bruh it could be worse
I just wanna live for what it’s fuckin worth
Before I reach the (earth)

[Verse 1: FKi 1st]
The Georgia dirt is where my feet at
Everybody ask where I be at
Where the blunt where the smoke where the lean at
(I don’t know)
Bro I’m on that ATLien three stacks
See i ain't got no time for this party (no time no time)
We tryna swap out these Nissans for Ferraris
I'd rather buy ten houses than some Bugattis
I’m tryna make a check then learn some karate
Just watch me
I’m still walking around with the Vick
Throw a bitch around me I get to pick (got it)
I’m just tryna keep my candle lit
My son need a Lego kit every month his shirt don’t fit and his kicks don’t fit but he gotta get fed (whoa)
Next time a nigga sleep probably when a nigga dead

[Chorus: FKi 1st & Njomza]
See I tried to be normal but that shit ain't work
I tried to fall in love she end up getting hurt
People sell their soul for a Versace shirt
I just wanna live for what its fuckin worth
How can i be rich and still stay down to earth
They say if you work you get what you deserve
Please don’t complain bruh it could be worse
I just wanna live for what it’s fuckin worth
Before I reach the (earth)

[Verse 2: Njomza ]
Fuckin up my love like my name Kurt
Cause I don't got the time to cater and serve
To no other soul I’m being honest boy
To busy getting mine yeah I try, I try
To get it while I can while its in hands reach if you about your bread then I know you're yelling preach

[FKi 1st]
Okay
Because we all got the same mind set yeah yeah
Lets get it get it
If you in it then you in it in it
I’ll let you know when we finish
Hold up

[Njomza]
I just wanna live on an island
Matter fact might fuck around and just buy it
Have my family with me yeah we'll be chilling
It's gon happen because I got the vision , I see it

[Chorus: FKi 1st & Njomza]
See I tried to be normal but that shit ain't work
I tried to fall in love she end up getting hurt
People sell their soul for a Versace shirt
I just wanna live for what its fuckin worth
How can i be rich and still stay down to earth
They say if you work you get what you deserve
Please don’t complain bruh it could be worse
I just wanna live for what it’s fuckin worth
Before I reach the (earth)
