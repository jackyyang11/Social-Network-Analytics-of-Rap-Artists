[Chorus: FKi 1st]
Every saint has a past
Every sinner has a future
I don't care how you make your money
Nigga I salute you
I'm gon' die with two bitches naked doin' the kamasutra
It might not be okay with you
But it make me happy so I do it

Prove yourself to yourself, fuck everybody else, yeah
Prove yourself to yourself, fuck everybody else, yeah
Prove yourself to yourself, fuck everybody else, yeah
Prove yourself to yourself, fuck everybody else

[Verse 1: FKi 1st]
See, first off my nigga I ain't perfect
I'ma motherfuckin' hypocrite
See my momma just called, slipped and hung up the phone in the background
Aye bitch you mad? Shut the fuck up
When the fuck am I gon' change?
All these hoes call me immature
But I got big, big, bang, bang, bitch, I'ma change it like connoisseur [?]
If you gon' do it, do it big, nigga
If it work well, repeat it repeat it repeat it
And don't trust these fuck niggas if you get a contract let a lawyer read it
Ay, boy, you end up broke
They lookin' good in them suits but inside they some demons
They claimin' that they your folk but they twistin up the meanin
They so low down that they shame and, nigga, I ain't talkin' Keenen
Fuck it [?] fuck her [?]
The teacher said there's something wrong with me
And now we addicted to pharmacies
Vice after vice they don't never leave
I gotta stay up but I'm scared to sleep
Thankfully I'm of a better breed
Fuck the size of the dog, it's the pedigree
Me first, [?]
Big cheese died brough the dead with me [?]
Zuse full of money with the shipment [?]
But I tell the hoes they only worth a ten piece
See I'm smokin' to release the edge in me
Really I'm too smart for therapy
I'm just tryin' not to make the future my past
Devil on my ass, he tellin' me

[Chorus: FKi 1st]
Every saint has a past
Every sinner has a future
I don't care how you make your money
Nigga I salute you
I'm gon' die with two bitches naked doing the kamasutra
It might not be okay with you
But it make me happy so I do it

Prove yourself to yourself, fuck everybody else
Prove yourself to yourself, fuck everybody else
Prove yourself to yourself, fuck everybody else
Prove yourself to yourself, fuck everybody else

[Verse 2: Danny Seth]
*The British are coming*
Two seats, four women
Fuck the beat, I beat the op like raw denim
[?] inside the UK
[?] talked about me [?]
What the fuck did I tell you
I'm about to be flyin' [?] rebel
The flag from my country I came to US [?]
I swear no one touch me [?]
[?] still keep it 100
My team, 'oh so loyal I say jump, they bungee
I run it, my bruddah, like fitness
[?] stick [?] blunts with me
I'ma [?] whole time
Best believe that I'ma catch it like a frisbee
White boy keep killin' like a frenzy
Best believe I'm blowing up like a chimney

[Chorus: FKi 1st]
Every saint has a past
Every sinner has a future
I don't care how you make your money
Nigga I salute you
I'm gon' die with two bitches naked doing the kamasutra
It might not be okay with you
But it make me happy so I do it

Prove yourself to yourself, fuck everybody else
Prove yourself to yourself, fuck everybody else
Prove yourself to yourself, fuck everybody else
Prove yourself to yourself, fuck everybody else
