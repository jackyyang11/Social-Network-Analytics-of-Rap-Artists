I always knew
That you were hiding something from me
I always knew
You're not what you pretend to be
I always knew
That all your lies would come to light one day
But I never knew what it could do to me
My broken heart's become an engine
And my blood is pumping steel
I'm running wild with vengeance
I've lost control of this machine
There's no slowing down now
I'm a runaway train
My pistons are pounding
Brakes are screaming your name
And when there's nothing but wreckage and flames
And your misery is all that remains
I'll feel human again
But I'm a runaway train
I never knew
That I could have this kind of power
I never knew
That I could be the one to strike
I never knew
That all my love could turn to anger so fast
Show me what hatred is like
And now my chest is cold and empty
I've got steel instead of bone
The coals are burning inside me
So don't you dare think I won't
There's no slowing down now
I'm a runaway train
My pistons are pounding
Brakes are screaming your name
And when there's nothing but wreckage and flames
And your misery is all that remains
I'll feel human again
But I'm a runaway train
Red light flashing gears down
None of that will help you now
Lying face up on the tracks
Well you brought it here no turning back
You brought it here no turning back
There's no slowing down now
I'm a runaway train
My pistons are pounding
Brakes are screaming your name
And when there's nothing but wreckage and flames
And your misery is all that remains
I'll feel human again
But I'm a runaway train
