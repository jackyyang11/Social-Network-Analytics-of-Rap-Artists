One raindrop will stop 15 members from coming to church
One degree under 33 will freeze 32 members from coming to church (thats cold)
As much as He done for us
Is it so hard for us to wake up for church
Dont forsake the gathering
We can learn together we can pray together
One sitcom will stop us from 25 minutes of reading his word
What is the excuse we need to start studying to show ourselves approved
Rightly dividing the word of truth (the word of truth)
The only way we can grow is by studying His word (His word is true)
Jesus took 3 nails for me ( wheres my, wheres my, wheres my, graditude?)
Dont forsake the gathering (But when i come i come with an attitude)
How can you love someone you never seen (If you can't love someone in front of you)
Are you a saint?
Are you a ain't?
Some of yall got me so confused
I heard somebody say (just cuz i dont go to church that dont mean i ain't saved)
See you dont wanna join the family and learn the word so you can know how to behave
He said (i dont believe in that word it was written by a man and things have been changed)
Have you ever compared the originals to the same scriptures we read today?
He said (No) i dont think its fair for you to have that position without the facts
He said (dont push your religion on me)
I said dont push your religion on me right back
(well i dont trust in no Bible but i know that Jesus died for me)
Well my Jesus told me to tell u the church is 2 Timothy chapter 3 verse 16
So you say you christian i know imma christian but we dont have the same beliefs
I believe its the people like you that mess it up for the believers like me
Got emotional and said (man dont judge i was saved at a church in 93)
Well did the preacher preach outa the same word that u dont believe was it the same word that set you free (whoa!)

People put God in the back seat like a car seat
Show up at every party and church on time hardly
Im tryin to tell you that Christ is where my heart be
Im wit God for the long hall like an RV
I ain't conceided but i boast in God
Christians be up and down like rollercoaster rides
Do everyday based off emotions right
Yall funny all jokes aside (man)
And everybody act like they rather live in sin
But he died for us so we can live for him
Real saints in the church have become a minority
So what we need to do is make Christ a priority
You a saint or ain't a leader or a side kick
Jesus is the pilot and we should be in the cockpit
Riding shotgun wit Gods son
If we drive we gone wreck im talkin bout eternal death
