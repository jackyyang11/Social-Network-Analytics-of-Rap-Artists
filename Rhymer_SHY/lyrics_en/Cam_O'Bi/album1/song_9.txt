[Spoken into]
We'll do one last song for you guys, a cover
Please sing along I know you know this one

[Verse 1]
This hit, that ice cold
Michelle Pfeiffer, that white gold
This one, for them hood girls
Them good girls, straight masterpieces
Stylin', wilin'
Livin’ it up in the city
I Got Chucks on with Saint Laurent
Gotta kiss myself I’m so pretty

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m too hot (hot Cam)
Call the police and the fireman
I’m too hot (hot Cam)
Make a dragon wanna retire man
I’m too hot (hot Cam)
Say my name you know who I am
I’m too hot (hot Cam)
And my band 'bout that money
Break it down

[Chorus]
Boys hit your hallelujah (Woo!)
Boys hit your hallelujah (Woo!)
Boys hit your hallelujah (Woo!)
Cause Uptown funk gon’ give it to you
Cause Uptown funk gon’ give it to you
Cause Uptown funk gon’ give it to you
Saturday night and we in the spot
Don’t believe me, just watch (come on)
Don’t believe me, just watch
Don’t believe me, just watch
Don’t believe me, just watch
Don’t believe me, just watch
Don’t believe me, just watch
Hey, hey, hey, oh!

[Verse 2]
Stop
Wait a minute
Fill my cup put some liquor in it
Take a sip, sign the check
Julio! Get the stretch!
Ride to Harlem, Hollywood, Jackson, Mississippi
If we show up, we gon’ show out
Smoother than a fresh jar of Skippy

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I’m too hot (hot Cam)
Call the police and the fireman
I’m too hot (hot Cam)
Make a dragon wanna retire man
I’m too hot (hot Cam)
Yeah, say my name you know who I am!
I’m too hot (hot Cam)
And my band 'bout that money
Break it down

[Chorus]
Boys hit your hallelujah (Woo!)
Boys hit your hallelujah (Woo!)
Boys hit your hallelujah (Woo!)
Cause Uptown Funk gon’ give it to you
Cause Uptown Funk gon’ give it to you
Cause Uptown Funk gon’ give it to you
Saturday night and we in the spot
Don’t believe me, just watch (come on)
Don’t believe me, just watch
Don’t believe me, just watch
Don’t believe me, just watch
Don’t believe me, just watch
Don’t believe me, just watch
Hey, hey, hey, oh!

[Bridge]
Before we leave
Lemme tell y’all a lil’ something
I said Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up
Yeah, Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up
I said Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up
Yeah, Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up
Come on, dance
Jump on it
If you sexy then flaunt it
If you freaky then own it
Don’t brag about it, come show me
Come on, dance
Jump on it
If you sexy then own it
Well it’s Saturday night and we in the spot

[Part-Chorus]
Don’t believe me, just watch (come on)
Don’t believe me, just watch
Don’t believe me, just watch
Don’t believe me, just watch
Don’t believe me, just watch
Don’t believe me, just watch
Hey, hey, hey, oh!

[Outro]
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up (say whaa?!)
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up (break it down boy)
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up (say whaa?!)
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up
