No need to give a bunch of lame half ass excuses
Why this ain't love
I'm blonde but I ain't stupid
I was looking for a ring
It doesn't mean it doesn't sting when you cut and run so soon
Good luck so long
I guess I better get to leaving to
A half truth's still a lie
I need my space is still goodbye
Wrong size shoe could look good on you
But you'll be cussing your feet at midnight
A half cold beer ain't cold
I'll be back soon is still gone
A half smoked cigarette is still smoked
And a half broke heart's still broke
Na na na na
A half broke heart's still broke
Up front no strings
Sure fun till it unravels
Won't see me cry
But I might kind of want to call you tonight
Pour me a drink but don't make it to strong
Just need a little kicker to help me move on
Could say I don't care but just ok ain't all the way there
A half truth's still a lie
I need my space is still goodbye
Wrong size shoe could look good on you
But you'll be cussing your feet at midnight
A half cold beer ain't cold
I'll be back soon is still gone
A half smoked cigarette is still smoked
And a half broke heart's still broke
Na na na na
A half broke heart's still broke
Just because you don't call it love
Don't mean it don't mean a thing
I saw it coming and no hard feelings but it's hard feeling this way
A half truth's still a lie
I need my space is still goodbye
Wrong size shoe could look good on you
But you'll be cussing your feet at midnight
A half cold beer ain't cold
I'll be back soon is still gone
A half smoked cigarette is still smoked
And a half broke heart's still broke
A half smoked cigarette is still smoked
And a half broke heart's still broke
Na na na na
A half broke heart's still broke
Na na na na
A half broke heart's still broke
