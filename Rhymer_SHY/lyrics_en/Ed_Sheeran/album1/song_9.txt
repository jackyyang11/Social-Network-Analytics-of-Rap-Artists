[Intro]
One, two, three

[Verse 1]
And happy days
That left us on the floor
And you squeeze me
Till you're not feeling sure
Everything will brighten up
If we go to Brighton I'll take you along the pier
Everything will lighten up, and
If you feel too frightened I'll make things disappear
Dear

[Pre-Chorus]
Darling don't be nervous
I'll understand if you let me go
I did this on purpose
Now

[Chorus 1]
'Cause when I'm missing you
I'll stop eating food
And I'll squeeze into a dress
So I can be like you
And then I'll see your bitterness
And why you're leaving too
Maybe I'll put you to a test
And say that I love you
I think that I love you

[Verse 2]
Sunny days that left my skin blood red
And you breathe me
Till these thoughts leave my head
If it gets too complicated
I'll give up and be frustrated; can you see what's wrong?
If you feel like you've been jaded, and
This love's too overrated; see what's going on, on

[Pre-Chorus]
And darling don't be nervous
I'll understand if you let me go
I did this on purpose
Now

[Chorus 1]
'Cause when I'm missing you
I'll stop eating food
And I'll squeeze into a dress
So I can be like you
And then I'll see your bitterness
And why you're leaving too
Maybe I'll put you to a test
And say that I love you
I think that I love you

[Bridge]
Take me back to live at home
Take me back to Albert Road

[Chorus 2]
'Cause when I'm missing you
I'll stop eating food
And I'll squeeze into your dress
So I can feel like you
And then I'll see your bitterness
And why you left too
I thought I’d put you to a test
And say that I love you
I think that I love you
And I'll stop eating food
And I'll squeeze into your dress
So I can feel like you
And then I'll see your bitterness
And why you left me too
I thought I’d put you to a test
And say that I love you
Now it seems you loved me too
