[Verse 1]
I think I took too much
I'm addicted to your touch
But I'm crying
In shame again

[Hook 1]
And now I'm high as a kite
And I know I might be gone
When you get home

[Verse 2]
Oh well, we've come this far
You're my Venus
And I'm your Mars
And we've passed the moon and stars
And I'm gone

[Hook 2]
But now I'm high as a kite
And I know I might be gone
When you get home
I'm high as a kite
And I know I'm almost gone
When you get home

[Outro]
So please come home
