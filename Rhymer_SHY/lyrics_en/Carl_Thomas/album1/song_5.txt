LETS STEP

(verse 1)
I CANT EVEN PICTURE MYSELF
BEING WITH ANYONE BUT YOOOOU
I WOULD MUCH RATHER BE
ALL BY MYSELF
IF I COULDN’T BE WITH YOU
BECAUSE
YOU MAKE ME LAUGH (that’s not all)
WITH ALL THE JOKES YOU HAVE (that’s not all)
YOUR GHETTO AS YOU WANNA BE (that’s not all)
AND YOU’RE SO SEEEXXXXYYY (that’s not all)
OHHHHHH BAAABYYYY

(chorus)
There will never be (no there will never be no no no)
Another you (that’s whhhyyyy)
That’s why I feel (the way that I do)
The way I do about you (lets step)

(verse 2)
I’VE HAD OTHER GIRLS BEFORE YOU CAME
BUT IT WASN’T QUITE THE SAME
I WAS JUST USING THEM
THEN MOVING THEM AROUND
BUT I HAD TO LOCK YOU DOWN
CAUSE I CAN TALK TO YOU (that’s not all)
ABOUT ANYTHING (thats not all)
I CANT KEEP MY HANDS OFF OF YOU (that’s not all)
THERES SO MANY THINGS I CAN NAME
THE LIST GOES ON AND ONNNN

(chorus)
There will never be (no there will never never beee)
Another you (ohhh another another you)
That’s why I feel (ohhh that’s why)
The way I do about you

(bridge)
GIRLS LIKE YOU
ONLY COME AROUND
ONCE IN A LIFETIME
YOU’RE THE ONE (oh the one)
FOREVER MORE AND IM VERY SURE that there

(chorus)
There will never be
Another you (ohhh another another you baby)
That’s why I feel (ohhh that’s why that’s why I feel the way about you)
The way I do about you (lets step)
There will never be (neva neva neva neva be another you)
Another you (that can treat me the way that you dooo me)
That’s why I feel (that’s whhyyy I feeelll)
The way I do about you (that way about you)
There will never be
Another you
That’s why I feel
The way I do about you
