Oh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh yeah
Oh, yeah yeah

Anything
I am anything
I'm the one that you're perceiving in your heart
Anything
I am anything
If you think of me I'll be right where you are
Anything
I am anything
I'm the distance love can go that you don't do
Anything
I am anything
If you reach for me then I'll reach right for you
Anything
I am anything
I'm the darkness in the ocean, the sea blue
Anything
I am anything
