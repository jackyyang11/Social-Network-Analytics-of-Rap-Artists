Sometimes, it's the only thing we can do to move on. I know it's hard but you got to do it. The one thing I really deserve to know. Why?

Guess you know/That I came back to tell you/You got to go/And I said I'm tired of these lies/Hit the door/Cause everything that I been finding/Is telling me that you're not really respecting me

It's hard but this is what I gotta do/I never thought that I would say goodbye to you/I took all that I could, but now I'm through(but now I'm through)/So through with you(So through with you and all I wanna know girl is tell me)

Chorus 1x

Why, Why didn't I know/You confused me so/Maybe there was no one in love but me/How could this be/Not what I need/Cause there was no one else in love but me

It's personal/girl the way that you tried me/All I wanna know is/Did you think I would die/Oh, it hurt me so bad/But I got back up on my two feet/Just to stand my ground/Now it's coming back around

It's hard but this is what I gotta do(Gotta do)/I never thought that I would say goodbye to you(bye, bye, bye, bye)/I took all that I could, but now I'm through(but now I'm through)/So through with you(So through with you and all I wanna know baby)

Chorus 1x

Bridge

All the trust I had(Had)/Can't believe it's gone(Can't believe that it's gone)/Packing up your bags(Oh, packing your bags)/Leaving you alone(Leaving you alone)/Gonna find somebody new(Ohh)/Who treats me better than you(Better than you)/Appreciates what I do(Appreciates what I do for you,baby tell me)

Chorus 3x
