[Intro]
Tish
Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya

[Verse 1}
Cousin got locked up
Old friend got shot up
Older brothers on the run from the coppers
Best friend had a baby
Little sis second crazy
I just pray tonight that she gets home safely
Momma got bad health
Uncle killed himself
Whole world got problems
I can't even stop 'em no no no no
No no no no
And even if the sky is falling down

[Chorus]
I gotta keep on keepin' on
That's all that I can do, oh
I gotta keep on hustlin'
That's all that I can do, oh
And I wish that I could be there

[Verse 2]
Ki ki they lights out
Ta ta got kicked out
Lacy got beat down for having a big mouth
Mickey sellin crack
Po ain't comin' back
I just wish that night that he would have been strapped
Nieces and nephew ask them where they all at
Chasin' his dream and
I can't even stop him no no no no
No no no no
Yeah, cause even if the sky was fallin' down

[Chorus]
I gotta keep on keepin' on
That's all that I can do, oh
I gotta keep on hustlin'
That's all that I can do, oh
And I wish that I could be there, for you
Oh
You oh

I gotta keep on keepin' on
That's all that I can do, oh
I gotta keep on hustlin'
That's all that I can do, oh
And I wish that I could be there (for you)
Oh
You oh
