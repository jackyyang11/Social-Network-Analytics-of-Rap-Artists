[Intro]
I'm not gon' cry this time so it sounds better
There is life in New York
Underground in the coldest hearts
Lonely people are subway art

[Verse 1]
Lonely people cast away
For the crimes they committed
And the love ones they pain
Hope for redemption on a crowded train
Can you spare some change? Cause my baby need some diapers
I just got out of jail and nobody wants to hire
My mother just died and I have nowhere to go now
Got hurt on the job, got laid off and I'm broke now
I could be robbin' you but I'm tryna sell this candy
I need to feed my family, somebody help me

[Hook]
There is life in New York
Underground in the coldest hearts
Lonely people are subway art
Lonely people
In the coldest hearts

[Verse 2]
Lonely people whose broken dreams
Slowly became distant memories
Most of their prayers fall on dead ears in this crowded train
Hooked on drugs and I can't get sober
I'm only 18 and my whole life is over
I've done been to jail 5 times, give me a dollar
I'm just hungry, I'll take food if you got some
Anybody wanna buy my mix CD?
I need to feed my family, somebody help me

[Hook]
There is life in New York
Underground in the coldest hearts
Lonely people are subway art
Lonely people
In the coldest hearts
