[Chorus]
I don't wanna go home, go home for Christmas, oh no
Don't wanna go home, go home for Christmas, oh no
Spending the night with tears in my eyes
I don't wanna go home for Christmas

[Verse 1]
Cause I grew up in the Bronx where half of them niggas thought
I would never make it out, no way
And my mother still there and my folks still there
Still hustling to get their bills paid
When I see all of my cousins and best friends struggling
I feel some kind of way
And I ain't going back until that's something I can change

[Chorus]
I don't wanna go home, go home for Christmas, oh no
Don't wanna go home, go home for Christmas, oh no
Spending the night with tears in my eyes
I don't wanna go home for Christmas

[Verse 2]
Think 'cause I'm getting ahead, taking pictures with celebs now
That I'm making all this money, no way
Trying not to lose my mind, on the studio grind
Gotta make it to the top one day
Gonna take a little time but I'm never gonna quit
Cause I know they count on me
I can't let them down, it's too hard to face

[Chorus]
I don't wanna go home, go home for Christmas, oh no
Don't wanna go home, go home for Christmas, oh no
Spending the night with tears in my eyes
I don't wanna go home for Christmas

[Bridge]
I, I, I, I, I, I don't wanna go
My heart, my pride can't take another blow
Spending the night with tears in my eyes
I don't wanna go home for Christmas

[Chorus]
I don't wanna go home, go home for Christmas, oh no
Don't wanna go home, go home for Christmas, oh no
Spending the night with tears in my eyes
I don't wanna go home for Christmas

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't wanna go home for Christmas
