Ice cold, Solid gold

Boom, bye, bye

Feeling so good, oh man

Out in the rain, rain, rain

[Pre: Chorus]
Cause' I've been feelin' myself
When I'm feelin' myself
If you feelin' your self
Then we're feelin' ourselves
Hands in the air
Bottles drinks everywhere
For my homies not here
For my homies in jail
Homies in jail
Homies in jail
Put your drinks up for my homies in jail
Happy belated if two days your birthday
Cause nigga I'm living next year, yeah!
