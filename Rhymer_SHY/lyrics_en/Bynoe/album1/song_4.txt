[Intro]

I woke up screaming fuck the world!
All eyes on me
I woke up screaming fuck the world
They find pies on me
Bandana!
Fuck the world
Yeah hahaha what you say beano

[Hook]

All I really wanted was a new Glock, got me feeling like 2Pac (x2)

When we ride on our enemies
Got me feeling like 2Pac (x2)

Bandana

I woke up screaming fuck the world (x2)


[Verse 1]

Bandana on my head with my tattoo's got a screw missing boy I'm nutter than a cashew

Pistol on my lap got the chopper in the trunk
I got 30 in this bitch I'll give you what u want

I got murder on my mind since they killed
Stack and Chinx, bulletproof everything boy I'm riding in the brinks

Catch a fuck boy slipping hit his ass at the light

Shell cases everywhere bullets hit him night night

Chopper, chopper break his ass off proper
No beam jawn

It's war time when I'm aiming at your bean boy

Feeling like PAC when he first came "All Eyez On Me" imma ride till they gone


[Hook]

All I really wanted was a new Glock, got me feeling like 2Pac (x2)

When we ride on our enemies
Got me feeling like 2Pac (x2)

Bandana

I woke up screaming fuck the world (x2)

[Verse 2]
Still moving with the clipper on me I'll give it to your bigger homie

Old man Quiles got it like Radames, Riverside motherfucker got a lot bread

Mix the Zè with the Henny I got thug life tatted

Homie doing 20 years cause them sucker niggas ratted

Picture me rolling I got my Glock cocked drop top AC

California dreaming why fuck niggas hate me?

Hail Mary what do we have here now do you wanna ride or die?

Da- da- da- da- da- da- da- (2Pac)

[Verse 3]

The number #1 question is I'm still cool with homie

I'm on my Treach shit I do my dirt all by my lonely

Friends killing friends see what Bishop did to Rah I don't trust near nigga I'll let a couple of them fly

Razor blade in my mouth like Birdie on the sideline no if ands or buts motherfucker know I'm bout mines

Suge got grazed, PAC hit four times gotta keep your eyes open cause they hate to see you shine

Lucky me all I wanted was the justice, immortal outlaw still riding on you suckers

It's M.O.B so believe me we enemies, against all odds

[Hook]
