[Pre Chorus]

They wanna know when the pain gone stop no brighter days when the rain gone stop
Paranoid with my brain on shot Ridin' round with that thing on cock (Who do you love?)
Back against the wall head up nigga
Rather die a man than live a fuck nigga
It’s Gang to the death never switch if I'm the last one left
Have the Mac sing a lullaby middle finger to the other side
10 toes down in this bitch, stand up I ain't never gone sit

[Chorus]

Running laps on these niggas like Jackie Joyner
7 days a week i came from the corner
Hustle hard nigga hustle hard, it’s either that or you can find God



[Verse 1]

Pistol on my belt nozzle in the loop
I'm from the projects we was trained to shoot
Guerrilla Warfare, gladiator stepping over piss in the elevator
In the game I'm like one more flip
Test my aim in the range I'm like one more clip
Shakers in my palm i got the bank stopped
40 poking out the tank top
Bare arms like N.R.A. apply pressure to these fools that they send our way
Wax on, wax off like Daniel son
Miagi on these niggas i don't plan to run
Niggas ain't been through shit but a hard break up
In the kitchen with pot watch the hard break up
Hit it with the fork i ain't lose a gram
Lagassi on these niggas with the pots and pans


[Chrorus]

Running laps on these niggas like Jackie Joyner
7 days a week i came from the corner
Hustle hard nigga hustle hard, it's either that or you can find God


[Verse 2]
I got a head full of evil thoughts am i satan
I been coulda killed these niggas I’m still waiting
In the Telly with two whores
Benz with two doors
31 shots in the 4 (Oh Lord)
That pain don’t stop when that clipper get to ripping bet the pain won't stop (Rhaaaa)
Put a bag on your head like suffocation
Green light em’ anywhere ain't a hesitation
If everybody real where the pussies at?
Whole lot of milk where the cookies at?
Niggas been ratting who your big homies?
Niggas hate to see you winning but your bitch is on me
This is cloth talk the shit Jesus wore
Valentino Rock Runners I'm a sneaker whore
Your fabric of a bitch
Got so many blue faces niggas thinking I'm Crip (Caaaa Rip)
A hundred after hundred you can’t find a 20
Fuck a rubber band zip tie the money
Blood on it from the paper cuts
If you know what's in the bank you ain't make enough


[Chrorus] 2x

Running laps on these niggas like Jackie Joyner
7 days a week i came from the corner
Hustle hard nigga hustle hard, it's either that or you can Find God
