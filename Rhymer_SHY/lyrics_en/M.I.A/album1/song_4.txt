[Verse 1]
Said you're all mouth and no brains, all rockstars go to heaven
You said you’ll be dead at 27, when we drunk in a English tavern
The owner poured you the Bourbon, and you drunk yourself so rotten
He got so rich he bought a Bentley, and moved himself to Devon

[Verse 2]
You started dirty dancing, and you bartended a dozen
I took you to the clinic, to get you clean but you couldn’t
Said in 2 days you're 27, and and your destiny was comin'
And your papa passed so sudden, and left you with a little somethin'

[Verse 3]
You blew that money on a mountain of drugs, and staged your self a bed in
A month later when I popped in, you're still high but the winter set in
I bought you a coffee and a muffin, and you quoted me some Lenin
I wished I was that clever, but that's what kept me coming
Your friendship did mean somethin', but you left me for nothin'
When I left, you befriended a rope, and I found you both were hanging
