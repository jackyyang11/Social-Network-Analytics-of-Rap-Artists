[Verse 1]
Baby, it's hard to find
A dude that can get the better out of me-e
And Baby I like your steed
I think you got exactly what I need

Ooh, ooh-oo-ooh
Can you make a woman out of me-e?
Ooh, ooh-oo-ooh
Can you make a woman out of me-e?

[Verse 2]
Baby, you're not it seems
You need to take me more seriously
And baby, I hope I'm not to deep
We can try to keep it short and sweet

[Pre-Hook]
Ooh, ooh-oo-ooh
Can you make a woman out of me-e?
Ooh, ooh-oo-ooh
Can you make a woman out of me-e?

Baby step back, check on this, don't be shy just holla
Want me you in this club, don't make me pull your collar
Baby step back, check on this, don't be shy just holla
