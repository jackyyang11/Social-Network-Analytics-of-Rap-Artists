[Verse 1]
You can take me to the court room, you can take me to the jail
You can take me anywhere, but you can’t do me there
You can take me to the court room, you can take me to the jail
You can take me anywhere, but you can’t do me there

[Verse 2]
I hate to do what I did ‘cause I had to do it
What they did it’s hit the truth, but I can see it through it
I don’t like it when people say, "Hello girl, what’s up?"
Age, taxes, and cost of livin’, teah boy ain’t that good enough?
