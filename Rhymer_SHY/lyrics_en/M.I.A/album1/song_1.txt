Chinna Girl is a little girl
From a town
That's all ya need to know

Lolita was a man-eater
Clocked him like a taxi meter
Fuck gold, she was platinum digger
Shakin-ass-making moves on a mover
Visa, then a plane ride to ya
Peace out, she'll kill you like Uma

She skipped away to the shop
She found she didn't have enough
She clocked him looking right at her
And sucked on a lollipop

[Hook]

Chinna Girl grew up to be a big girl
Had her sights set on a bigger world
Dial-a-Bride from Sri lanka
Found herself a Yorkshire banker

Need a Visa?
Got with a geezer
Need some money?
Paid him with a knees-up
Year later, started to ease-up
Got her own way, shouted out "see ya"

She skipped away to the shop
She found she didn't have enough
She clocked him looking right at her
And sucked on a lollipop

What can I get fo' 10 dollar?
Everything you want
And what can I get fo' 10 dollar?
Anything you want
Yeah what can I get fo' 10 dollar?
