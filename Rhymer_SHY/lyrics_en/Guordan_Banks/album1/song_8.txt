[Verse 1]
Baby don't sell me out no no no
Maybe we should just talk about what went wrong
I don't why the hell were you trying to hurt me

[Bridge]
Remember all of the times that you said you loved me
Now I'm no longer there you're not thinking of me
How can something so lovely turn out so ugly

[Hook](x2)
It's enough pain, it's enough pain, it's enough pain that I don't have you by my side
So you ain't got to do no more than that
And you ain't got to talk no more than that

[Verse 2]
How could you just go around and tarnish my name
You gave me your word in my living room that I wouldn't have to worry about a thing
You can't feel comfortable about that

[Bridge]

[Hook](x2)

[Verse 3]
I thank you for these songs
Girl life was going wrong
I endured a lot of pain
But there's joy after the rain
Now you standing outside
And since you missed your ride
You used an inside job
But that shit didn't even fly
Once you high
No one relevant will get to hear your side
But out of seven billion people in the world
I would never expect you to try to take my shine
It's enough pain, it's enough pain, it's enough pain
