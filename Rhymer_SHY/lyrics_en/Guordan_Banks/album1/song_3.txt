[Verse 1]:
Lately you been running these lonely streets too much
Watching you catch the bus, saying nobody picking you up
Your smile is too pretty, that ass is too fat for you to ever do that
You're meant to ever be do, for you to ever need shoes
For you to ever have to lose

[Chorus]:
Let me know when you're ready to crossover
Let me know when you're ready to get put on
Let me know when you're ready to crossover
Let me know when you're ready to get put on
I'll put you on 'cause I'll put that ass on real good
I'll put you on, I'll put you on
I'll put you on, I'll put you on, yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 2]:
You sleeping, you sleeping, don't you wake up 'cause a nigga no good
He sacrificed a 10, when you gonna leave that nigga in the hood?
Rumor has it, you a squirter, broke niggas don't deserve ya
Got you out there flipping burgers, let a young brother serve ya
I know you want that, you want that, you do
'Cause all I want that, I want that is you

[Chorus]:
Let me know when you're ready to crossover
Let me know when you're ready to get put on
Let me know when you're ready to crossover
Let me know when you're ready to get put on
I'll put you on 'cause I'll put that ass on real good
I'll put you on, I'll put you on
I'll put you on, I'll put you on, yeah yeah yeah

[Bridge]:
If you ready (I'll put you on)
I will, I will put you on (I'll put you on)
(?) those games, are you ready to change baby? (I'll put you on)
I will put, put you on (I'll put you on, I'll put you on)
If you ready to crossover, babe, are you ready to crossover, babe?
(I'll put you on, I'll put you on)

[Chorus]:
Let me know when you're ready to crossover
Let me know when you're ready to get put on
Let me know when you're ready to crossover
Let me know when you're ready to get put on
I'll put you on 'cause I'll put that ass on real good
I'll put you on, I'll put you on
I'll put you on, I'll put you on, yeah yeah yeah
