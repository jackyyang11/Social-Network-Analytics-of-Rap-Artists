[Intro]
Aye y'all it's your boy Guordan Banks
I just wanted to thank you all for downloading my EP A Song For Everyone
I want to take the time out right now to dedicate this whole EP to a good friend of mine and a good brother
His name is Jimme Wallstreet he inspired me
He's the reason I'm even pushing this hard and going this hard to make it to the top
So this song right here Jimme I know we love this song but we gon' share it with the word
And hopefully you guys blast this song and keep blasting it
Jimme Wallstreet!

[Bridge: Guordan Banks]
I don't want no other man to fill my shoes
I don't want no other man to fill my shoes
I don't want no other man to fill my shoes

[Verse 1: Jimme Wallstreet]
I remember when I met you
Took me a month to call [?] to treat it special
Ya head look like Indians [?]
Minus the head you had me twisted like a pretzel
On another level you the bass I'm the treble
I'm the dirt you the shovel
And I don't like the [?]
My momma tried to tell me not to trust you
Looking at her like she jealous of you
Even Stevie Wonder can see that I love you
Would've took a bullet for you, pulled the trigger for you
How I adore you
Tables turned and then you turned unloyal
Came with a heart that's pure, unspoiled
Therefore it's so pure
Put your glasses on tell me what your looking for

[Hook: Guordan Banks]
I'd do what nobody else to love you
I'd do what nobody else to love you
You've been good to me
I've been treating your right
I've been treating your bad
This time, this time
I'm going to change my ways

[Verse 2: Jimme Wallstreet]
I had it all figured out
Kids in Disneyworld balling out
Bar-b-ques at big momma's house
You was looking like love I was looking like I'm out
I meant I could've worn my welcome out
In and out, trips down south
I could've went the other route
But I didn't so know [?] out
Map out [?] zero
You starting looking at my like a superhero
Lipstick on my collar acting like you don't see it
I had your heart but I didn't know how to treat it
No Mike Jackson I told you to beat it
Shawty in your ear like a q-tip, leave 'em
I thought I'd never see you leaving
On that day you left we broke even

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jimme Wallstreet]
So enclosed in after proposing
Ice box in my chest my heart is frozen
Thought it would end with wedding pictures and posing
Instead I'm here with my heart wide open
As I look back dealing with the fact
Knowing deep inside that I'd never get you back
Cause that I had to [?] back
But I couldn't tear it up cause your name was on that
I'm on track even though you got married on me
Keith Sweat, make it last forever mami
I know how you get down I used to live with you
You gon' get it, I used to give it to you
I ain't know how your end go
Got you fine carrots had you looking like a rainbow
Typical go around like marry go
You grabbed his hand when you let mine go

[Hook]

[Bridge: Guordan Banks]

[Outro: Jimme Wallstreet]
Let bygones be bygones
Bye I'm gone
Farewell, farewell, farewell
Aye London, Count, [?] studios
Wallstreet
It's a hit, hit it
Let it ride out
