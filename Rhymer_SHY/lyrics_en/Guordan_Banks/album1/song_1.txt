[Intro: Oprah]
You will be the last person today to get one of those cut little G6s
Ok, who will it be
Are your ready, Q the drum roll
Alright open your boxes 1,2,3
You get a car, you get a car, you get a car, you get a car

[Hook: Guordan Banks](x4)
You get a car, you get a car, you get a car, you get a car
All my girls get cars, all my girls get cars

[Verse: Guordan Banks & (Ayo)]
What a lucky girl you are
All my girls, all my girls, all my girls get cars

(Never worry, Mercedes
I ain't talking about no cheap car baby
All get cars)

Yes they do, yes they do, yes they do

(All my girls get cars)
