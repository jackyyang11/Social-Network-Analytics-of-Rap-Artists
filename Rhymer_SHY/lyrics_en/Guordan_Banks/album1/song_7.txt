[Verse 1]
Night after night, day after day
How do you do it? Make it look easy
Did all my best, show you how to make it
A man feel real good, how to get yo' way
Cause that's what I want to do
Give it to you
Anything you want, Yves St Laurent
All the fancy things cars and airplanes
Trips to Spain

[Bridge 1]
Girl you make me ignore
All the Rihannas, all the Tiannas, all the Ciaras
All of the other girls

[Bridge 2]
Oh you are you are you are you are
You are you are you are you are
You are, you are, you are

[Hook]
You're so good, you're so good
You're so good, you're so good
So good at what you do
So good at what you do

[Verse 2]
Glad you came through, somewhere out of town
You can't be from this world Pluto, Mars
That must be you, you know how to shine
You turn it up and don't have to try
That's why I like you by my side
Pull out that car, everything I buy
But you don't have a tag, no price on you
And none of these girls ain't got a damn thing on you

[Bridge 1]

[Hook] (x2)

[Interlude]
You that work, you that work, you that work
How does it work, how does it work
Who do you think you are?
Who, who, who
Who do you think you are?
Who, who, who
