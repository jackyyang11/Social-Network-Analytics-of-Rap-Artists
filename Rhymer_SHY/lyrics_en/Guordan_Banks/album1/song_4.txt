[Verse 1: Guordon Banks]
Dear friend, I hope everything's going alright with you
I know I thought I'd be spending my life with you
I know we said it'd never be the end yeah
Run tell your family I didn't do right by you
But I can't continue living a lie with you
Something I got to do (yeah)
I know its hard to finally say goodbye (oh why, I)
I hope to see you on the other side
We tried, we tried, we tried

[Hook: Guordon Banks]
All those times I tried for you
Thought that we would make it through
Sacrificed my life for you
Look at what it had to come to (come to, oh)
Had it all, had it all
We could have had it
We could have had it
We could have had it all

[Verse 2: Sonyaè Elise]
Dear friend, always saw you in a picture now its fuck the frame
Always thought that we'd be winning now its fuck the game
Everybody go through things, I thought we needed space
Type of love we got can't nobody come take your place
I've been meaning to pick up a phone just to tell you
Baby I still love you and I know you better
For some reason I'm done, took our separate ways
And if you ever need it, I'm good for it babe
All that up and down and back and forth we went through
Just to get it right for the day
All the years of trying, bitches calling, babies crying
Check and get it off your chest

[Hook: Guordon Banks & Sonyaè Elise]
All those times I tried for you
Thought that we would make it through
Sacrificed my life for you
Look at what it had to come to (come to)
Had it all, had it all
We could have had it
We could have had it
We could have had it all
Had it all, had it all
We could have had it
We could have had it
We could have had it all

[Sonyaè Elise]
Dear Friend
