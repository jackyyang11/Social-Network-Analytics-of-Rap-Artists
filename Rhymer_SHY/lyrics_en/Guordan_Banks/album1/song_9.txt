[Verse 1]
I see you around, but now I think its time to take some time off
Oh baby that made you smile now
I know that you been running for a while now

[Bridge]
Don't run I got so much for you
I know you feel the love is in the air
Don't move you got a lot to lose
And if you walk away it won't be fair no no

[Chorus]
Can I keep you in mind
Can I can I
Can I keep you in mind
In my mind

[Verse 2]
When I wake up I'm incomplete cause you ain't where I lay love
Baby I see you, you nervous
Just let me in I promise to be worth it

[Bridge]
Don't run I got so much for you
I know you feel the love is in the air
Don't move you got a lot to lose
And if you walk away it won't be fair no no

[Chorus]
Can I keep you in mind
Can I can I
Can I keep you in mind
In my mind
Can I keep you in mind
Can I can I
Can I keep you in mind
In my mind
Can I keep you in mind
Can I can I
Can I keep you in mind
In my mind
Can I keep you in mind
Can I can I
Can I keep you in mind
In my mind
