[Intro: Guordan Banks]
I still feel the way
I still feel the way, feel the way, feel the way
I still feel the way
I still feel the way, feel the way, feel the way

[Verse 1: Guordan Banks]
Yes, it's true
That I still fuck with you
The shit that we've been through
That no one else been through
I...
You could be my queen and I'm your king
Want you to be the reason why I sing
It hasn't been easy as it was, dear
Wanna give you my all (I, oh)

[Chorus: Guordan Banks]
I still feel the way
I still feel the way, feel the way, feel the way
I still feel the way (feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it)
I still feel the way, feel the way, feel the way
I still feel the way (feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it)
I still feel the way, feel the way, feel the way
I still feel the way (feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it)
I still feel the way, feel the way, feel the way

[Verse 2: Tdot Illdude]
Still feel the way you slept on me
Still feel the way you stepped on me
I remember the crumbs that you left for me
I remember the ones who is dead for me
I still feel the way, feel the way
I wanna kill some days
I still kneel and pray, I still kneel and pray
Still feel the way, it's fuel to me
I still feel the way, it's the fuel to me
Showin' love vs. cruelty
I still feel the way

[Chorus: Guordan Banks]
I still feel the way
I still feel the way, feel the way, feel the way
I still feel the way (feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it)
I still feel the way, feel the way, feel the way
I still feel the way (feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it)
I still feel the way, feel the way, feel the way
I still feel the way (feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it)
I still feel the way, feel the way, feel the way

[Verse 3: Guordan Banks]
Girl, do I look like I'm Pinocchio?
I ain't lyin', that's just how it goes
Tryna find my mind like the scarecrow (scarecrow)
Somewhere over the rainbow (rainbow)
And, I...
I can't eat
I can't sleep
And I can't breathe again, breathe again, breathe (ooh)

[Chorus: Guordan Banks]
I still feel the way (still feel the way)
I still feel the way, feel the way, feel the way
I still feel the way (still feel the way)
I still feel the way, feel the way, feel the way (ooh)
I still feel the way (feel the way)
I still feel the way, feel the way, feel the way
I still feel the way (ooh)
I still feel the way, feel the way, feel the way (feel the way, feel, feel the way)
