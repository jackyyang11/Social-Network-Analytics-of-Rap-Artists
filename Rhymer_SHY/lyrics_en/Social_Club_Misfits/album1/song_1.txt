[Intro]
Tell your mom to buy Misfits 2 Yeah
What else is there to say?
Except for a couple more things
It’s Social Club baby

[Verse 1: Martymar]
The game done changed since we last dropped
Number three on Billboard, recorded off my laptop
The last three girls didn’t work out on some bad luck
Five CDs, 80 tracks later better catch up
And if you see where I should be, it doesn’t add up
All grace everything and Social Club’s the mascot
It feels good to live your dreams when they were doubting you
When you say hello to them, it makes ‘em change they attitude
For everybody talking I ain’t mad at you
I promise God can use us both, but don’t make him embarrass you
That’s just how it goes, living in better clothes
And every holiday I see a text you better show
I been traveling but I said I’ll be coming home
They say “Marty you ain’t good enough”
I guess now we know
Been in the sky so much my ears don’t even pop
No more features for rappers unless we’re getting cuts
No cuts on splits I’m on my producer tip
Love God and love people, I promise to never switch

[Hook]
Viva La Misfit Gang, Misfit Gang, Misfit Gang
Viva La Misfit Gang, Misfit Gang
Viva La Misfit Gang
MIA to NY, MIA to NY, MIA to NY
LA when we get by(X2)

[FERN]
With this pen in my hand dawg, I’m Joe Pesci
Bold with my words stand firm, brothers don’t test me
They still talking about my talent show in high school
Flowed on ‘em seven minutes straight, told ‘em flight school
I hit Florida one year after Jordan emerged
The greatest I’ve ever seen, and me not so bad with the words
I haven’t written a sixteen without mentioning God (haven't)
I don’t know what ya’ll mean when ya’ll sending them shots
Cammie told me that Santino gon' rap too
Straight to the league, next LeBron outta high school
We make the music for them kids on the city bus
Latch key baby’s parents come from the 80’s, bruh
From MIA (MIA), down to LAX (LAX)
Truthfully we the only ones who can say we next
Cause we’re independent (yes), talking technically (technically)
But solely rely on God when we’re ministry-ing
Fernie
