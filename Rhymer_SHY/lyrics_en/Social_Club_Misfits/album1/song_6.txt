[Verse 1: Fern]
Yeah, my daughter's turning 5, I'm feeling the pressure
My jet black hair turning white, I can't tell you what's better
I realise you spend way more time old than young
Pardon to those who live friendly but have more to come
Social network's not the one to really get involved
I lived in a time where there were no cameras at alls
On my patio, thinking it was so simple and
We overcomplicated things and passed it to our kids
Yeah, the fact I'm slept on is mind-boggling
I recollect all the times I call it mind-jocking
I wrote the top 10 in the fourth quarter
Order physicals for family, just a small order
I'm the type to make records on the [?]
I told them never forget the Social Club is the best
And we could talk about it forever I promise
'Cause the floor sit you down like we having some coffee
Uh, more bookings, more floor space
I'm tryna get at the doorman in the door way
I put my son to sleep at night, I feel so accomplished
Same time feeling humble 'cause it was a promise
Uh, put my son to sleep at night I feel accomplished
Same time feeling so humble 'cause it was a promise
Thank you Lord

[Hook: Fern]
If I could sing a song for Cami, her little brother or mommy
Whenever I'm not around they don't have to worry about me
Come on, yeah, come on
If I could write a song for Cami, her little brother or mommy
Whenever I'm not around they don't have to worry about me

[Verse 2: Fern]
I remember the day like it was yesterday
Camilla Bella, my princess and as forever I love her is what I tell her
Choked on tears, falling early in the verse
She knows Daddy's away but I made time for her
Uh, that's wife plus little man
This just the first half of some bigger plans
Uh, ridiculous how the Lord so clear
So I never questioned why he positioned me here
I stand bold no pressure, been testing
Came out of it unscathed, my father has resurrected
The words I'm putting together is what you have to remember me
Cami is 18 I'll remind me I have a legacy
Yeah, and Larissa remains next to me
Uh, although the future remains to be seen
But imma keep moving like always
As my youngest days little Ferny in the hallway
Hollywood, Mount Sidney and the Florida is my state
Pardon my face, sorry for the crime rate
Momma ain't raised no fool, so I ain't raising
Why don't y'all start making money and stop raising funds
Cause all that "GoFundme" is just a bit much
Told my daughter hard work, always a way to stay up

[Hook: Fern]
If I could sing a song for Cami, her little brother or mommy
Whenever I'm not around they don't have to worry about me
Come on
If I could sing a song for Cami, her little brother or mommy
Whenever I'm not around they don't have to worry about me
