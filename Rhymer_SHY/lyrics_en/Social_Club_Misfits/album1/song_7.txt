[Intro: Martymar]
Known to wild out on my intros
No car, pickin' girls up in the rental
Flippin' tables like Jesus in the temple
No liquor, order me a Shirley Temple

[Verse 1: Martymar]
Wearing red shoes, they not Yeezys
Come through with the matchin' outfit like the Bee Gees
I came from preacher by Wigley in '09
To every show, sellin' out CDs
They keep tellin' me life is not easy
But Imma change the world until they finally believe me
So put your hands together like a ouija board
For the unsigned hyper, no source
Top floor at the Filmore watchin' Andy Mineo
Couple months later I was dancin' in the video
We were wildin' out with Pablo on the miniboat
Hopped out, I did a perfect somersault in the ocean
Only word of mouth, no promotion
Just a bunch of misfits with love and devotion
And my gang is lookin' focused
That's why we lift our glasses to the sky where our hope is

[Hook 1]
Ladies and gentleman
The moment you've all been waiting for
Coming to the stage, the Misfits
All been waiting
Coming to the stage, the Misfits
Social, stage
The Misfits

[Verse 2: F.E.R.N]
I look at the game and I laugh at it
Oh, you rap? Here's a deal
Take a stab at it, now there's a bad habit
It's common sense, only the hot should rap
Now everybody and they mother wanna pop they raps
C'mon dawg, I work the 9 to 5
You gettin' high, wastin' time in the studio, why?
Shawty, read the dotted the line
You shouldn't rap if you're wack
Just cause you have a Cadillac, sell crack
Doesn't mean you melt tracks
Take yourself back, where you came from
Your lame slums
Your rhymes are weak, go exercise your brain some
You can't ride with the big dog, big dog
I flip rhymes, Fern rock, get the Flex bomb
It's real nice, spit fire, livin' real nice
Big contracts, cars, your real ice
But when the dough go, car crash, ice melts
I remain hot, Fern can't be stopped
Ya cats rappin' ain't sayin' nothin'
Keepin' it so real, and tell 'em, "All you frontin"
Like you John Blaze or something
I come through, both orange b truck
And that was way before rap, same time as Baby GAP
Baby, holla at me

[Hook 2]
Ladies and gentleman
The moment you've all been waiting for
Coming to the stage, the Misfits
Straight out of the dungeons of rap
Coming to the stage, the Misfits
Social, stage
Social Club
Heralding from the, South Florida
The most incredible
