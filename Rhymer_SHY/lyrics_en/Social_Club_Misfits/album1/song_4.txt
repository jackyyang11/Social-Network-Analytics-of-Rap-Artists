[Intro: Abiv]
You sent me a request and I accepted
But I didn't know you at all
You started liking pictures from way back when
My homies considered you a stalker
But I told them at least I think she's cute
Likes turned to comments and I saw you while in school

[Hook: Abiv]
Well isn't it awkward
That we see each other everyday but we don't speak at all
Well isn't it awkward
That we're close on the internet, but real life we're so far
Hey stranger don't I look familiar to you
Hey stranger, hey stranger don't I look familiar to you
Or will keep doing that awkward thing you do

[Verse 1: Marty]
Hi you looking at me?
Ok no you're looking at them
Now I wasn't talking to you guys, um I was talking to them uh
I think everything about you is magical and I just love your face
That was kind of weird to say its not like I think about you everyday
Ok maybe half the day
You sit in math class right next to me
And if you need notes just ask for me
And we can get lost like Cast Away
Like Cast Away it's a movie from like back in the day with Tom Hanks and stuff
And I'm just uh, kinda stupid I just had to say

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Marty]
One time for the good guys who said, "I love you"
And she said, "Hello"
And two times for the couples who love each other and won't let go
I wanna be like that
I want a family, I want a dog or cat
I wanna work it out when we both get mad
I won't make you sad, I wanna make you mad
I wanna feel like we got it together, knowing that I will be staying with you
And every time that I see your picture I want to be here with you, uh
Yea you're my dream come true girl, I think about you all the time
Maybe I can make you laugh and one day maybe you'll be mine
