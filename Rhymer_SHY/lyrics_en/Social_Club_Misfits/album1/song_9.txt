[Hook: Cris Cab]
Someone took my eyes now I would lose my way
Stumble through the darkness to live another day
If only they could hear me I'd have some words to say
I'd tell them all to go out, stop this game to play

[Verse 2: Martymar]
I told my gang of misfits we gon' make it 'til the end
And it's inevidible, I know I was born to win
Never blame the devil on any misfortune
Left everything behind now I'm going all in
They told me everything is gon' change
My best days were behind me and I'm going down the wrong way
I connect with the world through my pain
I've got the grace of His love in my veins
I got a killer team
Triple beams, nothing's what it seems
Everybody trippin' off of what it means
To be a Social Club Misfit
I will always be me and never try to fit in
Yeah, this is music for the rest of us
Social Club kids, you should invest in us
Never trust anybody who thinks less of us
Now I wish all my haters the best of luck, luck

[Hook]

[Bridge: Cris Cab]
Told me that I'd never be found
Nervous when I come around
And I know because I'm standing my ground
So I told them that I'd never fall down
We don't need your hatred, we only have one life
We don't need your progress, we see a different light
We only want our voices to let the truth be known
Cause when the world is silent our brilliance will be shown

[Verse 4: F.E.R.N]
They say life's for the favor, huh?
The difference is I take mines and put it on paper, outrageous, uh
My goal, spread the message on stages
Of the one who died so that I could stand blameless
Shameless, put me on top of the A-List
Hey kids, put Social Club on your playlist
No days off, I'm workin' right through your day shift
Keep it simple, Social, I'm taking 'em to the basics
It's dedication to live and be willing to die
Over people who in turn would spit in your eye
You really love with the love we could only imagine
So I treat our sacred bond like my only ration
My family's like an open wound
For the living Christ who rose up and left an open tomb
My mixtapes are promotionals
But my debut album will be my devotional
