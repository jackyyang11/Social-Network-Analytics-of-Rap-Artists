[2Pac]
Yes I am gonna say that I'm a thug
That's because I came from the gutter and I'm still here

[Hook]
Everybody go & put your hands up high
Put your hands up high
Put your hands up high
Gang signs up in the sky
Gang signs up in the sky
Everybody go & put your hands up high
Put your hands up high
Put your hands up high
Gang signs up in the sky
Gang signs up in the sky

[Verse 1]
E's up, yup better get it right
Higher than the fever that you get when you get a bite
My life's on the edge, like the line on your forehead
Give a fuck I'll use a butter knife to get more bread
Time's up, time's rough, but I couldn't get enough
See what flashes your eyes boy when you're getting stuck
Who's what? whose who?, who's there? who's not?
You will find out who is real when you get caught
Play smart, have heart, be about your money
Keep it gutter muthafucker and keep it 1 hundred
Real recognize real, fuck how you get meals
If this 9 to 5 don't work then it's back to drug deal
Gotta get the cheddar, gotta get the cheddar
Gotta get the cash uhh, even if it's illegal
Knock on the door got me starrin' at my peak hole
They can try and find it, it's stashed up my cheeks though

[Hook]
Everybody go & put your hands up high
Put your hands up high
Put your hands up high
Gang signs up in the sky
Gang signs up in the sky
Everybody go & put your hands up high
Put your hands up high
Put your hands up high
Gang signs up in the sky
Gang signs up in the sky

[Verse 2]
Back up, far, cause it gets worse
Every single rider gonna feel me by the next verse
Been cursed, done dirt, boy had to earn stripes
Kinda like a pilot cause I always had to take flight
Gang fight, late nights, yeah I was in 'em
Head up chest out like a cobra with some venom
Deadly get me, never been afraid of death
All up in the mix like a dick, till my last breath
Gang signs up, what? go ahead & represent
If you're from a hood better flash your muthafucking set
Tatted up head, tatted up chest, tatted up legs G
I'm tatted up everywhere, hand grippin'
Walking with no shirt like I fucking care
Let 'em stare, just don't stare long or just be aware
Playing fair, if you don't it's all good I got a pair
Meanwhile on the side with a 9 hoping that you dare

[Hook]
Everybody go & put your hands up high
Put your hands up high
Put your hands up high
Gang signs up in the sky
Gang signs up in the sky
Everybody go & put your hands up high
Put your hands up high
Put your hands up high
Gang signs up in the sky
Gang signs up in the sky

[Verse 3]
Last one, ready? then here it comes
Signs like a bum cause I always had to get me some
That with drugs, just saw my kids, aye what you need?
Had it raw or I had it fresh baked
I'm a hustler, everything I touch gotta double up
Everything I grab I had double up, a pair of tits & a big 'ol butt
And she does what I say, yeah baby girl knows whats up
So rough so tough its the way we living
Everybody lookin' at me like what's he dealing?
No squealing, who's fiending? dog I got you G
Next time you pay double so you know it ain't free
Bling bling, dope fiends bring that jewelry too
I don't need to wear none, still fucked her & her crew
What it do? if you knew you would act the same
But since you don't, here's a flash just remember my gang

[Hook]
Everybody go & put your hands up high
Put your hands up high
Put your hands up high
Gang signs up in the sky
Gang signs up in the sky
Everybody go & put your hands up high
Put your hands up high
Put your hands up high
Gang signs up in the sky
Gang signs up in the sky
