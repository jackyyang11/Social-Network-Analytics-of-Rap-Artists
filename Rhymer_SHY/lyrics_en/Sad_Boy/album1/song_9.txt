[Verse 1]
Now this here is for those who drop tears
To all those that cried cause their boys are not here
Women or children don't matter the case
But whole bottom line is we're killing our race
Life is too easy, it's the choices that you make
But no guarantee that you'll live through the day
You don't have to gang bang just to live in danger
Don't you see it in the news?
You'll get strangled by strangers
Every fool with a gun wanna shoot up a place
Killing innocent, just to see the news & their face
Had a rough childhood but can't blame it on others
Most hustle, just to help out their mothers
Some struggle, 9 to 5 ain't meant for everyone
But for me, I just got employer of the month
I'm a feed my daughter and my little son
Till the day that I'm dead, better yet I'm gone
Come on

[Hook: C Wreck]
In this land of lost
I'll do what I do to survive
In this land of lost
I'll do what I do to survive

[Verse 2]
Feria makes the globe spin, thanks to all our taxes
Hidden fees for a student, Trying to take classes
Do we all have to pay? just to learn some knowledge
And a few years later pay some more for college
Should I start saving now? so my kids could attend school
It's like what? might as well hustle till late noon
If the dude gets caught, he's a bad guy on the news
Not knowing he was doing it to buy his kid shoes
Mug shot on TV, put his face on the cover
When his kids go to school, they get starred at by others
In the back of the bus with no one next to them
All the parents seen the news, so they lost a few friends
Little girl's growing up and the boy's getting older
Give the dad a couple months and his path is over
Most time another man steps in to his position
They warned him, now it's too late, he should've listened

[Hook: C Wreck]
In this land of lost
I'll do what I do to survive
In this land of lost
I'll do what I do to survive

[Verse 3]
In this life, you gotta watch your step ahead of time
Most of us sacrifice, just to make it through one night
Just stop pay attention, look all of these homeless
At a freeway exit, like they ready to protest
Probably had a rough life, wasted money getting high
While his children are home with no food to bite
Wife is stuck with the kids, no food up in the fridge
Till she got fed up and it happened quick
Now she's out on the corner, prostitution is her job
Working hard raining nights till she paid rent off
While her children are home, wondering if she's okay
At the same time praying, hoping she gets paid
Too late, you know what it actually isn't
When we all come together paint the perfect vision
HD if you want, so you see it much clear
But you won't see the problem till you look in the mirror

[Hook: C Wreck]
In this land of lost
I'll do what I do to survive
In this land of lost
I'll do what I do to survive
