[Verse 1]
Do you love me? cause I don't
Will you fuck me? cause I won't
Do you, so please can you move aside
Trying to pull on my sleeve
But I know your type
Let me explain a little somethin'
You can roll with a pro but we won't be fucking'
Take notes, quit buggin' before I set you free
Right now what you want is all me
OG in this game, I was drafted young
Before we get introduced I could have them sprung
I won't feed you lies I'll keep it real
If the pussy spit money
Then I'll seal the whole deal
Go in and show you who the fuck is boss
From now on raise your hand when you wanna talk
No spot in my heart you will have
Thanks to math I divide, legs
Then I subtract

[Hook: G Cash]
I, know your type
You know my kind
So move aside
Don't waste my time
I'm on my grind
But if it pays
Then stand outside

[Verse 2]
Let me tell you a little something bitch
You ain't ever gonna get this dick
Just cause plenty get to brag
Don't mean you will
Trying to pull on my sleeves
Slow your roll, hoe chill
How you feel? what's wrong?, I'm not asking that
I'm in to fresh air, so you need to get back
I been worried about my health for way too long
Now you wanna come around, uh uh move on
Keep your hands to yourself unless I say so
Go and stand on the corner bring me paper
No favor or credit, how can pussy take debit?
Go and hit an ATM, never mind the fetish
Cause a playa gotta get his chedda
Hustlin', pimping bitches or however
I don't mind how you get it, unless it comes
Just make sure you get change
I don't like to count ones

[Hook: G Cash]
I, know your type
You know my kind
So move aside
Don't waste my time
I'm on my grind
But if it pays
Then stand outside

[Verse 3]
If I met yo bitch, would you share?
Would you trip on a playa
Say it ain't fair
I treat my hoes equally, no difference to me
Pussy is pussy and bitches are bitches
Why the hell waste time trying to wine & dine
Knowing damn well after it's like move aside
Just let her ass know from the gate
How much dick can she take and bread can she make
One night is alright, overtime if needed
If you ever get caught better pray on Jesus
Cause ain't no pussy out there worth it
You can claim that yours is
But put on a skirt bitch
And stand outside and try to look cute
Smelling like cheap perfume mixed with absolute
Vodka sure to get you hot but I know your type
It could be freezing out there
But you're warm inside

[Hook: G Cash]
I, know your type
You know my kind
So move aside
Don't waste my time
I'm on my grind
But if it pays
Then stand outside
