[Chorus]
Baby I wanted to know (I wanna know)
If you wanna take a ride in my low low, baby baby
Baby I wanted to know (I wanna know)
If you wanna take a ride in my low low, baby baby

[Verse 1]
I wanna know if you down to cruise
We can do what you want to do
Up and down in them avenues
While we listen to oldie tunes, ha ha
I'm in my ride looking fresh and fly
Levis and Cortez, I don't have to try
Got my boys at the beach starting up the grill
Tell your friends if they wanna chill, look
We got Hennessy and Alize
And Coronas that are on their way
Girl it's Sunday, fun day, we about to turn up
One hand on the cup and the other a blunt
Steering wheel on this song 'cause I'm takin' a puff
Baby girl staring at me, look at my eyes
Telling me to open them, boy you look high
That's when I smiled and my ass replied like

[Chorus]
Baby I wanted to know (I wanna know)
If you wanna take a ride in my low low, baby baby
Baby I wanted to know (I wanna know)
If you wanna take a ride in my low low, baby baby

[Verse 2]
Now that the sun is going down
Everyone is gathered around
Freestylin' while others clown
All smiles girl, ain't no frowns, baby look
We about to light up on this Sunday night
We can cruise it, do what the hell you like
Front, back, side to side
Grab on while the Daytons glide
We can do it every single day
You can drive while my ass blaze
Getting high on the passenger side, girl let's ride
Make sure to hop the front when we come to the lot
If you turn right, make sure it's the back
And have everyone bouncing like the summer time track
Took a drink of my cup then I said what up?
That's when she smiled and said boy you're in love

[Chorus]
Baby I wanted to know (I wanna know)
If you wanna take a ride in my low low, baby baby
Baby I wanted to know (I wanna know)
If you wanna take a ride in my low low, baby baby

[Chorus]
Baby I wanted to know (I wanna know)
If you wanna take a ride in my low low, baby baby
Baby I wanted to know (I wanna know)
If you wanna take a ride in my low low, baby baby
