[Verse 1]
I want it all and playing ball like monopoly
And own properties, can't nobody stop a G
See everyone has their needs, dawg I have my own
I want a house on them hills I can call my home
A stash house I can lay low when times get rough
A false address comes in handy to avoid them cuffs
I can bet your life's tough, can you imagine mine?
I can say I'm doing great G, I'm doing alright
Recognize that your trash is another man's treasure
Fool where you from? I bang the 20th letter
Get your cheddar count them up, even if its [?]
Take your time baby boy, don't come out and stump
Put a front to these 5-0's especially your rivals
Plant your seed and make it grow just like some hydro
See I know it ain't easy but you gon' want a lot of things
When you start to come up

[Hook]
I want it all
I'm a ball like I'm Kobe
Get money any ways
It's like, G you know me
I want it all
In the hills blowing smoke
Having drinks
Sharing toast with family and folks
I want it all
I'm a ball like monopoly
And own properties
Can't nobody stop a G
I want it all

[Verse 2]
I hold the smoke before I let it go
And think to myself
How I went from doing bad to doing so well
I used to live in motel 6 with my family and kids
I just add it to my timeline, it is what it is
Barely had enough feria to buy some food
Coffee bean heated water for our ramen soup
That's for breakfast, lunch and dinner
We were cold for the summer and hot for the winter
No sweater or jacket to wear for the weather
Mamma worried cause her son rep'd that 20th letter
But I still did my thing and I helped out
To you hating jealous people, where you at now?
Many wished I failed plenty hoped I derailed
Used to work hard for my money
Now I get it in the mail
I'm above all of yall, I was born to ball
Didn't give a fuck then, now I want it all

[Hook]
I want it all
I'm a ball like I'm Kobe
Get money any ways
It's like, G you know me
I want it all
In the hills blowing smoke
Having drinks
Sharing toast with family and folks
I want it all
I'm a ball like monopoly
And own properties
Can't nobody stop a G
I want it all

[Verse 3]
I want it all
I'm a ball like I'm Kobe
Get money any ways
It's like, G you know me
My plan is to do big things
Give a c-note to the cracker
Let her keep the change
Sounds strange to us gutter fool
I know it does, few years a couple months
But I'm still comin' up
Hard work pays off that's what they said
Shit I be laying in my bed
When these flows come in to my head
Naturally I'm a fool
I got plenty of talent
Everyone has their own they just don't take advantage
Get it right, get it good, like a real one should
So when they ask how you doin'?
It's all to the good, Can't lie I'm doing bad
Let this mix release
2 weeks after that you can go and ask me
What the streets been fiending
G I had to do it
Brought to you by me and this gutter music

I want it all
