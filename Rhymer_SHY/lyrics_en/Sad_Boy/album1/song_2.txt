[Chorus]
For my gangsters, riders, gangsters, riders
For the homies doing time and the lifers
For my gangsters, riders, gangsters, riders
For the homies doing time and the lifers
For my gangsters, riders, gangsters, riders
For the homies doing time and the lifers
For my gangsters, riders, gangsters, riders
For the homies doing time and the lifers

[Verse 1]
I got some homies in the hole, keep that dirty on the low
Doing burpees 'til they swole and they let off parole
Their time's lost up in solitary
Two ways out, you gang bang up in jail, you get buried
RIP to Drowsy, I miss you perro
Shout out to Big Cisco, the fourth level
Sicky doin' time, fools been up in Pleasent
It's been years, tatted tears since his ass been arrested
Man Rico get you scared, don't judge a book by it's cover
That's a rider, a rider, a real motherfucker
I met hustlers, I met G's
I met riders but also met wannabes
My boy Chics, yeah gangster, also known as Chico
Put an end to your story and he left no sequel
We all evil, at least my peoples
Like playin' with the ouija board, we don't speak though

[Chorus]
For my gangsters, riders, gangsters, riders
For the homies doing time and the lifers
For my gangsters, riders, gangsters, riders
For the homies doing time and the lifers
For my gangsters, riders, gangsters, riders
For the homies doing time and the lifers
For my gangsters, riders, gangsters, riders
For the homies doing time and the lifers

[Verse 2]
I told my boy don't trip, I got you, serio
Call my ass up fool if you're ever in some peligro
I know there's times in this life where you think you can do it
It's not worth dyin' a hero ese, don't be stupid
Just choose the right time, especially the right place
Look around before you do it, tie a rag on your face
If you know you're gonna kill him, take it off, say your name
Flash your hood before his eyes homie, fuck that lame
I'm a hood motherfucker with some hood ties
We all know that thin line so you know I choose mine
Pass by, won't flash signs, I'm just tryna scope right
Your first homie to detach, yup, that's his life
Do or die in these times when you're roamin' outside
Yeah the cops can pass by but don't mean they save lives
Take your time and plot wise so they never link crimes
All these cops in the hood swear they're FBI

[Chorus]
For my gangsters, riders, gangsters, riders
For the homies doing time and the lifers
For my gangsters, riders, gangsters, riders
For the homies doing time and the lifers
For my gangsters, riders, gangsters, riders
For the homies doing time and the lifers
For my gangsters, riders, gangsters, riders
For the homies doing time and the lifers

[Outro]
For my gangsters, riders, gangsters, riders
For my gangsters, riders, gangsters, riders
For the homies doing time and the lifers
For my gangsters, riders, gangsters, riders
For my gangsters, riders, gangsters, riders
For the homies doing time and the lifers
