[Verse 1]
I'm still here motherfuckers
I ain't covered up with sheets
Same clip new strap
New hit same beef
Yeah i'm curious for my life
But it ain't one of my fears
Got stabbed 4 times
And i'm still fucking here
It was sunday afternoon
Everything was going smooth
Me and the homies just chillin' drinking brew
Nothing new, same fools, same gang, same name
Sad Boy Loko motherfuckers
And i'm here to stay
So when you pray
Mention me, Nacho and Nimo
Only difference i came back
And i made a fucken sequel
Same looks on me /ese/
But a different /Vato/
You have better luck of me
Dying diagnosed with cancer
So your mission was impossible
You bitches failed
Got rushed to the E.R
Got stitched and stabled
One fatal, the other 3 were baby wounds
So watch my soul walk off
On my stacey shoes
But i..

[Verse 2]
Now i'm laying down trippin'
With my mind going crazy
Don't know if i'm joker
Or i'm just hallucinating
As i look to my side
I see plenty of demons
Fuck the ripley show
/Ese/ i couldn't believe it
Started asking questions
Like "Am i fucking dead?"
As one of them replied
"You got stabbed In your neck"
Three times in your ribs
At least you heard your last breath
In loving memory of Sad Boy
With is now resting in peace
Surprise, to all those that hoped i died
I'm still here motherfucker
Yeah i'm still alive
I met the devil
And i asked him for one last wish
"Before i grant you this"
"Bring back the whole click"
Same day discharged
Now i'm after all you lops
Fuck the consequences /Ese/
I don't care about the ops
I'm worried about my damn soul
That my wish was granted for
Gotta get your whole varrio
Can't come up short

[Verse 3]
I'm the M.V.P
Most valuable player
Grab your cup
Fill it up
Here's a toast to my haters
Fools want me to fail
But i ain't gonna fucken quit
Live my life G
Till the day i rest in peace
But till then, motherfucker grab a number
I'm a real evil sider
A real fuckin hustler
Clock in clock out
Take hits blow clouds
Fuck Obama, nothing changed
Cause i'm still in the same route
And no doubt situations turning deadly
Motherfuckers out to get me
Believe me holmes there's plenty
But i can give a fuck who you are
It don't matter
Turn the lights on
Then watch them all scatter
Just like roaches
Just hoping i end up in a box
And Real G's don't talk
We just walk the walk
So watch me hush and pack a bowl
Inhale get blown
Cause that's the way i roll
