Thug life man we the king of the block
Riding that drop double R like Pac
Still kept shining even when them boys stop
I make country rap tunes, never did hip hop
That痴 why I ain稚 stop cause a hustla got slow
Here pow wow hurry up with my Moe
So slow gudda so flow oh flow
Got my sachet, shades on and the boot wherever I go
Keep a bad bitch matter of fact I keep plenty
Bad bitches I ain稚 hit, it ain稚 that many
Just wave em in just in case you get many
Got a pretty white bitch in Dallas back in 97
Old school flow make my city say man
My back on the budda same colour, Peter Pan
Waving at your bitch a hunnid thousand in my hand
Knock the window of the foreign looking so spic and span
Caught couple hundred grand if me see me on it
Wish I could send some fo so I can spend it
Everything paid for ain稚 shit rented
I smoke and drive so all my shit tinted
Balling to the limit you should see my hater痴 face
Knowing when I show up they back in last place
Moving at my own pace feeling too cool to race
When it comes to being a hustler put me with the greats

[Hook]
Yeah I知 stuntin when I知 on I知 getting
Hit the boulevard and I got the trunk hidden
On that drink everyday I stay sippin
