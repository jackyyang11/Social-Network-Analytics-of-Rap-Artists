[Intro: Doug E. Fresh]
Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Doug E Fresh and I'm with my girl Jill Scott
And we about to take it from the bottom to the top, aight?
Sing

[Verse 1: Jill Scott]
Never wanted to see things my way
Tell me why were you such a fool
Always thought the grass was greener on the other side
Never miss your water till your well run dry
And now I'm sad and so confused
Cause I'm all cried out, oh yeah yeah
Over you (mm hmm)
Over you (mm hmm)
Over you (mm hmm)
Over you you you you you
You, you, you [adlib]

(ah oh ah oh)

[Verse 2: Jill Scott]
No more tears for you, no baby it's all over
I'm moving on now, I'm taking over
No more tears for you, no more baby
Cause I'm not your lady
You made that perfectly clear to me too
Ooo so I'm gonna move to the next phase
Getting back into my space
Moving in right in the right direction
And oh oh
I hope you know
One day baby
That I-I-I-I-I-I-I'm not sad and so confused
Cause I'm all cried out oh yeah yeah
Over you
Over you
Over you
Over you
