[Pre-Chorus: Demun Jones]
When I show up you know it's goin' down (It's goin' down)
I got my county boys and the crown (Boys and the crown)
I hope they like noise in your town (They like noise in your town)
'Cause we're gonna wake the neighbors

[Chorus: Demun Jones]
And we're 'bouta shake the ground
And make it bang (Bang)
Backwards boys in the middle of the woods goin' bang (Bang)
We laugh, like I said we're comin' at ya
We make it bang (Bang)
Thirty off six in Deadwoods goin' bang (Bang)
And when we get on stage you know we make it bang (Bang)

[Verse 1]
Rock all day and rock all night
Throw your hands up high (Uh)
Try to reach the lights
Grab a hold of the sky boy
I'm [?]
[?] cross me muggin', got the sister straight bumpin'
Got the crowd straight bunkin'
Got the boy dancin' on beat 'cause they feel it ('Cause they feel it)
And I see haters makin' faces 'cause they know I'm 'bout to kill it
And it's guaranteed
Or double your money back
I'm trouble on money tracks 'cause I like money in stacks (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Demun Jones]
When I show up you know it's goin' down (It's goin' down)
I got my county boys and the crown (Boys and the crown)
I hope they like noise in your town (They like noise in your town)
'Cause we're gonna wake the neighbors

[Chorus: Demun Jones]
And we're 'bouta shake the ground
And make it bang (Bang, woo)
Backwards boys in the middle of the woods goin' bang (Bang)
We laugh, like I said we're comin' at ya
We make it bang (Bang)
Thirty off six in Deadwoods goin' bang (Bang)
And when we get on stage you know we make it bang (Bang)

[Verse 2: Charlie Farley]
They say dang when I pull up and hop out
'Cause I really wanna ride this train
But I laid these tracks by myself so no you can't (Can't)
From me but you could buy every song that I ever made
Ain't that the same? (Same)
When I show up, I show out
Like a backwoods boys does (Does)
I'm from the sticks in the south but I got me a bust (Bust)
All over the continent now
They're hooked like I'm drugs
And if it must be let's make sure I'm not cut 'cause I'm raw

[Pre-Chorus: Demun Jones]
When I show up you know it's goin' down (It's goin' down)
I got my county boys and the crown (Boys and the crown)
I hope they like noise in your town (They like noise in your town)
'Cause we're gonna wake the neighbors

[Chorus: Demun Jones]
And we're 'bouta shake the ground
And make it bang (Bang, woo)
Backwards boys in the middle of the woods goin' bang (Bang)
We laugh, like I said we're comin' at ya
We make it bang (Bang)
Thirty off six in Deadwoods goin' bang (Bang)
And when we get on stage you know we make it bang (Bang)
(Come on everybody)

[Verse 3: Demun Jones]
But I'm hot sauce
You felt lost when it popped off
Now I've got 'em jumpin' (Jumpin', jumpin', jumpin', jumpin', jumpin')
Hot sauce, you felt lost when it popped off
Now I've got 'em jumpin' and we 'bouta to blow the top off
If y'all came to rock out now then let me hear you scream (Woo)
Man it's guaranteed, Demun Jones, I'm bringin' back
And every city is packed (Yeah)
And I'm doin' it back-to-back (Yeah)
(Woo, Charlie Farley, Demun Jones)

[Chorus: Demun Jones]
We're 'bouta shake the ground
And make it bang (Bang, woo)
Backwards boys in the middle of the woods goin' bang (Bang)
We laugh, like I said we're comin' at ya
We make it bang (Bang)
Thirty off six in Deadwoods goin' bang (Bang)
And when we get on stage you know we make it bang (Bang)
