[Chorus]
Cocaine, my friends say that I'm different
Cocaine, things keep comin' up missin'
Cocaine, my face it don't look the same
Where did I get these chains?

[Bridge]
Why yeah they tried to tell me, but of course I already knew
I knew it all about everything that's what a knucklehead like me do
I never thought that I would have the chance or it would catch my eye
Or somebody laid me out a line that I'd give a try

[Verse 1]
Well it came to me in weakness, I had been in pain
Gettin' used to livin' with just my pops was quite a change
Sports was my life and I thought that I was in love
But I got kicked off the team and she wasn't what I thought she was
And here came the clue, that showed me something brand new
And naw I ain't blamin' them it took a knucklehead like me to do

[Chorus]
Cocaine, my friends say that I'm different
Cocaine, things keep comin' up missin'
Cocaine, my face it don't look the same
Where did I get these chains?

[Verse 2]
Now it wasn't all at once but the direction was down
Gradually lower and lower and lower
And when it wore off, there came that pain
Same as before so this time I take a little more
And to numb myself I would do ridiculous amounts
Even the dealer told me man you need to chill out
I said I'm Santa Claus and I want my milk and cookies
I'll give you exactly what you want for that bag of goodies
And that was strange for him 'cause we had always been friends
But I crossed the line and became a customer

[Chorus]
Cocaine, my friends say that I'm different
Cocaine, things keep comin' up missin'
Cocaine (cocaine), my face it don't look the same
Where did I get these chains?

[Bridge]
Why yeah they tried to tell me, but of course I already knew
I knew it all about everything that's what a knucklehead like me do
I never thought that I would have the chance or it would catch my eye
Or somebody laid me out a line that I'd give a try

[Chorus]
Cocaine, my friends say that I'm different
Cocaine, things keep comin' up missin'
Cocaine (cocaine), my face it don't look the same
Where did I get these chains?
Where did I did I get these chains?

[Outro]
That was my cocaine episode
