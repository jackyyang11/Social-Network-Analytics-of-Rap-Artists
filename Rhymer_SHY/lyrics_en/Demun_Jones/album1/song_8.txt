[Chorus]
(Do you know?)
It don't matter where you come from, where you pay rent, as long as you represent it
(Do you know?)
Hold the world with no gloves so your hands get tough, until it's quittin' time don't ease up
(Do you know?)
It don't matter where you come from, where you pay rent, as long as you represent it
(Do you know?)
On them county roads we roll, we've come so far, but we still got so far to go
(Do you know?)

[Verse 1]
What you know about them tree colored clothes
Chillin' up in the blind, gettin' loaded with your bros
What you know about that Zebco throwin' all day
I ain't caught a thing still I got a smile on my face
What you know about them backroads that go across county lines
And if they paved, they ain't got no stripes or speed limit signs
And did you know that everywhere I go
I keep it hometown, it's embedded in my soul, oh
And do you know what it's like to work until your hands bleed
And spend every last penny for what the family needs
And if you don't you need to tighten up
It takes more to bein' a man than having a beard or a truck
That's what's up

[Chorus]
(Do you know?)
It don't matter where you come from, where you pay rent, as long as you represent it
(Do you know?)
Hold the world with no gloves so your hands get tough, until it's quittin' time don't ease up
(Do you know?)
It don't matter where you come from, where you pay rent, as long as you represent it
(Do you know?)
On them county roads we roll, we've come so far, but we still got so far to go
(Do you know?)

[Verse 2]
What you know about that music up, windows rolled down
Ridin' around in circles, doin' laps all around the town
And even further out in Jones County when it's dark
And them dirt road riders are blendin' in with the bark
What you know about parkin' on the hill to chill
And y'all are welcome to join us if you can find the field
Got a row of Dixie dimes sittin' across the tailgate
Gotta get up early in the mornin' but they stayin' out late
And did you know my buddy in that beat up truck
He got a couple thousand acres, worth 10 million bucks
But you would never know, he wouldn't tell you if you asked him
When country folk got it ain't no need in bein' flashy

[Chorus]
(Do you know?)
It don't matter where you come from, where you pay rent, as long as you represent it
(Do you know?)
Hold the world with no gloves so your hands get tough, until it's quittin' time don't ease up
(Do you know?)
It don't matter where you come from, where you pay rent, as long as you represent it
(Do you know?)
On them county roads we roll, we've come so far, but we still got so far to go
(Do you know?)

[Outro]
Do you know who you are? (who you are)
Or where you came from?  (came from)
(Do you know?)
Folks you came up with (folks you came up with)
They still got your back (they still got your back)
