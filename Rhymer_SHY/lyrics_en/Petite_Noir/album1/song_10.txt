[Verse 1]
Did you know you're beautiful?
In every single way
Love is just so magical
I love it any day
And you know now
I love you till the motherfucking very end
Just don't
Or you're gonna be my very end
Just don't
Or you're gonna be my heaven sent

[Chorus]
'Cause you're the one that I want
You're the one that I need
'Cause you're the one that I want
You're the one that I need
'Cause you're the one that I want
You're the one that I need
'Cause you're the one that I want
You're the one that I need

[Verse 2]
Did you know you're magical
I'm caught up every day
Our love is just so music
It's melody over ways
Bet you know now
I love you till the motherfucking very end
Just don't

[Chorus]
'Cause you're the one that I want
You're the one that I need
'Cause you're the one that I want
You're the one that I need
'Cause you're the one that I want
You're the one that I need
'Cause you're the one that I want
You're the one that I need

[Verse 3]
Did you know it's a hole inside
Apology or no apology
'Cause you're the one that I want
You're the one that I need
Did you know if you walk me now
I'll kneel it down, on both my knees

[Chorus]
'Cause you're the one that I want
You're the one that I need
'Cause you're the one that I want
You're the one that I need
'Cause you're the one that I want
You're the one that I need
'Cause you're the one that I want
You're the one that I need
