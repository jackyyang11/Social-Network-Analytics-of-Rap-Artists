I don’t know
But you’re taking me for a fool, boy
You don’t know
So you tell me to stay cool, boy
Haven’t had you around
For a while (it’s real shit right here)
That’s what I’m saying
Take you to my other friends
They'll show you as well
See, I can live, it’s possible
That I can breathe, it’s possible
I can dance, it’s possible
And I can smile again, it’s possible
With or without you

Tell me, boy
Do you really think we’re gonna make it?
I don’t know
Let’s pretend that nothing went on

If you can come
I will show you love and affection
Where you now?
Should’ve been hiding pictures
Tell me, girl
Do you really think I wanna break up?
Tell me, now
You gotta be there when I wake up

Don’t need to sell my soul
Cause you already came out of nowhere
Tell me where you’re going, girl
Go to church and pray for me
Checkmate
I’m going back to my goodness
Tell me now
So I know, so I know, so I know

Hold on
To what we had
To what we did
It’s what you wanted
We gotta go back, gotta go back, gotta go back, gotta go back
Hold on
To what we had
To what we did
It’s what you wanted
We gotta go back, gotta go back, gotta go back, gotta go back
