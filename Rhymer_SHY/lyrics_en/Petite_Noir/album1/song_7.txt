[Verse 1]
Are you ready?
Do you really wanna go at five?
Are you coming?
I really wanna go all night
Keep your money
I'm not going on my knees
Tell me now
Are things gonna be alright?

[Chorus 1]
Cause we not going (down)
We not going (down)

[Verse 2]
Don't be lazy
Let's just drive all night
It drives me crazy
But I'm gonna be alright
Down, down, down all the way
No, not this time
Tell me now
Are things gonna be alright?

[Chorus 2]
We not going (down)
We not going (down)
We not going (down)
You're not going
We not going
You're not going
We not going (down)
You're not going
We not going
We not going down

[Bridge]
Down, down, down, down
Spinning my world around, 'round, 'round, 'round
We not going down, down, down, down
Turn my world around, 'round, 'round, 'round
We not going down, down, down, down

[Outro]
We not going (down)
We not going (down)
We not going (down)
We not going (down)
We not going (down)
We not going (down)
We not going (down)
We not going (down)
