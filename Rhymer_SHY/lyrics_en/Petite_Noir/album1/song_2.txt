[Verse 1]
Don't you wanna take me under?
I really wanna go
Don't you wanna be my lover?
Don't take it so slow
But you know I've been about it
You're too slow for me
I just don't know what you will do

[Chorus]
I don't care what you won't do
So please just go back home
I don't care what you won't do
So please just go back home

[Verse 2]
Don't take me or break me
I'll fight for myself
The King's above me
And there's nobody else
Don't stand in my way
I won't answer your call
You're being so dirty
You're being so dirty

[Chorus]
I don't care what you won't do
So please just go back home
I don't care what you won't do
So please just go back home

[Verse 3]
You're being so dirty
You're being so dirty
You took the time to show me straight to the door
You told me now we can have so much more
I wrote a letter just to settle the score
You played games with me 'til I fell to the floor
You took me 'round and 'round
You took me 'round and 'round
You took me 'round and 'round
And 'round and 'round some more
You took me 'round and 'round
You took me 'round and 'round
You took me 'round and 'round
And 'round and 'round some more
