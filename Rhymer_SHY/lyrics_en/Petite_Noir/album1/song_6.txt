Only you can make me feel the same
(Only you can make me feel the same)
Only you can make me feel the pain
(Only you can make me feel the pain)
When I fall, you welcome me inside
(When I fall, you welcome me inside)
You are not my only sacrifice
(You are not my only sacrifice) No, No
Only you can make me feel the same
(Only you can make me feel the same)
Only you can make me feel the pain
(Only you can make me feel the pain)
When I fall, you welcome me inside
(When I fall, you welcome me inside)
You are not my only sacrifice, no, no
(You are not my only sacrifice) No, No
...

Only you can make me feel the same
(Only you can make me feel the same)
Only you can make me feel the pain
(Only you can make me feel the pain)
When I fall, you welcome me inside
(When I fall, you welcome me inside)
You are not my only sacrifice
(You are not my only sacrifice)
Only you can make me feel the same
(Only you can make me feel the same)
Only you can make me feel the pain
(Only you can make me feel the pain)
When I fall, you make me feel again
(When I fall, you welcome me inside)
You are not my only sacrifice
(You are not my only sacrifice)

You know it's true
Loving is untrue
Waiting for tomorrow
To come, to come
You know it's true
There's something about you
Waiting for tomorrow
To come, to come
To come, to come
To come, to come
To come, to come
