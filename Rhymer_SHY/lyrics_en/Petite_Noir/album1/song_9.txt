[Verse:]
Say the word
She said be the change you want to see
Breathe the air you would like to breathe
Don’t stand in the way of yourself
And don’t take me away from myself, from myself
Just breathe [x3]
Don’t breathe a word
She said be the change you want to see
Fate will choose you and me
I don’t want to fear the world too and
And don’t take me away from myself, from myself
Just, just breathe
Just breathe [x2]
Just breathe (just breathe)
Just breathe
Just breathe (just breathe) [x5]
