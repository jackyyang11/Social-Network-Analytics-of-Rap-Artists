[Intro]
Better check your resources

[Chorus]
Yeah and I'ma shit on niggas in the winter (shit)
And when I go the war, I don't surrender (bitch)
Yeah, and I don't take a freaky bitch to dinner (ho)
Ooh, I been gettin' money, you just a beginner

[Verse 1]
All that slick talkin' that gon' get yo' head cracked
All my bitches gotta walk 'til they bring some bread back
And my soldiers can't go home 'til they bring your head back
They took purple off the market but they brought the red back
I might jump up in that Maybach, just to let head back
I might run off on my plug and don't bring the bread back
I remember way back, bro I'm talkin' way back
And them pussy niggas runnin' from me like a scared cat
When you run into them pussy nigga, tell 'em I said that
You might get your son back but can't get his legs back
All that comin' on Instagram, I read that
When I get through with yo' bitch, you can get a head back
Thank you

[Chorus]
Yeah and I'ma shit on niggas in the winter (shit)
And when I go the war, I don't surrender (bitch)
Yeah, and I don't take a freaky bitch to dinner (ho)
Ooh, I been gettin' money, you just a beginner (slow)

[Verse 2]
Boy, you think I'm really lyin' on these songs? (ho)
You don't think I really come up on them slums (no)
You don't wanna see me pull up with them drums (ghost)
All that talkin' and shit, I might cut your tongue (throat)
I been blockin' that bitch when she hit my home (beep)
I be rockin' that shit, it's in my perform (gang-gang)
I be poppin' that shit, oh she let it burn
We be tossin' that bitch, we be takin' turns
I don't go nowhere without my Glock ho (hey)
I can't go outside without my socks ho (uh)
I got bread on my line, I'm talkin' 'bout guapo
I got the feds right behind me, time to hop over (nope)

[Chorus]
Yeah and I'ma shit on niggas in the winter (shit)
And when I go the war, I don't surrender (bitch)
Yeah, and I don't take a freaky bitch to dinner (ho)
Ooh, I been gettin' money, you just a beginner (slow)
