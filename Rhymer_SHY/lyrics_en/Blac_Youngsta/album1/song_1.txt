[Intro]
What up bitch
I’m on my—I’m on my Boosie Badazz shit right now nigga
You know what I’m saying, one time to the OG, legend

[Chorus]
(Fight)
You know, ain’t no one on one
On one on, one on one (fight)
You know, ain’t no one on one
On one on, one on one (fight)
You know we gon' jump on jump
Jump on jump (fight)
You know we gon' jump on jump
Jump on, jump on jump (fight)
You know, ain’t no one on one
On one on, one on one (fight)
You know, ain’t no one on one
On one on, one on one (fight)
You know, ain’t no one on one
On one on, one on one (fight)
You know we gon' jump on jump
Jump on, jump on jump (fight)

[Verse 1]
If my bitch take her makeup, lipstick and her wig off
We gone hit like a chainsaw, it’s a jigsaw
I got sticks, I might get you hit, if I’m pissed off
Touch my bitch, I might cut your throat and your wrists off (gang, gang)
Kumbaya, Kumbayay, I’m so gang, gang-related
And my opps know I don’t play
And the cops know, I was straight
Hey lil' bitch, you out of place
If she pull up, she gon' pay
All this drip, I’m out of space
I’m somewhere that I don’t stay

[Bridge]
I can’t let my dawg fight you one on one (whoop that hoe)
You too big, he too small, we ain’t goin'
So we gon' jump yo ass for no reason (bitch)
Beat that bitch towards seizure
Everybody take an ass-whoopin' one day
Better be glad you breathin' (fight)

[Chorus]
You know, ain’t no one on one
On one on, one on one (fight)
You know, ain’t no one on one
On one on, one on one (fight)
You know we gon' jump on jump
Jump on jump (fight)
You know we gon' jump on jump
Jump on, jump on jump (fight)
You know, ain’t no one on one
On one on, one on one (fight)
You know, ain’t no one on one
On one on, one on one (fight)
You know, ain’t no one on one
On one on, one on one (fight)
You know we gon' jump on jump
Jump on, jump on jump (fight)

[Verse 2]
Badass syndicated
Ask my hood, I been their favorite
4-5 have you penetrated
Pull up on you, give you demonstrations
Dump on 'em out of new Mercedes
Face shot, that’s an invitation
You invited to my smoke party
'Bout my money, boy I get impatient
If you late, that’s an increase
Half them niggas, they against me
Half them bitches wanna kiss me
If I was still on my ten speed
4-5 have you penetrated
Pull up on you, give you demonstrations
Dump on 'em out of new Mercedes
Face shot that’s an invitation
(License and registration)
Where yo I.D.?
I’m on them backstreets
Come and try me
If she fine I might poke her like an I.V. (stick it)
Looking for a killer, you can hire me (first)
Black MJ can’t dye me (degree)
Got enough money you can buy her (murder)
But you ain't got enough money to buy me (gang-gang, gang)

[Chorus]
You know, ain’t no one on one
On one on, one on one (fight)
You know, ain’t no one on one
On one on, one on one (fight)
You know we gon' jump on jump
Jump on jump (fight)
You know we gon' jump on jump
Jump on, jump on jump (fight)
You know, ain’t no one on one
On one on, one on one (fight)
You know, ain’t no one on one
On one on, one on one (fight)
You know, ain’t no one on one
On one on, one on one (fight)
You know we gon' jump on jump
Jump on, jump on jump (fight)
