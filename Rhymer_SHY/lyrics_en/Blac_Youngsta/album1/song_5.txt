[Intro]
C-M-G
Rich nigga, rich nigga, rich nigga, rich nigga, rich nigga, rich nigga!

[Hook]
I don't give a lil' nigga if I lose my money I'mma rob you back for it
I don't trust these niggas, I don't love these niggas, I can't turn my back towards 'em
Took my bitch to Louis Vuitton, took her shopping, she ain't even ask for it
Rich nigga, young rich nigga ridin', let me get it 300 on the dashboard
Put a choppa to these pussies, speakin' down on my name, lil' nigga you done asked for it
I'm a young rich nigga, went and got it on my own, lil' nigga ain't ask for it
I bought my bitch new rollers, new car, she ain't even have to ask for it
If you my partner, you ain't got to have [?], you ain't even have to ask for it
