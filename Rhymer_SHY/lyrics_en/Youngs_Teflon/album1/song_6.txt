[Verse 1]
I've been in these streets since knee high
Way back, I'm talking stone washed Levi's
Can't vouch for them other dudes but we lie
To stay at lengths with the stress we gotta keep high
So I shout my nigga bones for a three-five
And fall back in my zone when my trees light
Only money made me come out of my deep highs
Not even honeys made me come out of my beehive
Time to mash some work, I roll my sleeves high
'Cos Lord knows we far from angels but we try
And this is how I'm stuck until my P's right
Hit a lick and make it home before tea time
Then I hit you with a deep rhyme
Fam the judges hit my bro-dee with a steep nine
Akh I'm tired of the street life
Barely time, I try to leave that's when she cried

[Hook]
*Don't stop ever loving me*
(That's all she says to me)
*Don't stop ever loving me*
(But I swear the roads is dead to me)
*Don't stop ever loving me*
(She keeps saying that)
*Don't stop ever loving me*

[Verse 2]
You the reason my brudda went can
You caused a lot of stress my bruddas went 'Dam
Uh... you taught us how to make the ten bang
Ten bags for the hammers beefing them man
I'm in the ends fam, you know the post code
Married to the streets, no honeymoon, the roads cold
Dem boy can't drive through 'ere like the roads closed
Forty with the tarnished metal, that's that rose gold
She told me "Don't you ever stop loving me"
Hear her voice every night and it troubles me
But I need a pathway out this fuckery
Made the nina bust, she said "Don't ever stop clutching me"
Good good brown in and she uckin' me
Only hot gyal get on top of me
And all them other yutes still think of topping me
Had to stop loving the roads, she wasn't loving me

[Outro]
*Don't stop ever loving me*
*Don't stop ever loving me*
*Don't stop ever loving me*
*Don't stop ever loving me*
*Don't stop ever loving me*
*Don't stop ever loving me*
*Don't stop ever loving me*
*Don't stop ever loving me*
