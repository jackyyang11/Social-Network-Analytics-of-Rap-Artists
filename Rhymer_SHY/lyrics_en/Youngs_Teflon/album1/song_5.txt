[Chorus : Youngs Teflon]

As a young boy I liked Robocop
(As a young boy I liked Robocop)
Shortly after that it was Rambo
(Shortly after that it was Rambo)
Them time there we kicked ball 'nuff
(Them time there we kicked ball 'nuff)
I used to play up front, I used to bang goals
(I used to play up front, I used to bang goals)
But now I'm riding round with my white don
(But now I'm riding round with my white don)
I ain't got no master, I'm Django
(I ain't got no master, I'm Django)
I keep a camel clutched on my Kangol's
(I keep a camel clutched on my Kangol's)
And I play my weapon like a banjo

[Verse 1 : Youngs Teflon)

I'm from South Central like the Wayan's dem
(I'm from South Central like the Wayan's dem)
I keep it loud special for the wagan's dem
(I keep it loud special for the wagan's dem)
If we ever caught a lick then we was staining them
(Caught a lick then we was staining them)
Then we sold the zed's without weighing them
(Then we sold the zed's without weighing them)
See I loved RoboCop as a yute man
(I loved Robocop as a yute man)
I had my plastic hammer, I'll shoot man
(With my plastic hammer I'll shoot man)
Couple older dons tried recruit man
(Couple older dons tried recruit man)
But I wasn't poppin' alone I weren't yute gang
(Poppin' alone I weren't yute gang)
And now I'm skating round with my white boy
Steve-O, us man are wild boys
Quiet bitches, loud toys
Noisy weed, that's our noise
Back in the day I'd probably take your phone
Same victims pray I don't make it home
I keep my Rambo [?]
And I mack dust with Davy Jones

[Chorus : Youngs Teflon]

As a young boy I liked Robocop

I ain't got no master, I'm Django
(I ain't got no master, I'm Django)
I keep a camel clutched on my Kangol's
(I keep a camel clutched on my Kangol's)
And I play my weapon like a banjo

[Verse 2 : Mental K]

As a young boy I liked Robocop
(As a young boy I liked Robocop)
Shortly after that it was Rambo
(Shortly after that it was Rambo)
Now these young boys roll with Rambo's
Play the center of the pitch like Sandro
Move through you, watch a man go
Them times there we kicked ball 'nuff
All I wanted was some R9's
But mum... wanted me back by half nine
I was tryna suck man for a hard nine
Half buj, half light
Bally on with my star-nine
Man down when I bark mine
Man united like Tevez
Now it's man's city like Tevez
Busting jobs and finessing
Rob the package, keep flexing
As a young boy I watched wrestling
I got stone cold when I was pressing it
Heavy metal, no RoboCop
And I'll retouch your face, no Photoshop

[Chorus : Youngs Teflon]

As a young boy I liked Robocop
(As a young boy I liked Robocop)
Shortly after that it was Rambo
(Shortly after that it was Rambo)
Them time there we kicked ball 'nuff
(Them time there we kicked ball 'nuff)
I used to play up front, I used to bang goals
(I used to play up front, I used to bang goals)
But now I'm riding round with my white don
(But now I'm riding round with my white don)
I ain't got no master, I'm Django
(I ain't got no master, I'm Django)
I keep a camel clutched on my Kangol's
(I keep a camel clutched on my Kangol's)
And I play my weapon like a banjo

[Verse 3 : Scrooge McDuffle]

As a young boy I liked BraveStarr
(As a young boy I liked BraveStarr)
Scalextric still we got play cars
(Scalextric still we got play cars)
Boy Rambo since then manna play hard
(Boy Rambo since then manna play hard)
So in the Jungle Book you couldn't take ours
(So in the Jungle Book you couldn't take ours)
I keep the Nunchucks, Michelangelo
And when I cop the 'rari I'm Django
I got the chopper on me so I'm Rambo
Or even Wolverine, that's in my hands though
That's that fire on me, let Sam know
Took his lady faster than Tramp though
On a Wednesday night in we ramp yo
Keep the Pepé Le Pew in, that's dank bro
As a young boy I made 'nuff sales
(As a young boy I made 'nuff sales)
And in my postcode they know Duffs well
(And in my postcode they know Duffs well)
Couldn't sit and wait 'fore that luck fell
(Couldn't sit and wait 'fore that luck fell)
Took a swim in money like the DuckTales
(Swim in money like DuckTales)
