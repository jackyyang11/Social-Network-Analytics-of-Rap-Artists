[Verse]
I ain't got time to waste time
Some niggas misuse talent I can't waste mine
I'm tryna (skrrr!) not worry 'bout train times
Same time my niggas running cocaine lines
And rappers running these flows like they ain't mine
Take time when Tiny and Matic take nines
Won't let the pigs take me like they take shines
Still won't refuse a lick move just to take shine
Got an old ting I'm tryna make mine
I'm always busy she said "First you gotta make time"
Got niggas in the kitchen tryna make shine
Spend a bit on the raw and it should bake fine
Then switch the phone on they say "It's cake time"
Smooth criminal, I moonwalk between the jake lines
Too many rats giving jake's dimes
Too many rappers telling fake rhymes
Too many trappers wearing fake shine
And too many clappers got a fake nine
Me I'm on the go cah' it's chase time
Get birded off of CCTV that's that FaceTime
I'm still trillin' with my main slime
Round here there's way too many dimes that I ain't pined
I got that wood, when they fuck me I just tell 'em wine
Then pour me up some wine and roll up my line
Shout out them G's still doing bait crimes
Stupid nigga just came home from his eighth time
No pen, no biro but it's straight fine
You know I usually set the tone before my eighth line
Your chick playing round with johnny's and some Vase-line
Said she don't wan' suck your dick but she ate mine
Then I hammered it down to the baseline
After that she wrote to you like "I'ma save time"
From the jungle where only apes climb
Up the food chain ladder so it's raise time
I smell a pig from a mile cah' I hate swine
And I can see through grass I ain't snake blind
(Said I can see through grass I ain't snake blind)
