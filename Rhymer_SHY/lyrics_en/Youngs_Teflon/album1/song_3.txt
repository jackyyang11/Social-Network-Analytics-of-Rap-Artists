[Verse 1]
I jump in the pot
I jumped out the frying pan into the fire
The heat was too hot (fire!)
Had to cop me some gloves
A couple of my friends got skenged on the way
Had to cop me a shove (RIP)
Said the line went dead
OT came home and I got me a plug (jug, jug)
I got me a jug (aight)
Makin' drinks all night
I shoulda' just copped me a club (I should've)
Stead I copped me a snub (big one)
Then I got me some laces
You should watch how they fit
Said I'm the jungle boy, I grew up with the cubs (the wolves)
Rass in the buds
I used to kick ball erryday
I still got class on my studs
Now I got an army of tugs (gang)
Gang full of pengting all on my whatsapp
I don't even answer to scrubs (not ever)
Got 'em wetter than a bath in the tub (splash, splash, splash)
I pass 'em my truck (skr)
I got it on my lap right now
In firearms I trust (I trust 'em)
I pray for the souls of my young dargs 'cause they woulda' been like us (RIP)
Yeah I believe in God, I can't believe he took my pups (my puppies)
It's mad
I pray on the rug (Alhamdulillah)
I still keep a ripper in my boxers but if it ain't hate then it's love (then it's cool)
I can't even trust my blower
Threw it away 'cause it's [?] (I dashed it)
Can't even trust my chick
Threw it away 'cause she's [?] (I dashed that)
Aight
One foot in the mud (spun)
One foot in the scene
This thing in my hoodie could send me to scrubs ([?])
Still I'm shellin' the dubs (still I'm shellin' 'em)
Loadin' the semi with love ( I love it)
Told bro don't fill it to the top cuh' that's how the skeng won't budge (it's cool)
Just cop one in the head and cotch (it's cool)
I'm married to the mob (the mafia)
If a guy's gotta go then a guy's gotta go
All we need is a nod (right now)
Comin' up a street with the rod (right now)
Man ah' been soft from school
When they used to take man's pogs (that's primary)
Like they out here tryna act tough
Like say they can man's dogs
They don't take man much (don't)
If your boy really wanna get wasted then you ain't gotta take man pub
I go get the milly and rock (it's rocky)
A new girl got a nigga in shape
Now they callin' man Rob (Kardashian)
Fresh off probation, I been gone since 2014 Nov (I'm back)
