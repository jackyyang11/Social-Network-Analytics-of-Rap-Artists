[Hook: S Loud]
Spend most of my time on the grind
Hustling to get high
And the game don't love you
The game don't love you like it should
Oh my
Ten, twenties and the fifties
Ten, twenties and the fifties
Collect the change from the case
Ten, twenties and the fifties
Ten, twenties and the fifties
Ten, twenties and the fifties
Collect the change from the case
Ten, twenties and the fifties

[Verse 1: Youngs Teflon]
Jimmy never had a cosign
Look, Jimmy never had a gold mine
Look, all I had was a gold flow
Yeah I had a gold mine and a chrome nine
But that's old time
My young girl, all she wanna listen to is gang shit
But I don't mind though
'Cause those are niggas that I bang with
I'm in my hood doing badness
Same night, I got two shows
Stuck between doing road and doing music
I swear to you it's a madness
But anything I got was all from the grind
I came from the ground
Then I just blew up fam, was all in the mind
I make the road and rap all intertwined
Man dry snitching on the internet about gang shit
You been a swine
Said my young bull go kway out
Then he spoon it out when it's dinner time
I don't rave much, I hold private parties
And the dress code, straight pengtings
Soon pullin' up in suttin' mental
Make niggas wish it was rented
See my lifestyle, half splendid
Other half is just drug houses
Live rounds and robberies
And these rap wars don't bother me

[Hook: S Loud]
Spend most of my time on the grind
Hustling to get high
And the game don't love you
The game don't love you like it should
Oh my
Ten, twenties and the fifties
Ten, twenties and the fifties
Collect the change from the case
Ten, twenties and the fifties
Ten, twenties and the fifties
Ten, twenties and the fifties
Collect the change from the case
Ten, twenties and the fifties

[Verse 2: Youngs Teflon]
Tens, twenties and fifties
My Benzes, Bimmers and Bentleys
I'll fuck around with them, fuck around
And niggas always on empty
Rip the ting 'til it's empty
Rip the work 'til it's splendid
Make the hits 'til we break tru
Money trees and I'm Kendrick

[Bridge: Youngs Teflon]
I work hard on this grind
Everyday I'm tryna get it off my line
But the game don't love you
And the strays might touch you in my hood
That's no lie
'Cause Jimmy never had a handout
'Cause Jimmy never had his hand out
But Jimmy always had a gang out
And nine millies for a bangout
But the game don't love you
But the game don't love you like it should

[Hook: S Loud]
Spend most of my time on the grind
Hustling to get high
And the game don't love you
The game don't love you like it should
Oh my
Ten, twenties and the fifties
Ten, twenties and the fifties
Collect the change from the case
Ten, twenties and the fifties
Ten, twenties and the fifties
Ten, twenties and the fifties
Collect the change from the case
Ten, twenties and the fifties
