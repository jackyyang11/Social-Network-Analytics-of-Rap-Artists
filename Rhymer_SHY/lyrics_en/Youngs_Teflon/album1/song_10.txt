[Intro: Young Teflon]
Yeah...It's that 16 shit...Loud on the keys..Ay yo

[Verse: Young Teflon]
I played the summer in a snapback
You know me and if she peng I'd probably tap that
With my Gs we en route to pick the package up
There go poppy in the big truck backin up
My little niggas don't listen more
Heard they robbed some little nigga for abit of raw
And that bit of raw had to get split in 4
I said before you burnt the good you shoulda picked up more
I was 17 posted by the liquor store
9 had 17 plus the pretty 4
Funny dude tryna tell me that a heat he saw
But she a holder, she ain't yours, but we supposed to war?
I don't understand, still keep a cunnin plan
Been nice since we was doin Runnin-Man
Electric slide in the [?]
Now I put a 4 and dab on the pro tools
I keep a smile, but you don't know what I go through
Cause smile in the sun now I was told true
Face smile wanna feelin 90 [?]
And I smile when I do you like Goku
Super-Saiyan level 4 on your bitch-arse
Yellow hair on my weed when I skid past
Silly dag tryna act like she the ting now
Face full of make-up that's a bitch mask
But y'all destined for greatness
I don't come up much fest tryna shake this
I fall back, I hold the meds on the grave shift
You know my style, I'm puff daddy, tell em take this
Baby baby, my lifestyle crazy
Pair of Ray-Bans movin shady
Some a half Z now I'm doin lazy
I tell a rich bitch fuck me then pay me
