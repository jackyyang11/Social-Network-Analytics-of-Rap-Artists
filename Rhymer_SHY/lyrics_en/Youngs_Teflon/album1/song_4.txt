[Chorus]

We on that Crud ting, we don't really care
Spliff in our mouth, middle finger in the air
We on that Crud ting, bring him over here
Light the sucker up then we fling him in the air
We on a Crud tip, we don't really care
Spliff in our mouth, middle finger in the air
We on a Crud tip, bring him over here
Light the sucker up then we fling him in the air

[Verse 1]

These rappers don't stress me
I was reminiscing bangin' old S.P
You know that LOX ish, no pop ish
Notes went in on the beat now I got this
Then we discuss, how my discs was
Picky head twist off hanging Kris Kross
Remember when I got my first pair of Mish Mosh
Chino jeans I felt fly that was lift off
Even though it was a rip off
I remember the trey-deuce with the six shots
I remember the first stick job
Don was kissing on the steel like lip gloss
Like... we just got the tip off
Wrap the piff up then we drop the prick off
You know donny got battered like a chip shop
Gotta keep it moving like the clock homie tick tock
Me? I just do what it diz does
Still fling kitties food like a discus
You better know it's lunch time when the fifth buss
'Cos I can leave corn where your ribs was
Metal on me, more shells than Easter
Bought the pepperoni like you ordered a pizza
Eyes red you can call it the cheese darg
I don't smoke pipe nah it's normally the reefa
We are yeah i said it we are
But I mean I am, killing rappers E.R
I don't want your fans nah, not me star
I want my own empire, Julius Caesar
You find out what I did with your wife? You would leave her
Let's just say we're really good friends and I please her
When I get the urge I just might tease her
Choco balls all up in her mouth, Malteser
So disrespectful, no damn right manners
This is for the jack boys and the all night slangers
The youngers in the stairways, all night hangers
For the riders who got a bag of nails for the hammers
Do it everyday, yeah we do it every week
Still got them others say that we through with the streets
Damn right liars, gram white suppliers
Still real G's never sang to the wire

[Chorus]

We on that Crud ting, we don't really care
Spliff in our mouth, middle finger in the air
We on that Crud ting, bring him over here
Light the sucker up then we fling him in the air
We on a Crud tip, we don't really care
Spliff in our mouth, middle finger in the air
We on a Crud tip, bring him over here
Light the sucker up then we fling him in the air
