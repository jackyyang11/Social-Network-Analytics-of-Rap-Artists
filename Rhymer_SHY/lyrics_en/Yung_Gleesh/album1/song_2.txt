[Intro]
Man oh man you should all the friends we have here in [?]

[Chorus]
Ou them young niggas set trippin'
Ou them young niggas set trippin'
I hit it from the back now she wet drippin'
I hop out the van with the vests in it
I hop out the van with the bands in
I hop out the van start dancing
The diamonds on my wrist are dancin'
The diamonds on your bitch are dancin'
Ou that bitch so scandalous
And the feds say my warrants outstanding
And a nigga took my swag and they ran with it
But the nigga took my swag can't handle it
Anything goes
Anything goes
Anything goes
Anything goes
Anything goes
Anything goes
Anything goes
Anything goes
Anything goes

[Verse 1]
Gone with the wind
Gone away cooking
Take a nigga shit when a nigga ain't looking
It really ain't take cause cold hard stealin'
Alone with today, cause you how I'm doin'
Down on my luck you know how I'm feelin'
You know where I'm from, you know how I'm livin'
It really ain't stealing cause of cold blood robbin'
A nigga drug dealing cause there's no more jobs
Four more cars on the day before [?] , with no garage, imma go hard
Anything goes when a nigga on trial
Anything goes when a nigga on style
Nigga on fire
Nigga on trial
Nigga ion lie
Nigga gon' die
Nigga on fire
Nigga on fire
Nigga on fire

[Chorus]
Ou them young niggas set trippin'
Ou them young niggas set trippin'
I hit it from the back now she wet drippin'
I hop out the van with the vests in it
I hop out the van with the bands in
I hop out the van start dancing
The diamonds on my wrist are dancin'
The diamonds on your bitch are dancin'
Ou that bitch so scandalous
And the feds say my warrants outstanding
And a nigga took my swag and they ran with it
But the nigga took my swag can't handle it
Anything goes
Anything goes
Anything goes
Anything goes
Anything goes
Anything goes
Anything goes
Anything goes
Anything goes

[Verse 2]
Fall down floor
Nigga playing dirty
Work, the work
Nigga wanna [?]
Nigga tryna swerve
Nigga is a bird
Nigga gettin' robbed tomorrow ,the early
Nigga gettin' bought out the block
Nigga gettin' [?] shot
Nigga at the Bob Ross shop
They goin' blah blah da
Nigga on [?]
Nigga on [?]
Nigga gonna dive out there
Keep it real, on the damn job out there
Keep it real nigga, go live out there
Keep it real nigga, on the G-code we abide by that
Catch me out side nigga, how 'bout that

[Bridge]
I'll know some, the way it goes
I'll let you go through, and down fall
Stay down, stay focused
Don't let them notice
And if they turn on
At least you know they roll
They roll

[Chorus]
Ou them young niggas set trippin'
Ou them young niggas set trippin'
I hit it from the back now she wet drippin'
I hop out the van with the vests in it
I hop out the van with the bands in
I hop out the van start dancing
The diamonds on my wrist are dancin'
The diamonds on your bitch are dancin'
Ou that bitch so scandalous
And the feds say my warrants outstanding
And a nigga took my swag and they ran with it
But the nigga took my swag can't handle it
Anything goes
Anything goes
Anything goes
Anything goes
Anything goes
Anything goes
Anything goes
Anything goes
Anything goes
