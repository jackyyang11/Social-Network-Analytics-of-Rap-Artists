[Hook: Yung Gleesh]
Grams, grams, grams
Grams, grams
Hit it with the morphine base and stretch it
Extra grams, my nigga Chuck bless 'em
Grams, grams, grams
Grams, grams, grams
Grams, grams, grams
Grams, grams

[Verse 1: Yung Gleesh]
Damn man, came from Amsterdam
Tryna fuckin' stretch all them grams
Extra grams I move to Nevirapine
All these extra pounds, I need some hands
Tranxene, put some extra bandz
Gleechie got them battle of the bandz
Twenty bandz fillin' out my pants
Then I'm chargin' sixty to the grams
With the dog
Four-five chopper hittin' walls
Knock a nigga dick in the dirt
Extra grams, I mix it with the dirt
How the good grams get mixed with the dirt?
Had a clean Sprite, but now it's dirt
Shawty keep ridin' with that expensive ass shit
I hope that nigga gun fuckin' work

[Hook: Yung Gleesh]
Grams, grams, grams
Grams, grams
Hit it with the morphine base and stretch it
Extra grams, my nigga Chuck bless 'em
Grams, grams, grams
Grams, grams, grams
Grams, grams, grams
Grams, grams

[Verse 2: Chuck]
Hit it with that morphine base and stretch it
Add a lil' quad, now make it catch it
All my dope be movin' 'cause I bless it
Think my grams ain't A1, come and test it
All my patients love me, I give blessings
All we do is move work and whole weapons
If you not know Chuck, believe this message
'Cause Keezy have you layin' in front them reverends
What niggas be hatin' on us 'cause they know we bout it and gettin' this money
I'm flexin' for grams, all on the 'Gram, then clowns start actin' all funny
Don't play with my work, don't play with my team and really don't play with my money
Don't make just load up them choppers
Say Keezy then hit you with twenty
But me gettin' paper and seein' my fam is a young nigga faith
And me movin' so many grams a week got a nigga gainin' weight
You one that left the shore for real, now you niggas is late
And I'ma keep countin' bandz my nigga while you broke niggas hate

[Hook: Yung Gleesh]
Grams, grams, grams
Grams, grams
Hit it with the morphine base and stretch it
Extra grams, my nigga Chuck bless 'em
Grams, grams, grams
Grams, grams, grams
