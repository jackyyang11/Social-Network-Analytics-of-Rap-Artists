[Intro]

What the fuck you know about what I need on my mind, motherfucker? My name was on the street? When we bounce from this shit here, y'all going to go down on them corners and let the people know: Word did not get back to me. Let them know Marlo step to any motherfucker -- Omar, Barksdale, whoever. My name is my name!

[Verse 1: Ab Liva]
Yeah, I never fronted
Shit we men of honour
Nigga in that order
What I said I done it
Art of War; Read up on it
Any corner; Set up on it
Push it till' the wheel dries
Never did I let up on it
Hustle my prerogative, Bobby Brown
Every little step I take
Got a nigga closer to say I run it
Hop on it
?Cargo 12 valve? with no tops on it
Rock on it
All eyes on me you think Pac's on it
Chrome kitted
Haters hypnotized just like Big did it
?Trump? like Escobar
?Lanta throw them bows with it?
Nine pound, drivin' off
Loose ends, tie 'em up
Richmond, DC, B-More then flyin' off?
Buying soft
Put it over flames then it's dryin' off
I been on my Marlo
Ever since the wires off
Now I'm The Source, Last of Mohicans
I speak it
Real nigga's know you just try it on
You just lyin on
I'm an iron horse, Pegasus
You can see my wings
See me flying off
I'm just buying lofts
See cause I'm a boss
Diddy won't stop till you hatin' niggas dyin' off

[Bridge]

[Verse 2: iCan]

Got The Wire transfer
Yes sir I came like Avon
