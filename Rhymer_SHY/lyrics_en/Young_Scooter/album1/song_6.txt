[Hook - 2x's]
I got niggas down the road
Waiting on an appeal
Living life through a pen
I hope they get that appeal
I hope they get that appeal

[Verse 1]
I just opened up the mailbox
Four letters from my niggas
Who fucked-up in the system
Who got they head up with no max date
Just to add them niggas to the state
Don't give a fuck who life they take away
You get cha time and they just walk away
Now you riding in that dirt lane
Shackled in chains
'Bout some petty change
That's what folks say
Cause you thinking about cha kids
And they ain't got a thang

[Hook - 2x's]

[Verse 2]
John Gotti did his time
A street nigga told on him
Alpo, he doing his time
A street nigga told on him
Guy Fisher did his time
A street nigga told on him
Big Meechie doing his time
A street nigga told on him
In the streets, you don't wanna get caught up
With them dope boy products
You gonna need a appeal
You gonna need a appeal
Only snitches get deals
Only snitches get deals

[Hook - 2x's]
