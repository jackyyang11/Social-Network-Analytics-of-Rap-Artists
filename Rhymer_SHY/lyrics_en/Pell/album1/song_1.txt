[Hook: Pell] (2x)
Ok now fill it up, ’93 supreme, we got gasoline
I should've stopped, but I need some wings, come and fly with me
Deja vu, it’s the same old scene, my life been a dream
And they can’t stop, what we meant to be, tell them c’est la vie

[Verse 1: Pell]
Never rolled the dice, but God knows I've been lucky
I never chose the Sprite, my exception is tonight
You never told a lie, so please don't say you love me
Just rumble this OG, and learn the lesson through the pipe
You don't want to feel no more, me too (me too)
Sprawling out on my floor, just lost the groove

[Hook: Pell] (2x)
Ok now fill it up, ’93 supreme, we got gasoline
I should've stopped, but I need some wings, come and fly with me
Deja vu, it’s the same old scene, my life been a dream
And they can’t stop, what we meant to be, tell them c’est la vie

[Verse 2: Pell]
Never rolled the dice, but know you want to fuck me
So cut off all the lights and illuminate the night
'Rillos rolled tight, so let's enjoy the sticky
I hit as you like, my objective ain't to slide
Confident but immature, can't run, from the truth
That ever since I took you home, we're lost to the groove

[Hook: Pell] (2x)
Ok now fill it up, ’93 supreme, we got gasoline
I should've stopped, but I need some wings, come and fly with me
Deja vu, it’s the same old scene, my life been a dream
And they can’t stop, what we meant to be, tell them c’est la vie

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh woah
Oh, oh, oh
Oh woah
Oh, oh, oh
Oh woah
Oh, oh, oh
