[Verse 1]
I waded in, then started swimming
Rolling so deep I'm defying limits
Side eyes from the guys tryna cuff they women
But I don't want your girl brother I'm too ambitious
I could share my towel with ya girl right now
I got a barracuda that could fit in her Bermuda
Probably leave her strung out on my young frank Lucas
But something smells fishy and the waters full of groupers
They saying you my Pell don't forget me, get me
But they never took the time to find a nigga history, is he that bad??
Nah not really
I just know my worth,  and a shone ain't worth a penny
But some be too fine, they make me think twice, like really think twice, like they could be mine
But I'm kidding, there's too many fish, and I'm tryna go swimming

[Hook]
Never bring sand to the beach, when you never even seen that shore
There's plenty more fish in the sea, so why would I swim with yours
I tell her what it is, she respect it because it's me, and I'ma swim in it talking ten feet deep
Ain't nobody gotta know, we just keep it low-key
But if they ask if that's me, I look back like
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Ma I get it in, but never been a player
Fisherman Pell so sometimes I just filet em
Keep em guessing where I’m staying unless they known the kid from day one
Taking slim bait leaving whales inside the ocean (I'm lying)
Jameson in my gills got me drunk in love
But it Only last a minute or until I bust
16 when my uncle took me fishing, but little did I know id hook the prettiest of women (for real)
Now I'm in my twenties and my lines the cause of interest
Now I'm tossing shells at my fucking competition
Saving sand dollars just to throw em at the women
Definition of a feel good living
In the waves all night
I could stay all night
Just for one my type
But until I find her I'm a keep swimming

[Hook]
Never bring sand to the beach, when you never even seen that shore
There's plenty more fish in the sea, so why would I swim with yours
I tell her what it is, she respect it because it's me, and I'ma swim in it talking ten feet deep
Ain't nobody gotta know, we just keep it low-key
But if they ask if that's me, I look back like
Yeah, yeah, yeah
