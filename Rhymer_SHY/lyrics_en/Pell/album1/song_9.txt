[Chorus: Pell]
I don't need much but I want it all, answer my phone when the money call
I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin
I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin
Need to get off of the internet, searching for something more intimate
I'm closing up all of the curtains, and hiding way under the surface
I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin
I'm Chirpin, Bitch
I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin
I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin
I'm Chirpin, Bitch
I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin
I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin
I'm Chirpin, Bitch
I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin
I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin
I'm Chirpin, Bitch
I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin

[Verse 1: Tarriona "Tank" Ball]
I like when they chirp back
Busy bee, buzzing me
Them Birds they like to chirp back
Them girls you gotta call back
Lay back, seat back, Sade and incense
Open minded highway, they end at the culdesac
Don't make me give you back to the hood
I wait for your play, like a good girl should, I’m hood
Phone stay chirpin', turn it off for focus let me
Redirect attention, meditating without television
Telescope, I scope the vision, no square or prisms
I’m different, my kitchen, keep a roller set like Shirley Chisholm
It's a cold world, oh lawd, haven’t you heard
I'm taking off like this bird, wait what?

[Chorus: Pell]
I don't need much but I want it all, answer my phone when the money call
I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin
I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin
Need to get off of the internet, searching for something more intimate
I'm closing up all of the curtains, and hiding way under the surface
I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin
I'm Chirpin, Bitch
I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin
I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin
I'm Chirpin, Bitch
I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin
I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin
I'm Chirpin, Bitch
I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin
I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin
I'm Chirpin, Bitch
I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin

[Verse 2: Pell]
Always been down to the asphalt
Not defined by what the cash bought
Mama still living in Jackson
But in Napa when the jet call
Advil for the jet lag, young Cam for the jetpack
Og cause he owe me, guess I should call it a gift wrap
Tryna move forward no zig zags, need a big bag I ain’t talking gas
I ain't got one of my own, but look at the game that's where my kids at
If ya from the NOLA, swear I wanna know ya
Without ya I’d feel blue, you know my feelings color coated
I’d ride for you, say a couple prayers at night for you
Saying that there’s nothing that I could do without you
And even since I went and changed my lease
Hit my line if you in need, New Orleans

[Chorus: Pell]
I don't need much but I want it all, answer my phone when the money call
I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin
I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin
Need to get off of the internet, searching for something more intimate
I'm closing up all of the curtains, and hiding way under the surface
I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin
I'm Chirpin, Bitch
I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin
I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin
I'm Chirpin, Bitch
I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin
I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin
I'm Chirpin, Bitch
I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin
I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin
I'm Chirpin, Bitch
I'm Chirpin I'm Chirpin

[Verse 3: Neno Calvin]
I’m on the syrup on Bourbon
I ain’t sloppy drunk but I’m shirtless
With a new bitch with no purpose
Imma fuck her good then I’m skirting
I be hustling hard on the first
I be hustling hard on the third
I be hustling hard with that work
I’m a good guy but live dirty
She a cute freak but she thirty
Imma make her love me for certain
If you choose to trust it might hurt you
Big backwood this a personal
On my block it’s just murder
On my block we just serving
On my block we don’t call cops we retaliate like soldiers
I’m the whole heart of that Nola
My whole heart in that Nola (aw aw)
I doze off when I’m loaded
I pop three when I’m bored
My dawg died got murdered
Every day nigga head hurting
Show tough love no mercy
On a good four of that potion
I woke up before them birds start chirping
I been stressing but I’m flexing you ain’t notice
I’ve been through some shit I know you can’t cope with
Don’t go questioning my thoughts stay focused
Yeah, why you doing me that?
My round just got a brick this week we almost through with that
I done made like sixty thousand, end up blowing that
Might go get a Nextel chirp and bring that movement back.. yeah
