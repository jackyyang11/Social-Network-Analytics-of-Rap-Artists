[Hook: Pell]
She keep saying young Pell, don't you forget me, get me
She keep on saying young Pell, don't you forget me, get me
I see you out here chasing dreams and you making history
Don't let them lights blind you motherfucker don't forget me
They keep on saying young Pell, don't you forget me, get me
They keep saying young Pell, don't you forget me, get me
I see you out here chasing dreams and you making history
Don't let them lights blind you motherfucker don't forget me

[Verse 1: Pell]
I woke up this morning thinking about my dreams
Masking nightmares and the likes of which I've seen
Standing ovations for my raw imagine
Painting Ben Franklin's cause my fans say they relatin'
