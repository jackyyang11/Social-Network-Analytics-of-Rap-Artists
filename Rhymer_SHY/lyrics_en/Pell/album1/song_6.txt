[Verse 1: Pell]

"Eloquent" is your style, setting precedents
Your money tense, because you're wasting dead presidents
Thought that I was balling cause I bought you with my confidence
Would never hit you but I struck you with my compliments
You need clothes, I need hoes: so it's common sense
That I would buy your love, cheese all in your arteries
In exchange for a girl to call my main
The cats out the bag and both of us to blame
I'm packing up my things because you want to get away
You just want a ring but like Saturn I need space
Loading up my things then ignite the V8
Then I shift it down to drive
Now I'm on the highway

[Hook 1: Cole Humphries]

I don't see you crying
I hear you Laughin'
I want to be drivin'
Why is this happening?

[Verse 2: Pell]

Key in the ignition, driving to the finish
Destination space station, I'mma live with no limits
Paved my own lane, so you know I'm not switching
Linked with Hollywood Cole, now she thinks I'm acting different
Letting down my windows, feel the breeze when the wind hits
Enjoy the little things though we see the bigger picture
Looking at our past through my rearview mirror like, (Damn)
Look at all the shit we been through
Used to call me lame, now they dap me like we been cool
Educated and I'm patient but I've never been schooled
A rock that's never been moved
And half these dudes claiming that they are the truth
But its never been proved
You don't really see them cause you know what's best
You would never leave me cause the drive is what's next
On the sched', pass some green lights
Even run a couple reds, as we stretch to get ahead

[Bridge: Pell & Cole Humphries]

You, you come with me
We'll, we'll make history
I'm learning who I should be
But eventually we will be free

Hoping that you'd ride on this road called life
Keep up with my speed
As we move, move, move
Opening our eyes
Don't know what we'll find
But to be honest I just need a co-pilot
When the road gets rocky I'm going to keep on driving

[Hook 2: Cole Humphries]

Ocean waves, summer air
The water was splashin'
Living without a care
I've got some checks Ca$hin'
