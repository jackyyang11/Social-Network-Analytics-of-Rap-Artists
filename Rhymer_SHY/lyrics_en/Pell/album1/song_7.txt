[Verse 1]
Café du Monde on your T-shirt
In your hotel, you're a sweetheart
Mom works two jobs for your new shoes
Claiming you kept, but it ain't true
Who know your name, you're the cool kid
Claiming you slept with the new girl
But they don't know she's an angel
Trapped in the eye of a cruel world
Should've come clean, but you're too vain
Drinking till death to avoid pain
Hoping she's fine but you won't ever call
Now she went up river flow then far away
Just so you can never see her face again
Oh man

[Hook]
Stuck in the web of your lies
You look in your soul
You dance in the light
But you can tell it ain't cold
So tell me what is the price for all of the world
When karma catch up
And holds you true to your word
To gather fate is when you know you should've climbed
Scatter the pieces of the frame you are inside

[Verse 2]
Coco Chanel number five
I smell petty in your future
Left those croissants in the old world
With your old man, he a loser
Just called to say your goodbye
Hang up that line, for it's too much
You got a flight in the morning
Start a new life in the morning
Ring is for sure so you keep it
Cash out you life, who you leaving?
You ain't got time to waste
When you're getting old
And that grass looks greener from the other side
But once you flee the scene
You fiend forgotten times that ain't coming back

[Hook]
Stuck in the web of your lies
You look in your soul
You dance in the light
But you can tell it ain't cold
So tell me what is the price for all of the world
When karma catch up
And holds you true to your word
To gather fate is when you know you should've climbed
Scatter the pieces of the frame you are inside

[Bridge]
Mm na na
Mm na na
Mm na na na na
Mm na na
Mm na na
Mm na na na na
Rolling too deep
Watch where you sleep
They coming for you
With nothing to lose
Death they call harm
Enlaced with loss
Till you're caught up

[Hook]
Stuck in the web of your lies
You look in your soul
You dance in the light
But you can tell it ain't cold
So tell me what is the price for all of the world
When karma catch up
And holds you true to your word
To gather fate is when you know you should've climbed
Scatter the pieces of the frame you are inside
