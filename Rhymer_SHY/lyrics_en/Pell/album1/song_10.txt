[Verse 1: Pell]
Dammit straight it, I’m appreciated
But still underrated
I got girls all in they feelings
Might just send them on vacation
Man you know who got the juice
Ain’t no need to check your pantry
You know I play the perfect hand
Still I had to up the ante
I was in the plain pits, dog, like, “where the album sales?”
Shit, I know damn well, ‘cause I went AWOL
Nation on my back, least that’s what my people tell me
No mistaking, can’t avoid it, but it looks so damn healthy
Partners blowing KK, should pay us for a selfie
Make you sing like Ray J, hit it first and then come tell me
Mama worried if I’m happy, ‘cause I just turned off my celly’s
Take a car ride after business, ‘cause some broad just hit the telly
Know I’m in (Wooh!), know I’m fucking in it
Having problems with commitments, I was spiteful when I did it
I admit it, but my honesty don’t mean that I could fix it
Gon’ pop a few for pimp, or at least the G’s that’s with me

[Hook: Pell]
Man I swore I wouldn’t stunt, swore I wouldn’t stunt, swore I wouldn’t stunt
Swore I wouldn’t stunt, swore I wouldn’t stunt, swore I wouldn’t stunt
Swore I wouldn’t stunt, swore I wouldn’t stunt, swore I wouldn’t stunt
I could say I’m sorry, but I can’t tell a lie
Man I swore I wouldn’t stunt, swore I wouldn’t stunt, swore I wouldn’t stunt
Swore I wouldn’t stunt, swore I wouldn’t stunt, swore I wouldn’t stunt
Swore I wouldn’t stunt, swore I wouldn’t stunt, swore I wouldn’t stunt
I’ve been feeling awesome, living on a high

[Verse 2: Pell]
I would say I’m sorry, but I can’t tell a lie
I’ve been feeling awesome, living on a high
You say that you feel me, let me ask you why
‘Cause you don’t really know me, you just know I stick to the code
London calling with the cake, we at birthdays
Still got real ones by my side, on my worst days
Pick a shone for Brody, he met her on third base
Got holy water in our boxes if she thirsty
Running this here, till I’m out of options
Fuck a double entendre, I’m a mother fucking monster
After going to your CD release, surprised you dropped it
Thought you was fly as a cockpit, you plummet before you profit
"Who the man?” Do I even got to ask myself
I was tired of being broke I had to cash myself
Got a flow that’s so dope, I can cash myself
Hit the mall and buy it all, so I could act myself

[Hook: Pell]
Man I swore I wouldn’t stunt, swore I wouldn’t stunt, swore I wouldn’t stunt
Swore I wouldn’t stunt, swore I wouldn’t stunt, swore I wouldn’t stunt
Swore I wouldn’t stunt, swore I wouldn’t stunt, swore I wouldn’t stunt
I would say I’m sorry, but I can’t tell a lie
Man I swore I wouldn’t stunt, swore I wouldn’t stunt, swore I wouldn’t stunt
Swore I wouldn’t stunt, swore I wouldn’t stunt, swore I wouldn’t stunt
Swore I wouldn’t stunt, swore I wouldn’t stunt, swore I wouldn’t stunt
I’ve been feeling awesome, living on a high
