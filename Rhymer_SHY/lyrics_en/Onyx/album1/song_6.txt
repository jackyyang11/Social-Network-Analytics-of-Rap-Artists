[Sonsee]
Over here, and bust the way, crush a sucka gutter
Sun don't cease at a hundred degrees I'm coolin in your freezer
(He's a breezer) I hits it up with that bald faced rap
I sinks to the crack, and I make shit get wild
Run it by, bust to start, to punch, others front
Top drop Ceasar, it's more than a leisure
Bitch every fuckin grain in your brain, like a tweezer
The sinister thief, shaded to 6 feet deep
For the misdemeanor, offender, the backbender (UH)
Corny nigga, the bullshit trip ender (YEAH)
Never perpetratin, so ain't no lurkin in the dark
I'm lurkin near the workin niggas heart
Used to be a gambler, when I was a scrambler
Now I'm grand to her, shorty back might damage her
Who's this here, state my facts, and react
And saturate brains with a plate of hot wax
Intertwining, combining and aligning, shining, studies
In the light right now while we wreak fuckin havoc!

[Fredo Starr]
Come inside with his highness, the illinest
Killin em with adrenalin, blast past the minimum
Look to the winter's ugliness, ruggedness
Under the rug, front to this, money strikes confidence
Chopped in the days and the blazin smell
Then the realm of a seance, I blackloose, guns!
Comin to the project, walls with AKs
We're talkin days, word, that you sun
You really want some next shit, some blood on the exit?
Watch me wreck shit as they exit
But yo I keep em hollerin, screamin out for mercy
Minds of a lowest of enemies, ghetto mentality
So blast it as I hit your head you're dead not disbelievin
Got the toxic rock, to bring a nigga Biohazard!

[Sticky Fingaz]
I swear to fuckin God I raise Hell and make the white man call me MASTER
I'm 666, and need to repent to the pastor
SO FUCK THE RADIO and close your ears but read my lips I rips
And if you eat my words I'll leave your strung like umm (UMM, UMMMHH!!)
It was on the tip of my tongue!
But now it's stuck in between my throat
I can't breath so I lick it
Onyx ain't the top pick, you must be suckin a black dick
And if it takes the death of me, to make history
The whole world will remember my misery
I know what I'm tryin to say my words get in the way
They render me speechless, ohh Black Jesus I'm cryin inside
Couldn't give a FUCK if I live or die
Cause I'm just a slave who's brave (uh-huh)
But fuck pickin cotton, I'd rather see my grave, so I
Meditated, before I was created
And if you prefer sorrow, made me reincarnated
Now I'm back rulin MC's but pussy niggas increase
Well then it's just another nigga that, gotta get greased
So if you wanna talk shit, in order to avoid a fight
Say what the fuck you wanna say, just spell my name right
