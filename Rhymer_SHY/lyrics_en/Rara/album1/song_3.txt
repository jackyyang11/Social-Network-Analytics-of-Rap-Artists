[Verse 1: Rara]
Dear summer, can a nigga come up?
Can you promise me that I'd never fumble?
Can you send a [??], send some bitches?
Can you send a plug with a [??]?
Can you bless a nigga with a condo at the top?
With a city view, [??] a nigga through
Let a nigga eat, let a player play
Let a gangster have his motherfucking way
I got some issues that I need to solve, quick
I done fuck around and fell in love with this spoiled bitch
I'm tryna have it, I gotta have it
I need Margiella, Balencias and [??]
I need some coke from Miami, a Benz outta [??], a attic, these streets turned me savage
I gotta [??] for this shit, I'm ready for this shit
[??] niggas in fed who'd have [??] for this shit
My [??] for this shit
I'm hoping in bed with this bitch
Fuck da world, I fuck 'em good
Shit comes with this, hope its understood
I need some dough , get me out da hood
I need a lick, have me straight for good, ya

[Hook: RaRa]
Stayed on the grind (Ya)
And came from behind (You Know)
Now its our time, our stars align
Won't fumble no more
The whole team on go
My squad the show
Now all these hoes know
I just wanna shine, I just wanna shine
I just wanna shine, I just wanna shine
Came up from behind, going on a grind
Now I'm there, wanna shine, let a nigga shine

[Bridge: RaRa]
I just wanna hit the fucking club and throw some bands up
Tell a stripper bad bitch to get some head up
Drop a hoe back on a Porsche, now we speed up
Tell my niggas in the hood to keep they head up
I just wanna shine

[Verse 2: RaRa]
[??] some, can I shine with ya?
Vibe with ya, can we [??]?
Get  my shit in order, take it to the water
Can I lay on the beach with somebody daughter
Go to [??], go to DOA, go to KOD, got some room for me
Can I pull a lamb up, the club lit, get some [??] for us to chill
I need some [??] please, under palm trees
And my neck jealous of my wrist freeze
Want a jet-ski, want a pent lease
I can get it all off the coca leaves
Top drop, riding sunset, with a Puerto-Rican  and a freak
Hit the Louis store [??] Melrose, have a nigga fresher than a [??]
Bitches creeping for the weekend
Live for the moment, this on my [??], we on it
Look at my eye, see, I want it, I'm on it, I'm crushing and busting that [??]
Summer coming, niggas staying, send in some, let's get it [??]
On top of money, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday, we going straight to that money

[Hook: RaRa]
Stayed on the grind (Ya)
And came from behind (You Know)
Now its our time, our stars align
Won't fumble no more
The whole team on go
My squad the show
Now all these hoes know
I just wanna shine, I just wanna shine
I just wanna shine, I just wanna shine
Came up from behind, going on a grind
Now I'm there, wanna shine, let a nigga shine

[Bridge: RaRa]
I just wanna hit the fucking club and throw some bands up
Tell a stripper bad bitch to get some head up
Drop a hoe back on a Porsche, now we speed up
Tell my niggas in the hood to keep they head up
I just wanna shine

[Outro: RaRa]
I just wanna shine
I just wanna shine
I just wanna shine
I just wanna shine
I just wanna shine
