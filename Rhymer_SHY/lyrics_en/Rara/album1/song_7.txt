[Verse 1: RaRa]
Chasin' the money like it got legs
I'm tryna camouflage from the feds
I need a big booty and some bread
I need some scrambled eggs and some head
Smokin' a cigarette inside the foreign
Goin' on police chases when it's borin'
Ghetto bitches see a niggas and go in
Fuck with my pimp and she know that I'm on

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Goin' on, yeah, your hoe whorin'
Should be long gone, get you gone
In the all chrome, my new whip
Goin' real fast, gettin' slow dome
For a long time been I been well-known
Pull a bad broad like pheromone
I gotta thank God for this taramone
'Cause I been tryna rob for a Herringbone

[Verse 3: RaRa]
I'm on Melrose
Got the fetty for it, know I'm ready for it
Ridin' drop top, bitch, I'm headed for it
Couch steady for it
I'ma shake this, I look great, bitch
Clean your plate, bitch, fix your face, bitch
Call your girl up, fuck her world up
Baby girl up, things they tell us
Sheets they sellin', I'ma sell her

[Verse 4: T.I.]
My mama need me and I won't fail her
When she need somethin', what you think I'm gon' tell her
Even the mid-strap and my Kevlar
Know we just set raw, we don't steal cars
We don't take shit, we go ape shit
Get you crossed out like my shoe laces
Nigga, learned the basics 'fore you try to step up
I'll die before I let you disrespect her, yessir
Quarter mill in the Tesla, gas her up
Had a whip should out of pressure, yessir
The chopper come with me wherever I go
And I pop big shit, hand on the Bible
Hand on rifle, make me pipe up
You new niggas ain't shit like us
Ain't that none of the shit you write up
They ought to disqualify your cypher
My best friends are real deal lifers
Who ran these streets and earned these stripes, bruh
I earned my right to kick this shit, man
Man, I done dodged these bullets and did this shit
I been in and out of prison since 'bout 15
Ain't nothin' soft about this king
And ain't nothin' weak about this clique
And we'll see if you really about this shit
We spendin' old dope money with a brand new stick
Got the blueprint and the manuscript
The need to cross that line, the man you handle
Whatever you do, do not do that

[Verse 5: RaRa]
Big ol' bag, big ol' ass, big ol' knot, big ol' rock, we on top
Diddy bop, can't stop, won't stop, serve the hood, move the block
Shake the cops, don't panic, came to win, it's not a trend, I'm all in
I replace the shit, Harlem Shake the shit
Put it back together, I remake this shit
We can make this shit, no more basic shit
Police hate this shit, start that racist shit
Come and case the bitch, come back, take some shit
Your little safe house is not that safe and shit
On that Hen', I don't chase just face shit
Draw these guidelines and you just trace that shit
I got pull dog and I showcase the shit
Put my game down and she embrace that shit

[Verse 6: T.I.]
You got me sadly mistaken, you got me fucked up
Wanna form a line waitin' for me to pick my tux up
With a new bow tie, I handle my business, fly off the handle, I
Been major ever since was independent
Nigga better recognize a prince decended
Nigga started in the trap and did transcend it
Again and again and again, I did it

[Verse 7: RaRa]
Money, set, drugs, fam' first
Beamer, Benz, and Bentley, not a verb
Bitch, you wanna see me, bring your purse
Make it worth a mil and get to work
Hustle Gang with you, yes for sure
Pistol on you with you, yes for sure
Never been a sucker, that's for sure
Die for what I rhyme for, for sure

[Verse 8: T.I.]
Nigga, always got some shit to say about it
If I did get it, feel the way about it
What they ought to do, do a article
Wanna diss niggas in your interview
Goin' back and forth ain't what I'm finna do
'Cause my attitude is too cynical
Take your main bitch, hit her with full dick
Put her ass to sleep like Benadryl
Or a Lortab, wake her ass up
Hit her bathroom, take a whore bath
I'm not fazed 'bout what thots say
Don't give no damn 'bout a whore wrath
If a porno or a pure dab
Been to your pad, where's your cab?
I'm a revolutionary radical
Need pussy just to take me off the war path
I see sunny days in my forecast
Homie, you don't pay, well it's your ass
You be goin' home with a tore ass
With some bullet holes in your torso
Need a fork lift for my bankrolls
While I'm kickin' back and drinkin' Bordeaux
While a nigga kickin' in your door
Hold up, wait a minute, there's more dough

[Verse 9: RaRa]
Ric Flair, got it poppin' like Ric Flair
Rich boy, cold, bitch please
Bitch, sneeze, we'll bless ya, we're special
Yeah, extra, extra, read about it, bitch
You don't like it, see about it, bitch
Forever I'ma be about it, bitch
Always hate on me about it, bitch
Tip found me, I was out here thuggin'
Nigga tried me, I be out here bustin'
12 behind me, I'm out here flushin'
Got too many guns to be out here testin'
Aw man, I am such a player, tryna find another me is rare
Me and your bitch get your bitch here
Won't be spared, don't get scared
We don't love her, we just kinda like her
Pass her to the homie, we recycle
I am somethin' like a young Michael, Tyson, Jordan, Jackson
Dope boy, GQ special, real nigga, bad bitch issue
Redbone, centrefold hoe, banks sellin' bricks and goin' gold
Ya know it
