[Verse 1]
Sup man, Let dem boys thru, Ya know it!
Rap niggas bebop, Street niggas rerock
Pull up in dem big block drops, Dey love wen we pop(Man)
Renegade and rental cars, Dodging penitentiary bars
Jesus piece ta hide my flaws, Tryn ta leave behind a life of crime
Judge trying to give us time, But right now we don’t have the time
Don’t understand ya never will, I chop the dope I work da wheel
Razor blade Ra, Outlaw, Beat da dope soufpaw
Young boss my word law, I’m dat raw(Pimp)
Bitches work da chickens, Tripple digits in da kitchen
Seen a milli thru da vision, Bitches coola den a frigidaire
Lay dem niggas down like babyhair, You know slum braided there wen you see dat Mercedes there (Coupe nigga)
None of da cars we ride, None of um got roofs nigga
All da hoes dat come wit us, Came da get loose nigga
Slum paquiao dey thank im on da juice nigga, Do serve a deuce livn proof I’m da truth nigga!

[Chorus]
Roll my sleeves up, hit the rays and go crazy
Sip so much lean today I went crazy
Strapped up guardin' them babies, they think I'm crazy
Seen the dope money on the table, she went crazy
Ridin' 'round with all that blow, boy you crazy
Stickin' dick in all these hoes, boy you crazy
Just bought a brand new whip, that bitch crazy
Seen you last night at the club, you went crazy
Yeah man, goin' goin' down
Crazy, shit crazy

[Verse 2]
Hoe’s lined up at da whip, Like dey tryn ta get inside it(Uh)
I brought out all da chainz, Like I’m tryn get indicted(Uh)Ya know it!
Get a whole thang, Split it down and divide it
Gangsta party at da mansion, Pussy nigga ya not invited(Man)
Slum sip Coronas wit stonaz, And work conaz
Post up at da store, In front of 12, Wit dope on us
Dis is how we kick it, Exstindo hangn out r Britches
Seen a hunit dolla luis belt, Somebody call da Luis rep
Rain wit da limo tent, Dey Be like slum dat u in there
Walk in magic fuck it up, Don’t give fuck bout who in there

[Chorus]
Roll my sleeves up, hit the rays and go crazy
Sip so much lean today I went crazy
Strapped up guardin' them babies, they think I'm crazy
Seen the dope money on the table, she went crazy
Ridin' 'round with all that blow, boy you crazy
Stickin' dick in all these hoes, boy you crazy
Just bought a brand new whip, that bitch crazy
Seen you last night at the club, you went crazy
Yeah man, goin' goin' down
