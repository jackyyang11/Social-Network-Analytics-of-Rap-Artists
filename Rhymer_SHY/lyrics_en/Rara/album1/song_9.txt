Young Capone Holla at the people

[Young Capone:]
Now please pardon my french cause i dont mean to be rude
But its so much that i take these pussy niggas to school
And act a fool if they think of disrespecting the team
Pop the trunk get the gat and introduce them to the beam
Best believe every nigga in the squad got a strap
Keep the chooper in the trunk and the gats in the lap
Fuck around and get clapped for poppin at the trap
Real niggas hold it down pussy niggas get slapped
Tryin to give a nigga dap but kick a hater
Move aside jesus and his squad im the muthafuckin truth
Treeruff is too i dumpin at you booth
Befor i leave this muthafucka imma teach u bout the dude

See you a lame (You a lame)

And i dont hang around no muthafuckin bustas (No muthafuckin bustas)
I keep it real (I keep it real)
Cause im a G (Cause im a G)
And i ain't wit niggas that scream MP (MP!)

[Daz:]
Look in the eyes of a young g hustling for the future
Duck and drive by let them so so (?)
Duking it out load up them choppers ghetto birds helicopters squad cars
You know we living that dog pound (we living like usual)
You trip nigga (POW POW)
Thats wat we do to you
Tory (?) smoking the blunt of the fire
You see we won't stop stop sttill we retire
Get it higher higher levitate it up in the air
So you better be ready for a crew yellin "We dont care!"
So get what you suposed to meet us in the parking lot
Bring ya gloves wit plenty blunts
Cause we like starting (?)
