[Verse 1: RaRa]
On a mission tryna come up
Need to get paperwork to come in
Niggas eat, man I just want in
Praying throughout my journey, me and this money gon' have a run in
Got a long list that run on
Thing I wanted so long
I put in time for this, grind for this, stood in line for this, changed my frame of mind for this
[??] blind for this
I'm patient for it, waiting for it
On a stake out, me and Nike at the steak home
Me and this money bout to make out
Politics as usual
I just home the feelings mutual
I'm just tryna flood the mula
VVS connoisseur
Where dat money, call dat bih
Tell her that I'm coming to her
Tell her I'm arriving soon
Me and her can get a room
I dream a safe deposit, filled up
Walk-in closet, filled up
Houses on the hill, built from [??] up
This money heal us
This game [??]
I learnt a lot of [??], that shit never be forgotten

[Hook: RaRa]
I know you answer prayers
I got some niggas sitting in jail, can you answer theirs?
I got some niggas got here starving, they need help as well
Road to riches round the corner show us to the trap
White tux, bow ties with the black lapel
[??] will we make it, only time will tell
Not gettin in and gettin dirty, only way we fail
Tryna prevail in the cell in these streets of hell

[Verse 2: RaRa]
[??] bring plenty hope
A brick a boy can bring plenty joy
Can right players set the right mood
I can be bigger with the right tunes
I'm in the field tryna win a picture
On the phone, told my landlord, I need a little extension
Rent due, got some venue, tryna get into
Bent through, streaming [??], so did what I do
Get up every morning hustlin'
Shit shave shower hustle
Hustle and some more hustle
Only thang I know is hustle
I [??] my life for it
Stay up all night for it
They don't wanna get to me
I'm prepared to fight for it
Scheme so much, I dream so much
I don't get much sleep, that's prolly why I'm on that lean so much
Stressing cus' I seen so much
I need more
Fuck it, I need more
I got places I gotta go, I'ma let you on
Niggas dream of having jewels like Slick Rick
Scratching off a quick pick, niggas in my hood ain't it picket fences having picnics
Only picture niggas on the corner tryna get rich
And I was down with dem
Police pull us over, I be on the ground with them

[Hook: RaRa]
I know you answer prayers
I got some niggas sitting in jail, can you answer theirs?
I got some niggas got here starving, they need help as well
Road to riches round the corner show us to the trap
White tux, bow ties with the black lapel
[??] will we make it, only time will tell
Not gettin in and gettin dirty, only way we fail
Tryna prevail in the cell in these streets of hell
