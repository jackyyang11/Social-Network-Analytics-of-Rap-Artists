[Intro]
(Cululoo, cululoo)
(Cululoo, cululoo)
(Cululoo, cululoo)
(Cululoo, cululoo)
I'm not your toy (Cululoo, cululoo)
I'm not your (Cululoo, cululoo)
La (Cululoo, cululoo)
I'm not your (Cululoo, cululoo)

[Chorus 1]
I'm not your toy (Not your toy)
You stupid boy  (Stupid boy)
I'll take you down now, make you watch
We're dancing with my dolls on the motha-bucka beat
(Hey!)
(Hey!)
(Hey!)

[Verse 1]
Look at me, I'm a beautiful creature
I don't care about your "modern time preacherss"
Welcome boys, too much noise, I will teach ya
Hey, I think you forgot how to play
My teddy bear's running away
The Barbie got something to say, hey, hey, hey
Hey! My "Simon says" leave me alone
I'm taking my Pikachu home
You're stupid just like your smartphone

[Pre-Chorus]
Wonder Woman don't you ever forget
You're divine and he's about to regret
Wonder Woman don't you ever forget
You're divine and he's about to regret

[Verse 2]
(Cululoo, cululoo) Wedding bells ringing
(Cululoo, cululoo) Money men bling-bling
I don't care about your stefa, baby

[Chorus 1]
I'm not your toy (Not your toy)
You stupid boy  (Stupid boy)
I'll take you down now, make you watch
We're dancing with my dolls on the motha-bucka beat
I'm not your toy (Not your toy)
You stupid boy  (Stupid boy)

[Bridge]
I'll t-t-t-take you now
W-w-w-with me now, boy

[Chorus 2]
(I'm not your toy)
(You stupid boy)
(I'm not your toy)
(You stupid boy)
I'll take you down now, make you watch
We're dancing with my dolls on the motha-bucka beat
(I'm not your toy)

[Outro]
(I'm not your toy) Look at me, I'm a beautiful creature
(You stupid boy) I don't care about your "modern time preachers"
(I'm not your toy) Not your toy, not your toy, not your toy, toy
I'm not your toy, not your toy, not your toy, toy
