[Verse 1]
Look at me, I'm a beautiful creature
I don't care about your modern-time preachers
Welcome boys, too much noise, I will teach ya
Pam pam pa hoo, prram pam pa hoo
Hey, I think you forgot how to play
My teddy bear's running away
The Barbie got somethin' to say, hey, hey, hey
Hey! My "Simon says" leave me alone
I'm taking my Pikachu home
You're stupid just like your smartphone

[Pre-Chorus]
Wonder Woman don't you ever forget
You're divine and he's about to regret
He's a baka-mhm-bak-mhm-bakbak-bak-mhm-boy
Baka-mhm-bak-mhm-bakbak
I'm not your baka-mhm-bak-mhm-bak-mhm-bak-mhm-bak-mhm...

[Chorus]
I'm not your toy, not your toy
You stupid boy, stupid boy
I'll take you down now, make you watch me
Dancing with my dolls on the motha-bucka beat
Not your toy (cululoo, cululoo)
(Cululoo, cululoo)

[Verse 2]
A-A-A-Ani lo buba
Don't you go and play with me, boy
A-A-A-Ani lo buba
Don't you go and play, shake!
(Cululoo, cululoo) Wedding bells ringing
(Cululoo, cululoo) Money man bling-bling
I don't care about your stefa, baby
Pam pam pa hoo, prram pam pa hoo

[Pre-Chorus]
Wonder Woman don't you ever forget
You're divine and he's about to regret
He's a baka-mhm-bak-mhm-bakbak-bak-mhm-boy
Baka-mhm-bak-mhm-bakbak
I'm not your baka-mhm-bak-mhm-bak-mhm-bak-mhm-bak-mhm...

[Chorus]
I'm not your toy, not your toy
You stupid boy, stupid boy
I'll take you down now, make you watch me
Dancing with my dolls on the motha-bucka beat

[Bridge]
I'll t-t-t-take you now
W-w-w-with me
Now, boy

[Chorus]
I'm not your toy
You stupid boy
I'll take you down now, make you watch me
Dancing with my dolls on the motha-bucka beat

[Outro]
(I'm not your toy) Look at me, I'm a beautiful creature
(You stupid boy) I don't care about your modern-time preachers
I'm not your toy, not your toy, not your toy, not your toy, toy
I'm not your toy, not your toy, not your toy, toy
