[Chorus]
They just don't know 'bout love (oh oh, oh oh ah)
When they talk about us
When, when they talk about us
When, when they talk about us
They just don't know 'bout love (oh oh, oh oh ah)
They talk about us
They-they-they talk about us
They-they-they talk about us
They just don't know 'bout love

[Verse 1]
I've been everywhere around the world
But it don't seem the same if you're not there with me
My fancy cars draw so much attention
But without these diamond rings, I know you'll still care for me
My friends keep on tellin' me
I'm just wastin' my energy
I don't know what's gotten into me
I think they just don't know bout love
I've heard it all before

[Chorus]
They just don't know 'bout love (oh oh, oh oh ah)
When they talk about us
When, when they talk about us
When, when they talk about us
They just don't know 'bout love (oh oh, oh oh ah)
They talk about us
They-they-they talk about us
They-they-they talk about us
They just don't know 'bout love
It's why every time, you
Come around my way, you
Know just what to do
You know just what to say
You put me in my place
With a smile on my face
They just don't know bout love

[Verse 2:]
I've had my share of bad expensive girls
But I never let em go from my bed to my heart
You took a different route, made me wanna check you out
I doubt if you gon' let this fall apart
My friends keep on tellin' me
I'm just wastin' my energy
I don't know what's gotten into me
I think they just don't know bout love
I've heard it all before

[Chorus]
They just don't know 'bout love (oh oh, oh oh ah)
When they talk about us
When, when they talk about us
When, when they talk about us
They just don't know 'bout love (oh oh, oh oh ah)
They talk about us
They-they-they talk about us
They-they-they talk about us
They just don't know 'bout love
It's why every time, you
Come around my way, you
Know just what to do
You know just what to say
You put me in my place
With a smile on my face
They just don't know bout love

[Bridge]
We're the center of attention
No need to mention
You're the only sun that shines for me
Every dimension of you
Is worth the shit that I go through

[Chorus]
They just don't know 'bout love (oh oh, oh oh ah)
When they talk about us
When, when they talk about us
When, when they talk about us
They just don't know 'bout love (oh oh, oh oh ah)
They talk about us
They-they-they talk about us
They-they-they talk about us
They just don't know 'bout love
It's why every time, you
Come around my way, you
Know just what to do
You know just what to say
You put me in my place
With a smile on my face
They just don't know bout love
