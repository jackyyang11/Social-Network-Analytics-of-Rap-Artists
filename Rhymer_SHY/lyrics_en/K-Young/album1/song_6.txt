[Intro]
Nice to meet you, Mr. Freeze

[Chorus: K-Young]
You can catch me with a bag, shawty
In the back of the V.I.P
Follow me (ha)
Follow me (ha)
Follow me, follow the leader
Follow the leader
Follow the leader

[Verse 1: K-Young]
Haters sittin' outside, Rovers sittin' outside
They ain't fuckin' with me though
Diamonds glistenin' on mine
Hunnid thousand on mines
Diamonds all on my neck
All these flights on this check
All these hoes on my check
Got me like...
Free shots at the bar
Got all these bitches on me
Better keep yo' bitch up off me
[?]
Let me tell you somethin' that you know
Take you to Mars, no Bruno
Nigga, I'm the boss, now you know (you know)

[Hook: K-Young]
All this money I spent
Bet tonight you'll remember me
All this money I spent
Bet your girl gon' remember me

[Chorus: K-Young]
You can catch me with a bag, shawty
In the back of the V.I.P
Follow me (ha)
Follow me (ha)
Follow me, follow the leader
Follow the leader
Follow the leader

[Verse 2: Niqle Nut]
Follow the, follow the leader
I got this lean, I pour by the liter
I got a secret, don't think I can keep it
Spendin' a thousand, a thousand on sneakers
Hand me my engine, my engine you know
You should be givin' me pussy, you hoe
Reppin' my city, I live by the code
Married the game, we just now reload, yo
I be dressin' that Prada, my nigga
I just grabbed me some new [?]
Made Masion Margiela, nigga
Jeans all on my Gucci beanie
I'm gon' throw all of this cake
Niggas gon' hate, that's a [?] trait
You gettin' no money so you can't relate
My bitch be whippin' the quarter of 8, yeah
These niggas wearin' fake Louis
These niggas wearin' fake Gucci
Bought my bitch some Red Bottoms
Some fakew titties and a big booty
I'm Niqle

[Hook: K-Young]
All this money I spent
Bet tonight you'll remember me
All this money I spent
Bet your girl gon' remember me

[Chorus: K-Young]
You can catch me with a bag, shawty
In the back of the V.I.P
Follow me (ha)
Follow me (ha)
Follow me, follow the leader
Follow the leader
Follow the leader
