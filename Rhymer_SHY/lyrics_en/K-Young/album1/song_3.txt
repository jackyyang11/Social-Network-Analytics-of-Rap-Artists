(Verse)
It's dangerous how you make me feel
When my heartbeat gets to jumping, girl I know it's real
And your kisses
Shit! So damn ridiculous

(Pre-Chorus)
I can't forget about how you sex me down so good
I won't do you wrong
She be in my ear like baby

(Chorus)
Don't ever leave me no no
Don't ever leave me baby
Don't ever leave me no no
Don't ever leave me

(Verse)
Baby, don't you cry tonight, no
(no no no)
Let's make love under the moonlight
Tryna make it, take me serious
Promise no more playin
You can put your trust in me
Baby girl that's all I'm sayin
When I'm on top she's screamin yeah yeah yeah yeah
Don't you ever let go
When I'm on top she's screamin yeah yeah yeah
Just so you know

(Pre-Chorus)
I can't forget about how you sex me down so good
I won't do you wrong
She be in my ear like baby

(Chorus)
Don't ever leave me no no
Don't ever leave me baby
Don't ever leave me no no
Don't ever leave me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
When I'm on top she's screamin yeah yeah yeah yeah
Just so you know
