Met a girl at the bar
Met a girl at the bar
She had stars in her eyes
A lil' conversation led us here back to my hotel
Told me she was down for anything as long as I won't kiss and tell
She left her number on the dresser, and her perfume on my pillow
She was gone before the sun went out

Chorus:
I shared a kiss with an angel
She must have fell from Heaven
We made love while the rain was pouring down
I shared a kiss with an angel
Her liá¹—s took my breath away
And we made love while the rain was pouring down
I forgot her name, her name, her name
What was her name, her name, her name
I forgot her name, her name, her name
What was her name, her name, her name
Her body, her smile, everything about her
I can't believe myself
Forgot her name, her name, her name
I forgot her name, her name, her name
I guess I'll call her Angel, angel, angel
When we danced, I escaped into a place in the clouds
Low ... and calling, the sex was in the air
20 minute ride down the 605, baby we almost there
I'm ready, you ready
Let's get it in girl, as soon as the door closes
She took her ass out, I laid her on the couch
Two hours later we was passed out

Chorus:
I spent the night with an angel
She must have fell from Heaven
We made love while the rain was pouring down
I shared a kiss with an angel
Her lips took my breath away
And we made love while the rain was pouring down
I forgot her name, her name, her name
What was her name, her name, her name
I forgot her name, her name, her name
What was her name, her name, her name
Her body, her smile, everything about her
I can't believe myself
Forgot her name, her name, her name
I forgot her name, her name, her name
I guess I'll call her Angel, angel, angel
I forgot her name, her name, her name
What was her name, her name, her name
I forgot her name, her name, her name
What was her name, her name, her name
Her body, her smile, everything about her
I can't believe myself
Forgot her name, her name, her name
I forgot her name
I guess I'll call her Angel, angel, angel
I guess I'll call her Angel, angel, angel
