I don't need you no more, no-oo, no-ooo
I don't want you no more, no-ooo, no-oo

[verse 1]
You had me so happy when our love first began
We ended so sadly caught in the act
I'll let u break my heart
Once before but it'll never happen again
And now u come around tryna apologies
Cause u heard from you're friends
That i be
Rollin'.. rollin.. rollin'..
Rollin'.. rollin'.. rollin'
Na na na na naaaa
Rollin'.. rollin and you hopin'.. hopin'
It's all better now, that ain't how its goin' down

[hook]
Ohh i don't need you no more, no-oo, no-ooo
Oh i don't want you no more, no-ooo, no-oo

[verse 2]
I remember so cleary you sayin' we were through
Now you cryin in the rain the only one to blame is you
It's not enough to bring me back, yeaaaah
U shoulda been the one i needed but you weren't there

So i, made my mind up to keep it pushin'
I know that one day you'll be wishin' you were my everything
All i needed was you're honesty, and
Said you were never leavin'
Plus you were a cheater, i don't need

[hook]
Ohh i don't need you no more, no-oo, no-ooo
Ohh i don't want you no more, no-noo, no-oo

[verse 3]

Club is grown and sexy and you take a shot, shot, shot
Huh, oh yeah baby i'm into ya
Wanna love me real good all night do ya
I just might do ya

[hook]
Oh oh oh, i don't need you no more, no-oo, no-ooo
Oh i don't want you no more, no-ooo, no-oo

I guess my love wasn't enough.. oooo
So long goodbye.. ooo
