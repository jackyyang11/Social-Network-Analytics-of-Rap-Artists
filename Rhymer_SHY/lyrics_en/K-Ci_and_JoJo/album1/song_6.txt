[Verse 1: K-Ci]
Ooh, how is it that I love you
But wanna only for one day
Be that as it may
Believe me when I say
I love to love you, baby
Real spit, I'm starting to believe
The shit was in my DNA
Respecting how I feel to be human nature
'Cause I know you felt the same way

[Pre-Chorus: K-Ci]
That's why I play it cool
That's why, never asked about dude
She never ever, she never, she never ever
She never asked about you

[Chorus: K-Ci & JoJo]
And they say don't ask, don't tell
'Cause she ain't going nowhere
And I ain't going nowhere
Even though we're going nowhere fast
And they say don't ask, don't tell
'Cause she ain't going nowhere
And I ain't going nowhere
And if she don't ask, I won't tell

[Verse 2: K-Ci]
Now woman this not how I plan to be
Baby girl, you gotta believe
But it don't matter now, 'cause how it worked out
We were doing the same thing
And I never lied to you
I never felt the need
Now I'm hit with guilt, 'cause you never tripped
This is how it had to be

[Pre-Chorus: K-Ci]
That's why I never called your phone
That's why you neevr called my home
I let you do you, you let me do me
We both know what's going on

[Chorus: K-Ci & JoJo]
And they say don't ask, don't tell
'Cause she ain't going nowhere
Nd I ain't going nowhere
Even though we're going nowhere fast
And they say don't ask, don't tell
'Cause she ain't going nowhere
And I ain't going nowhere
And if she don't ask, I won't tell

[Bridge: K-Ci & JoJo]
Girl, one day, baby, won't be a thing
You made me a one woman man
Put a ring on your finger
Girl, you can say it wouldn't be grand
But until that day, you know what they say

[Chorus: K-Ci & JoJo]
And they say don't ask, don't tell
'Cause she ain't going nowhere
And I ain't going nowhere
Even though we're going nowhere fast
And they say don't ask don't tell
'Cause she ain't going nowhere
And I ain't going nowhere
And if she don't ask, I won't tell
And they say don't ask, don't tell
'Cause she ain't going nowhere
And I ain't going nowhere
Even though we're going nowhere fast
And they say don't ask don't tell
'Cause she ain't going nowhere
And I ain't going nowhere
And if she don't ask, I won't tell
