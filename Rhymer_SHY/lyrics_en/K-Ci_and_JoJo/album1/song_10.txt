[Verse 1]
Don't give me an inch
'Cause I'll take it all now
Another style for you to hate
I sat up today, my style in the straight
And if you care to relate
No, you can't copy me
'Cause I been changed
Stay in your lane
Remain with the straight
Don't you cross that line
You goin' out of your mind
I got that grind so don't you hate

[Chorus]
You can judge me wrong
Don't leave home without my game face on
Got it goin' on
See my head is strong
Don't leave home without my game face on
Gotta keep it on
Try to play me wrong
Never forget you've got a game face on
Got it goin' on
When I wrote this song
Saw it in the mirror with my game face on
Got it goin' on

[Verse 2]
Gotta keep it on
Stay true to the bone, freak of the moan
So where they goin'
Gotta be in the zone
No chaperones, no earphone
It's time to get it on
I don't know what you all be on
But got be strong
I'm about ready to move on
Like Fidel Castro or Al Capone, Jodeci
Everybody wants to go

[Chorus]
You can judge me wrong
Don't leave home without my game face on
Got it goin' on
See my head is strong
Don't leave home without my game face on
Gotta keep it on
Try to play me wrong
Never forget you've got a game face on
Got it goin' on
When I wrote this song
Saw it in the mirror with my game face on
Got it goin' on

[Bridge]
Got my game face on
Got my game face on, gentlemen
Steady, yeah

[Chorus]
You can judge me wrong
Don't leave home without my game face on
Got it goin' on
See my head is strong
Don't leave home without my game face on
Gotta keep it on
Try to play me wrong
Never forget you've got a game face on
Got it goin' on
When I wrote this song
Saw it in the mirror with my game face on
Got it goin' on

[Outro]
I got my game face on
You better walk a straight line
