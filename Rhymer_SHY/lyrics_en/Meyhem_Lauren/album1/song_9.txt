[Intro: Big Body Bes]

[Verse 1: Meyhem Lauren]
Yo, Gucci kicks got me looking like a poinsettia
Don't speak all week, I appoint cheddar
Son with the bald head, left 'em all dead
He back servin' the spot, keepin' us all fed
Grilled swordfish, pineapple relish
Eyes lookin' hellish, I would die for my fellas
Fly like propellers, y'all niggas jealous
I don't give a fuck about shit that you could tell us
I'm only worried 'bout new checks
Touch down in Philly, cop sneakers from Suplex
Size 55 Carti's on my facial
Stash crib lookin palatial, we glacial

[Hook: Meyhem Lauren]
We do badmon ting, badmon ting
I put that motherfuckin' hoodie on
I pull that motherfuckin' skully down
We do gunman ting, gunman ting
The all-black Tim boot
Stay cool cause motherfuckers will shoot

[Verse 2: Meyhem Lauren]
Gold bar bottles, [?]
Flow worldwide, still poli on the bliddock
[?], yeah that's the mental
Talk out your face get whipped just like a rental
Respect my frame, I'm built just like a bulldozer
Teeth so white they never get pulled over
Damn it I'm gorgeous
Couple self-portraits up in the fortress
Larry David, Larry Davis
My style is like a mix of both, I'm outrageous
And ain't nobody out my family reach
My neck holds more Cubans than Miami Beach
Bitch

[Hook]


[Verse 3: Meyhem Lauren]
Persian rugs, asian antiques
New whips just to caravan freaks
Sorry I'm late, I'm stuck in drug traffic
Pistols precise, we carry thug plastic
Play the block every night cause we nocturnal
My wrist looks like a page out the Watch Journal
I get it shaking like the pulp settled at the bottom
Things y'all niggas rap about, my niggas really got em
My thigh is cramped from hoppin' off a jetski
My life is great, you think that you could stress me?
Shit, I'm a motherfuckin' G
This is grown man rap, rest in peace Sean P

[Hook]
