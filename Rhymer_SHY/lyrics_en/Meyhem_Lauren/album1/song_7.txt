[Verse 1: Meyhem Lauren]
Treat your friends like yourself and your family like blessings
It's sacred if you got the same click from adolescence
Keep a golden presence and base your worth beyond possessions
It's real, negative energy spreads like infections
Untreated left open right now my mind's soaking
In the Hennessy river but I ain't killing my liver
Hard liquor everyday you got a problem my nigga
Sip in moderation, limit your conversation
Dodge incarceration, pig anticipation
Part of my preparation on the daily
So it ain't going to be no fucking cake walk if they jail me
A rougher individual striving for better
Trying to find another way to get adequate cheddar
Without breaking my back or sitting in the cubicle
Even with a 3-piece on, that's unsuitable
Word

[Hook: J-Love]
OG son, yo we know survival
On these recession times
We move like the wise do
Original gangstas use mind over muscle
Respect's been earned, we the kings of hustle
Life is deep yo, analyze the elements
More in the spectrum than the hood life settlements
Wisdom surpasses ignorance and stupidity
Love for yourself is life's epitome

[Verse 2: Meyhem Lauren]
Weighing positives and negatives, calibrate the scale first
A lot of niggas get locked up for mere thirst
Fuck doing five years for five hundred
And if it's real beef, don't come through like who want it
Play the sideline and catch a nigga slippin'
Keep a low pro' whether you workin' or you pitchin'
Everybody want they name to ring out
But only niggas know my name have work in a drought
It's good to have dreams but don't neglect responsibilities
'Cause in the present future dreams ain't paying my utilities
I got three schemes plus I'll make three more
And the 4-6 feel, I could get that raw
I been official, more stripes than American flags
Or jail suits in movies, hop out coupes with uzis
Before niggas try to play my squad like Suzies
I'll be OT wipin' they blood off of my Gucci

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Meyhem Lauren]
If you drop seeds, raise them right, knowledge is contagious
You gotta hold your child down through different phases
Stages and ages keep their mental out of cages
Life's a book, you gotta keep flipping the pages
Then move on, looking for a better tomorrow
Fuck letting time slide over yesterday's sorrow
Search for something you could own not something to borrow
Make moves like 2-3 and 9-3 on Chicago
That's how I do son, play to win
Exterior's inferior without a drive from within
Stay sharp, raise again we been ill, born to win
I'll end where I begin, fuck a radio spin

[Hook]
