[Intro]
Yeah, Laurenovich, you already know
Can see me and my nigga Harry Fraud gettin' 10 dollar lap dances
Lookin' like young kings
We'll graciously walk in the dirtbag spot
Sit down and proceed to do wrong
Check it

[Verse 1]
Ayo raw dealer fly like Blake Griffin over a four-wheeler
If I get even and you breathin' hope the Lord heal ya
Thought you was live, looked in my eyes but then you saw realer
We train the bitches that you worship, you're a whore kneeler
Vaginas get smashed like negligent pedestrians
Rockin' fresh baldies, eatin' pussy like we lesbians
Irreversible illness, chains swingin' like they slap boxin'
Rap toxin, need to fall back or take the smack option
Sack watchin', dick riders, babysittin' moves I make
Still in the jungle, actin' humble movin' cubes of flake
You's a fake, your story couldn't pass the marker test
Bat cave is lookin' righteous, couldn't have a sharper rest
Ostrich flesh sprinkled with bleu cheese, my new steez
True G's, I play for that team, we got a winnin' record
Leave 'em hurtin', catch us workin' with a vicious ethic
Unsuspicious, clockin' riches, never unprotected

[Break]
And when we go in that dirtbag spot lookin' like money
They get offended cuz they know
That we're not gonna tip more than anyone else in there just because we could
So you see us in the dirtbag spot lookin' righteous
And know what the fuck time it is, we in here
Many nights I shot dice in the fuckin' drug den nigga hold on man

[Verse 2]
Keep my chain rocky, ok black, we stay strapped
Get deaded and disected, for your debt just call it payback
Gray hat, sneakers to match, look at me stylin'
You're a boat and I'm a portable island, in Mortons I'm smilin'
Last time I got a splash of steak juice on my medallion
Remain right, out in plain sight, we never prowlin'
Somethin' European wrapped around my foot
Get paid like Jeremy Wade, livin' off of the hook
Never sour, gave you power like a handed burner
We got stripes, grill marks on the salmon burger
Collectin' currency correctly I'm a candid learner
Banana clips, savannah trips, you just a standin' earner
