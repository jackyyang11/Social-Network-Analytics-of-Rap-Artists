See I don't be trippin to hit her
(nah I'm cool)
Got to see what else is in her
(what's in your mind girl)
(what's in your mind)
She just wants to roll with the winners
(yeah hop in you can roll)
And I'm cool with that
She cool with that
Baby it's all bout the vibe
Oh yay yay
Oh yay yay
Oh yay yay

[Verse 1: Ricco Barrino]
Im rolling 60 in a range
OG smokin' switching lanes
Yes sir
A nigga playin' H-Town
While Im on my way round
To pick your pretty ass up
I figured I would set the mood
And open up your door
Like a real playa should
I love the way you walk, you move
And how you carry all that ass
In those fly Jimmy Choo's
Wanna take you somewhere
So we can set the mood
And smoke a lil' hookah
In the VIP booth
While we sip on Ciroc
Lets mix it with the juice
And converse all night
I swear

[Bridge]
(That)
Im really loving your body
Lets just chill out and have our own party
We ain't got to invite nobody
Swear Im loving' the way we vibe'
Yeah

[Hook: Tigo B]
See I don't be trippin to hit her
Got to see what else is in her
She just wants to roll with the winners
(she just wanna roll with winners)
And I'm cool with that
She cool with that
Baby it's all bout the vibe
Oh yay yay
Baby it's all bout the vibe
Baby it's all bout the vibe

[Verse 2: Ricco Barrino]
(Oooh)
To keep it 100 girl
I wanna vibe with you (vibe with you)
(Oooh)
Smoke and get drunk
Talk that shit
And trip out with you
Theres so many things
I wanna do
Tonight I think a playa...
(Ooo)
I want you so bad
But Ima chill out instead
So now I got you in the place
That we can set the mood
And puff a lil hookah
In our VIP booth
While we sip on Ciroc
Lets mix it with the juice
And converse all night
I swear
