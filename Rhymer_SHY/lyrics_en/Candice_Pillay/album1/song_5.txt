[Chorus]
Feels like I'm lost without you
Feels like I'd rather find my way
My morning starts without you
Feels like I'm lost without you
Feels like I'm lost without you
Feels like I'd rather find my way
Feels like I'm lost without you
Feels like I'm lost without you

[Verse 1]
I'm drowning inside
There's nobody there
I'm hoping you'll dive in
If you're there again

[Pre-Chorus]
Swim with me
Why don't you jump in, rescue me?
I need you to capture me and take me in your arms
Swim with me
Why don't you jump in, rescue me?
I need you to capture me and take me in your arms
Swim with me
Why don't you jump in, rescue me?
I need you to capture me and take me in your arms
Swim with me
Why don't you jump in, rescue me?
I need you to capture me and take me in your arms

[Chorus]
Feels like I'm lost without you
Feels like I'd rather find my way
My morning starts without you
Feels like I'm lost without you
Feels like I'm lost without you
Feels like I'd rather find my way
Feels like I'm lost without you
Feels like I'm lost without you

[Verse 2]
You promised and lied
There was nothing there
I dived in head first swimming to nowhere
Like you even cared

[Pre-Chorus]
Swim with me
Why don't you jump in, rescue me?
I need you to capture me and take me in your arms
Swim with me
Why don't you jump in, rescue me?
I need you to capture me and take me in your arms
Swim with me
Why don't you jump in, rescue me?
I need you to capture me and take me in your arms
Swim with me
Why don't you jump in, rescue me?
I need you to capture me and take me in your arms

[Chorus]
Feels like I'm lost without you
Feels like I'd rather find my way
My morning starts without you
Feels like I'm lost without you
Feels like I'm lost without you
Feels like I'd rather find my way
Feels like I'm lost without you
Feels like I'm lost without you
Feels like I'm lost without you
Feels like I'd rather find my way
My morning starts without you
Feels like I'm lost without you
Feels like I'm lost without you
Feels like I'd rather find my way
Feels like I'm lost without you
Feels like I'm lost without you
