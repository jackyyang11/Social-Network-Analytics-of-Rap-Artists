[Verse 1]
This is not the man that I once knew
You don't look like him at all
I see your disguise but I'm not fooled
I am not the one to fall anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
Here we, here we are
You and, you and I, standin' in the dark
No one here but us
You and, you and I, walkin' in the park
Caught me from behind
Baby leave your mark, let you see me spark
Gimme all you got
Gimme your best shot

[Chorus]
Lie-lie, lie-lie, lie-lie, lie-lie
Lie-lie, lie-lie, lie-lie, lie-lie
Lie-lie, lie-lie, lie-lie, lie-lie
Lie-lie, lie-lie, lie-lie, lie-lie
Lie-lie, lie-lie, lie-lie, lie-lie
Lie-lie, lie-lie, lie-lie, lie-lie

[Verse 2]
I am not the girl that you once knew
I will not give in to you
After all the shit that you put me through
I will not become your fool, no I won't

[Pre-Chorus]
Here we, here we are
You and, you and I, standin' in the dark
No one here but us
You and, you and I, walkin' in the park
Caught me from behind
Baby leave your mark, let you see me spark
Gimme all you got
Gimme your best shot

[Chorus]
Lie-lie, lie-lie, lie-lie, lie-lie
Lie-lie, lie-lie, lie-lie, lie-lie
Lie-lie, lie-lie, lie-lie, lie-lie
Lie-lie, lie-lie, lie-lie, lie-lie
Lie-lie, lie-lie, lie-lie, lie-lie
Lie-lie, lie-lie, lie-lie, lie-lie

[Bridge]
Speed it up, shut it down
Shoot me up from the ground
To the sky, to the clouds
From the clouds to the sky
Shoot me up, watch me fall
From a high coming down
From the lies [?]
From the tide I have drawn
From your [?] you are crowned
But can you hear that sound?
She ain't here, she's gone

[Chorus]
Lie-lie, lie-lie, lie-lie, lie-lie
Lie-lie, lie-lie, lie-lie, lie-lie
Lie-lie, lie-lie, lie-lie, lie-lie
Lie-lie, lie-lie, lie-lie, lie-lie
Lie-lie, lie-lie, lie-lie, lie-lie
Lie-lie, lie-lie, lie-lie, lie-lie
