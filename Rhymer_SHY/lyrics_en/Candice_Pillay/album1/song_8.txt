[Intro]
We will not stand, we will not stand
We will not stand, we will not stand silent
We will not stand, we will not stand (ooh)
We will not stand, we will not stand silent (wee)
We will not stand, we will not stand (ooh)
We will not stand, we will not stand silent (wee)

[Verse 1]
We're the kids with the slick tongues running our mouths all day
Cause we got a lot to say
And we walk with our heads up high
We don't back down no
We don't go down easy

Roll down, run it down
Roll down with me (eh)
Roll down, run it down
Roll down with me (eh)
Roll down, run it down
Roll down with me (eh)

[Chorus](2x)
We will not stand, we will not stand
We will not stand, we will not stand silent
We will not stand, we will not stand
We will not stand, we will not stand silent
We will not stand, we will not stand
We will not stand, we will not stand silent

[Repeat All]
