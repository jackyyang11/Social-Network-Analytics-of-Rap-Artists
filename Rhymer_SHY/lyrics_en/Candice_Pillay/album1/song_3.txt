[Intro]
Fall in love, fall in love
Fall in love, fall in love
Fall in love, fall in love
Fall in love, fall in love
Fall in love, fall in love
Fall in love, fall in love

[Verse 1]
Tell my hoes goodbye, tell 'em keep it tight
Tell 'em don't be sad, it's gon' be alright
I will not forget, all our special time
All the special ed, especially the head
Don't forget to write, always be polite
Left there in the day, don't believe the hype
Hope when I'm away, things won't be so rough
Cause while you fall astray, I'm gon' fall in love

[Chorus]
Love, love, love
Love, love, fall, love
Fall, love, fall, love
Fall, love, fall, love
Fall in love, fall in love
Fall in love, fall in love
Fall in love, fall in love
Fall in love, fall in love

[Verse 2]
We were thick as thieves, such dirty crooks
The money that we got, could put it on my books
Bunch of dirty crimes, get all the dirty looks
Sorry things have changed, sorry I've been hooked
My heart belongs to John, but I remember Doe
We used to have the fun, we did it on the low
Oh those were the days, now I must move on
You must fall away, I'ma fall in love

[Chorus]
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, fall, love
Fall, love, fall, love
Fall, love, fall, love
Fall in love, fall in love
Fall in love, fall in love
Fall in love, fall in love
Fall in love, fall in love

[Outro]
Fall in love, fall in love
Fall in love, fall in love
Fall in love, fall in love
Fall in love, fall in love
