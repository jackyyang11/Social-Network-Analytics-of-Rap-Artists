[Verse 1]
Fuck your Hollywood handshakes
Save your Malibu hugs (Down diggy down)
Mob through your Bev Hills landscapes
Whole squad on the way to the club (Down diggy down)
Fuck your howdy ho friend face
My back sees all of your shrugs (Down diggy down)
No thank you, I feel dandy
Just me and all of my thugs

[Pre-Chorus]
With our sidewalk dreams
Our aluminum rings
All the finer things
Is in between you and me
Sidewalk dreams
We're no name kings
You can keep your drinks
Cause I'm already lit, yeah
I'm already there

[Chorus]
Cause we party 4 da low
Yeah we party 4 da low
Look out for them folks
Still we party 4 da low
Smoke out the window
On our way to the show
Yeah we party 4 da low
Yeah we party 4 da low
Look out for them folks
Party 4 da low
Smoke out the window
On our way to the show
Yeah we party 4 da low

[Verse 2]
Fuck your name brand namesakes
Save your attitude, hun (Down diggy down)
Let's have bacon and pancakes
Who needs grey poupon? (Down diggy down)
Life's a glass of lemonade
Down that shit in one gulp (Down diggy down)
Never know when you might see your grave
So let's ride 'til the wheels fall off

[Pre-Chorus]
With our sidewalk dreams
Our aluminum rings
All the finer things
Is in between you and me
Sidewalk dreams
We're no name kings
You can keep your drinks
Cause I'm already lit, yeah
I'm already there

[Chorus]
Cause we party 4 da low
Yeah we party 4 da low
Look out for them folks
Still we party 4 da low
Smoke out the window
On our way to the show
Yeah we party 4 da low
Yeah we party 4 da low
Look out for them folks
Party 4 da low
Smoke out the window
On our way to the show
Yeah we party 4 da low

[Bridge]
Hey if it's alright with you
I'd like to put my middle finger up to the sky
And feel the groove
What you wanna do?
If you was Kool & The Gang
Then I might have gotten high with you

Cause I'm already lit, yeah
I'm already there

[Chorus]
Cause we party 4 da low
Yeah we party 4 da low
Look out for them folks
Still we party 4 da low
Smoke out the window
On our way to the show
Yeah we party 4 da low
Yeah we party 4 da low
Look out for them folks
Party 4 da low
Smoke out the window
On our way to the show
Yeah we party 4 da low
