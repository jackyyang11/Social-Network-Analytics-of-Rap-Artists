[Verse 1]
This bottle of rum is all I need
Gonna fill up my cup when I'm empty
It loves me the way I like
Goes down easy

[Pre-Chorus]
I wake up in my bed holdin' my head
Fall to my knees clutchin' my chest
When I'm not sober you don't really mean a thing
I throw back
I pour em strong
To take the edge up offa me

[Chorus]
Drinkin' to get you off my mind
Drinkin' to waste away the time
Drinkin' the tears, I wanna cry
Cause I've been drinkin' of you
Cause I've been drinkin' of you

[Verse 2]
This house ain't a home when I'm all alone
And the party go up so I don't come down
I'm happy for a little while
Til the buzz leave me

[Pre-Chorus]
I wake up in my bed holdin' my head
Fall to my knees clutchin' my chest
When I'm not sober you don't really mean a thing
I throw back
I pour em strong
To take the edge up offa me

[Chorus]
Drinkin' to get you off my mind
Drinkin' to waste away the time
Drinkin' the tears, I wanna cry
Cause I've been drinkin' of you
Cause I've been drinkin' of you

[Bridge]
Baby I've been drinkin' of you
So I drown myself in this whiskey of love
I throw back
I pour em strong
To take the edge up offa me

[Chorus]
Drinkin' to get you off my mind
Drinkin' to waste away the time
Drinkin' the tears, I wanna cry
Cause I've been drinkin' of you
Cause I've been drinkin' of you
