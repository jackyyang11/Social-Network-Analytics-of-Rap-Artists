[Verse]
A yo Premier told me get 'em so I got 'em
He loaded up the K's in the snares and I shot 'em
Sunni Muslim pants chopped at the bottom
Bullets like Drake cause they started from the bottom
And then through your stomach, and up right through your torso
Hurricane Jakk when I let the four fours blow, blow
Ya niggas sound so-so, so
Kick in your door with the chrome four four
Holy ghost with the toast make the devil disappear
Your bitch chose me cause there's levels to this beard
50 shot mag, yeah, there’s levels to this clip
From Mecca to Medina yeah there's levels to my trips
Beard Gang General that makes me the head honcho
I get away with murder like I drive a white Bronco
AK-47's that will rip through your Tahoe
Guns get the clapping and the barrel's screaming bravo
Bullets wet you through your poncho
Disrespect niggas like Carlito did to Benny Blanco
Frosty, but I still scorch a fella
When I bust guns, they call me the fortune teller
I could tell you your future, you gon' bleed from mine
Rubber grips read my palm, slugs read your mind
Handgun tactics that's redesigned
I turn bullets into bookworms to read your spine
Premier was making a beat, I said "Preem rewind"
Dump that so I can spit that, the flow like a 12-gauge kickback
Nigga this is Big Jakk
Pop up at your crib, mask on when it's pitch black
Grip your bitch up like "bitch, where them bricks at?"
I only empty clips on niggas claiming that they're rich at
She said he was fronting, this is a recording
Slash real life and this is his real wife
My barrel to her temple, told her plain and simple
I'm fresh off the hospital, baby I am mental
Murdering motherfuckers off of these instrumentals
Made by Premo, you's a kingpin turned snitch like Nino
Get your brains blown on the roof like G Money
It's no limit, I see murder and see money
Jakk freezer, flow's sharp as a meat cleaver
Got these white boys drinking prometh like Justin Bieber
Told you before I got O's in the freezer
Bring birds back like a golden retriever
The doc won't be stitching up them holes in you either
Six million dollar flow call me coke sievers
The flow is half acid, 50% ether
