Baby, baby, baby, I'm gonna leave you
I said baby, you know I'm gonna leave you
I'll leave you when the summertime
Leave you when the summer comes arollin'
Leave you when the summer comes along
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I don't wanna leave you
I ain't jokin' woman, I got to ramble
Oh yeah, baby, baby, I won't be there
Really got to ramble
I can hear it callin' me the way you used to do
I can hear it callin' me back home
Woman, woman, I know, I know
I know it's good to have you back again
And I know that one day, baby
It's really gonna grow, yes it is
We gonna go walkin' through the park
Every day, hey, hear what I say, every day
