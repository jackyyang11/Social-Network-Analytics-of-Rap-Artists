[Intro]
Uh Fuck it!

[Verse 1]
I have been moping around I cannot get out of my bed
I am so damn tired I cannot get out of my head
The only time I smile is when I brush my teeth
The sex last night sucked I would have rather been asleep

[Chorus]
It is been a bad, bad day but who gives a shit (Huh?)
I could be sad all day but I do not feel like it (No!)
I feel like “Eh eh eh..eh eh eh eh eh”
I feel like “Eh eh eh..eh eh eh eh eh”
I feel like “Eh eh eh..eh eh eh eh eh”
I feel like “EH EH EH..EH EH EH EH EH”

[Verse 2]
It is two in the morning someone tell me why there is traffic
I wish I had a bumper car; I would road-rage your ass with it
I guess I have a choice I do not have to be this grumpy
Because there is plenty of other losers got it way worse than me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Couple of deep breaths [breaths]
There I feel better already [breaths]
Couple more [breaths]
Damn what could it be [breaths]
See we should all be happy [breaths]
50 Cent said we could all lick his lollipop
He is going to take us to the candy shop

[Hook]
I feel like “Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh”
I feel like “Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh”
I feel like “Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh”
I feel like “Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh”

[Verse 4]
Come with me
Take my hand
Let us climb some trees
Throw me in the air
Laugh with me (we will have so much fun)
Smile with me (yay)
Play with me
Cannot we all just get along?
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]

[Hook]
I feel like “Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh”
I feel like “EH EH EH..EH EH EH EH EH EHHH OWWW
UUUgggghhhhhhhh!!!

[Outro]
I am so glad
Everything is rad everything is rad

OOOWWW ROCK AND ROLL!!!
