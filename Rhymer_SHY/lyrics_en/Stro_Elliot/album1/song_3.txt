[Verse 1] Mr. J. Medeiros
He’s an attack charmer in black armor
Call him the guardian
Who stacks karma with a knack for drama
A hardhearted man
Cardigan father bothered the bar again
The night prior started a riot
Fired for targeting the students
Masked in prudence brutally bruised him
They youtube’d him
So even the affluent could view him
Felon or cop he’s milking the spot
Selling the pelted with rocks story
To cover the gory
And the yelling to stop
Surely they got it and understood it
The plot wooded
Could it be the block stood in it hooded
And shot footage
While he took shots at a good kid
Who fought still
Taught to foot a bill but he wouldn’t
It’s a bon fire when you baton a child in line tired
Of being conned fired withdrawn and blind sided
And gone with a sign on the lawn
It’s non-violent but warned
You in the eye of the storm
That U N I formed

Whatcha Whatcha Whatcha want
I guess you’re funny with that badge that you flaunt
So where’d you get your information from huh

[Verse 2] Bernz
Live in a world without heroes
Living without ethos
Doin what I gotta so I'm protecting my peoples
Who sellin more kilos? Who really bandidos?
Who's really gone reload a clip and then face evil?
I hate a pigs ego
Thinkin they see all
But never seen below
I'm writing some new credo's
See absolute power corrupts all the nino's
Who's really gone save us from us with no zero's
Money for freedom see them scramble for quota's
And motive's I'm an Iota fedora to cover face for em
Cuz they know I know em I went to school with a couple
Even chiefed with chief at the beach on the humble
Under every warmonger's a scared lil f**ker
Either that or hunger runnin the beasts and bloodsuckers
And ask Mrs. Tucker whether she seen a few in the struggle
In the bubble only fear exists in hot summers
Just another number slumber and death can come love ya
I'm bust a flare in the District of Columbia
Whens it's all said and done bacon cooks on pavement
And my black friends shook to even drive the north end
Its real

[Verse 3] Wrekonize:
Snapped outta my daydream to flashing red wattage
Pulled over baked beans knocking on my cottage
With a glazed eye gaze and a smirk that was satanist
Playing mind games with him
To ease all my patience it's
Getting insane
They way treat us in vain
My cynicism's been stained
By they chromed out pimp cane
Disperse pepper spray in 5 new flavors
Then they all Chris Angel what they say to newspapers
New electric boogaloo tazer on kill
Gimme another excuse to chew this place is unreal
Conceal true feelings now at first that kinda seemed great
But silence keeps the violence vibrant in this here police state
Long live the Pros for Beats sake
The memories my keep sake
Until they try to each take
A piece of me away and lock it up in evidence
It's evident my efforts in these 20 bars are better spent
Trying to stay in front of bars running from their f**king cars
Undercover sucka squads beating me with rubber laws
Gauze wrapped around another brothers jaws
While We Suffer hard corrupt is stuck at large
