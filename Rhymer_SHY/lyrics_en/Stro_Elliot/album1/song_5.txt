Mr. J. Medeiros
In my of gods and girls days
I was at odds with how those girls played
Many betrayed with a facade to have it her way
Ladies love it the way we covet name your puppet
James or Bobby same old hobby blaming the pulpit
For the tenants of freewill we’re meant to be equal
In street intelligence and our propensity for evil
Begging for her acceptance in my repentance
For every man that ever sinned her though I was sentenced
To do the sacrifice to please so I ask if I’m naïve
Though it’s true that in the past I wasn’t half of nice with eve
I had advice to leave but I thought I had to lead
So I dragged us through the sadness thinking I had to believe
Leaves used to cover our shame how the colors have changed
When only one for the other remains what’s thunder and rain
But a poor metaphor a door with a knock and a box on the floor
Full of things I’d forgotten before it got rotten
Spring summer and fall and now I’m not him
Her wings summoned it all see how the plot thins
I think under it all I saw the topspin the way I dropped in
And couldn’t bounce back in 2004 I wrote the soundtrack
It’s where I found that strength to break through
And for that pain I thank you

We couldn't see it through the fire, fire
We couldn't see it over our heads, not yet
We couldn't see it through the fire, fire
She was so cold
She was so cold

Stro Elliot
I run the risk
I run the risk of sounding bitter on this verse
Reminded of a time I shed a tear over this skirt
See this is too heavy
Already calling you out of your name, ain't that funny?
Ain't thought about you in years, and here I'm still running
Trying to get away from the adolescence you took from me
Here's what I'll do honey
I'll change your name to something random for the sake of the song
Hmmm let's call you Shelly
A Name you hated
It's petty ain't it? But a perfect illustration of this love we painted
By the numbers, and I wonder why we couldn't see it
In frame, but out of focus, this scene void of emotion
What's my motivation?
Is that your body or manipulation?
"Hey, let me pay for that darling" triggered the revelation
But I'm in love right
Or maybe young and quite oblivious
To love and what it's really supposed to look like
Till that December night...
5 minutes later, I never would have noticed that other man's busted tail light
Running that stop sign to escape, I should have followed suit
I quickly ran out of cards and ceased to follow you
But I ain't angry at all, and that's the honest truth
These women in my cellular phone provide the final proof
Shelly...
My inspiration, my muse, my excuse
My explanation for excess, my next you
