DNA

[Verse 1] Stro Elliot
There I was about less than a year old
According to the story that my mother told
She couldn't get her little boy to sleep
Till my father put that Ronnie Laws record on repeat
The beginning of a love affair that I chose
To keep hidden till my grandfather exposed
The love letters he would find every week
In a laugh, in a dance, in a nod to the beat
Yup, this one is a leader
The 1st chair drummer tri-toms with the feet up
Somebody told me bout a rap song turn the beat up
I'ma need her, that Baum Applebaum that Bonita
The lunchroom table got applause, and the teacher in the hall
Made a call saying, "ya'll need to meet up"
We all got together in the Fall Pangaea
It all fell apart when the summertime freed up
The otherwise dedicated guys from the lunch line
Started looking at me like naw nevermind
Well that's it, can't perform without a line-up
My brother telling me that I should still sign up
He put his money on a studio recording
Back then so important, even though we didn't know it then
So hey brother, when that child starts yawning
I'ma play a lullaby and put them headphones on him


[Verse 2] Mr. J. Medeiros
Ain't had a dime at the month of nine
In my mind I see my Mom when I hunt for lines
Punching time at a Gessi’s at a time when them penny’s
Combined don’t add much to a family of five
Said I was barely alive had to burry the knives cut me out
Whatchu know about carrying lives
Out of doubt and needing chances
Ain't seeing advances my Parents stance was these stamps ain't the answer
Momma braved through it but her head was pained after
Got a brain tumor but they said it ain't cancer
Father gave to us the Word obey master
Honesty and truth are the words that came after
Honor for the troops he’s a military man
Taught the skill of every hand must be paid for, crafted
It’s in my name why the fame ain't matter
It’s a family thing being a day old rapper
It’s the hands that it brings like the Saints in old chapters
Together in sync like the paintings in old chapels
Press on the ink I’m playing these old samples
Blessings that link old days to new sad ones
Happy to have them saving my thoughts
From the day that they bought that album and gave me that box
I was playing the King of Rock like the king of the block
Not knowing they had to save for the things that I got
