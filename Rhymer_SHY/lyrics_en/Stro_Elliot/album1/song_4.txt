[Mr. J. Medeiros]
With the force of an active chief with mob boss apathy
This urban city sprawl into a Bob Ross masterpiece
Opportunities calls lost music industry fast asleep
Our community calls for unity in these backward streets
Reverse hustle words muffled by the corporate monster
The verse muscle the worst of them without a corporate sponsor
Why we storing bombs for future nuclear engagements
Our city’s armed for war and in my backyard is were their tanks sit
Dominating I’m awaiting our common denominating
Calm but I’m debating why these arms of ours are found of hating
These limbs lethal dosage these grins leave us hopeless
These rims keep us focused children eat and sleep with roaches
Abnormal abdominal pain you just have to add this corn meal to your chronicle pain
Illustrated for a comical gain my biological frame
Used illogical for economical reign terminology is not for the plain
We are being used and coming out our mommas in vain
Remember that part in the Matrix where they were farming for brains
And you think that’s just a movie
That metaphor it moved me get it before you loose speed
And head into war with a loose seed
Spawning a new greed the calling of a new breed
Crawling from deep inside the walls in which you bleed

Somebody get me off of this thing
I really want to get up off of this sing
I can’t see it I’m lost on this thing
I gotta find a way to get off of this thing
Somebody get me off of this thing
I really want to get up off of this sing
I can’t see it I’m lost on this thing
I gotta find a way to get off of this thing

[Stro]
Lost in a transmission of a rerun, channel zero for documentories
Of child heroes, a motivational evil on a podium
Headspin on a sandpaper linoleum floor
Similar friction making a way for a war
Give your money to the rich take it away from the poor
Nobody knocked before that battering ram shattered the door
Lookin like "what you mad at me for?"
A better question is that gun you waiving at me my protection or yours
Innocent die from a probable cause character flaw
On a sketch pad, the trigger happy families sad
Life spinning out of remote control
Watch a murderer kill washing his hands before he washes his soul
And the leaders turn the truth into an awful joke
Making a profit off the words that a prophet spoke
Liquor drops on the floor where the baby bottle broke
And inside of the mother's coat medicine without a doctors note
A fire started in a strawberry field
Pop culture imitated in pop warner they pop pills
Outside at a bus stop nickolodeon backdrop
Double dare on a sesame street, sound of a gunshot
Flares for nitelites scattered bullets for lullibyes
Symphony of the chaotic soundtrack of the frontlines
Heavy metal elevator music to cloud nine
Revoloutionary radiohead trip enjoy the ride

Hook-


Somebody get me off of this thing
I really wanna get up off of this thing
I can't see and I'm lost on this thing
I gotta find a way to get off of this thing
(repeat)
