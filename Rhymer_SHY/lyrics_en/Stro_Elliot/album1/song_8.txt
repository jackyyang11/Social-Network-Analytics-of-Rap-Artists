Fall to Fly

[Verse 1 Mr. J. Medeiros]
Dealing with demons got them feeling secluded
And muted without a clue how to heal them
We call them in our confusion to hear that they miss us
But I fear that this sickness well it’s mirror depicted
Leave us here with no witness
And though it’s clear as forgiveness what’s in us is our own secrets
We frequently swallow regrets
And follow tomorrows events with hollow hours of sleep
The sorrow borrowed was deep and now it’s on us to keep
Throwing flowers out at their feet
What started as darkness found its way through the anger
First we viewed it as heartless from the mood of a stranger
Now it’s newly upon us for every night has it’s dawning
These are the feelings you go through
When you fight through the mourning
Couldn’t force them to live found remorse in a sieve
We are more then our death need a force to forgive
Higher forces at play shinning as the source of our day
Keep us reminded of our timing and how often it change

[Hook Stro Elliot]
Every single day I watch time pass by
Watch a man fall
Choose to fly

[Verse 2 Mr. J. Medeiros]
How could you take what you haven’t invented
Yet at the beginning you ended it
We could have laughed we could have mended it
You could have asked before you attempted it
Now forgetting it isn’t an option
But I’m letting you out of that coffin
Remembering you as a friend
As someone I love and think of too often
When I drink to get lost or when I think of the cost
Make me a cross now it’s over and done
Sober me up in the sun then take me across
To a day where you’re a good memory
And the pain is as good as a melody
And I play it as if you were telling me
This is how you should remember me
Just tell them we couldn’t hate them we hated we couldn’t save them
The weight of it all was living forgive them
The way it ate them was hidden like face paintings
We trace statements and place blame
Staying patient on the days we can’t change
Grateful for what they gave us
Those days will always be famous
And though they have flown away
We know it’s not to where their grave is
In our hearts is where they take us
The oddities that make us
Searching for our God in the chaos

[Hook Stro Elliot]
Every single day I watch time pass by
Watch a man fall
Choose to fly

[Mr. J. Medeiros]
When your mind is racing facing the trouble of a dead friend
Struggling with dead ends you gotta cut a new path
Save the day’s they left with you and everything they meant to you
Plant it in the dust they left and trust it to make new grass
