[VERSE 1]
Who needs a chip on a wrist
When you’re packing a cellie
With you all the time
The government already - in yo mind
Check the millennium design
Niggas got us all for pennies on a dime
You could say that I’m bugged out
Tripping on a rhyme
But every time you log in
Your privacy will decline

You could hide behind the sidelines
High rise and skylines
I told you - highlight - but lines
Have warned you
The world wide web
Got you flies on the thread
And the camera on your Mac
Is like eyes to a fed
You remember when I said
When it’s over
J Edgar Hoover nowdays look like
Hova - get it

Undercovers look just like us
They play the part like they your dog
But it’s all for the anti-bust
That’s why I’m always so anti-trust
We could have a drink
But don’t think you could get by us

(you hear me)

[Chorus]
This is a dawn of a new age
Mad mother fucking mind control
News stayed glued to the front page
Rage vocals - sway God ?
Wage war with officials
Fuck all of ya

A chip on the wrist is just a hit on the list
And I’m a shit on the hit
With a flick of the fist

Conspiracy soldiers remain on call


[VERSE 2]
Fingerprint - unlocking you E Y E phone
Keeps your girl out
But the government deep tho
Even if you hitting delete tho
They get enough info for the RICO
Probably finito
Conspiracy for crime
And they don’t need a dime
They know what you’re saying
And what you said its on the line
Even if the GPS is not live
You cannot hide blunt white lies
Got ya’ll blind
Open up ya eyes like mine
Try snitching on lock
Get you caught up and the feds don’t mind
Pictures of dope - flicks of nines
Pigs will take note
Cause they’ve been following you this whole time
Huh

Careful with the frequencies you put out
You know they’ve been always trying to take the hood out
They gettin info straight from the source
And will pull out
Files that you sent
Good luck trying to pull out

[Chorus]
This is a dawn of a new age
Mad mother fucking mind control
News stayed glued to the front page
Rage vocals - sway God ?
Wage war with officials
Fuck all of ya

A chip on the wrist is just a hit on the list
And I’m a shit on the hit
With a flick of the fist

Conspiracy soldiers remain on call

[OUTRO]
The simplest shit ain’t plain to see
The simplest shit ain’t plain to see

Man down - the enemy dies for free
