[Verse One]
I’m at the drug lab trying to figure out my next move
I’ve gotta make this raw street hop break through
This criminology rap that slash fake crews
Like insanity that make front page news
I’m the head trauma that makes your scar face bruise
MCs nowadays lose with bars they use
There’s a war between Heaven and Hell, which do you choose?
No matter what side homes you gotta pay dues
My central intelligence was birthed in my residence
Downtown tenements were grim and no elements man
I live my life while the wicked try ending it
My brain’s more fucked up than joints with a stem in it
Your weak shit I’m deading it all for the cause
I’ll be crucifying your lies live on a Jesus cross
We hold our own court when truth is the judge
I got hollow jurors that give out guilty verdicts in blood

[Hook] {x2}
These words that I live by
One day I might die by
Make my mom cry
Will this shit get worse for me?
The CIA murder me for talking in third degree in a state of emergency


[Verse 2]
Still make the world panic more than gang faggots lead masses
Go beyond banging, fuck religion
Meditate with the poised, I’m ramming horns with the Jewish
I’m talking ? moves than speak agnostic when I walk through Jerusalem
Cleanse you, come and swell out your Lakota-Sioux
We’ve been through the stars, seen the birds named Jesus
His ink clues write truth aimed to wake the youth
Before they waste their talent, end up locking a shoot
C’mon, I’m culminating when I’m in the meridian
Illumination, fuck being an idiot
A master mason when I’m building my pyramid
Medicine man blowing up the schools of Americans
I’ll let you go tell a friend, determination to leave my fam
In war to cross dope we kill a minuteman
I’m living paranoid, I think it’s the end
July 10th the Earth wept when I took my first breath

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
We deal up with a system designed to confuse niggas minds
And it’s worse when the people divide
Fighting titans, ruling the Earth’s tyrants
Evil alliance trying to blind us and changing the ancient god sciences
Instead of taking knowledge and applying it
The devils reversed the knowledge and gave us the spell of leviathan
God became dark, meaning a dark star
Represented by Anubis am I losing y’all?
Hope y’all ready for war, I be busting
Turn the trumpets blow to signify the end for us all
With a tent, a canteen, and a chrome .44
Not dealing with man’s rituals but with God’s laws
And I know I’m on the list for the things that I spit
The government act as if the artists are terrorists
They terribly pissed because the kids listen to this
And get influenced by the music so they can’t tell em shit
This is rebel music, nigga raise your fist
The words that I speak a nigga live and die by this
I’m just a poet with an ancient soul
A master teacher that knows how to break down speak in code

[Hook]
