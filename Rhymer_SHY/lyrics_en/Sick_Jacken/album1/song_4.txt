[Verse 1: Sick Jacken]
Crack heavy on the streets
Track memory on the beats
Sliding Coco puffs in downtown
Belly of the beast
Getting work by the brick 'n sell it by the piece
I got foot soldiers, I ain't sweatin' the police
I made a killing off crack in the 80's
Let me tell you how I did it
I got a group of homies that was down with it
We started small ops, cuz [?] had a strap by the [?]
Got half the [?] with it
Hand to hand exchanges with strangers
Before gang bangers started taxing street corner hustlers
It was less dangerous
My scale name price but the money came nameless
We took coke and turned it into something more famous
Where freebasing keep pluggin', all kinds of sick comin'
Gold chains to tape decks, TV to dick suckin'
Supply and demand the people meant nothing
If it wasn't me it would have been the next man hustlin'


[Hook]
What type of drugs do you do?
I probably served you
Your daddy and your momma that birthed you
On the grind from morning to past curfew
In the decade of dope im here to [?] you
Whether its a kilo, gram, take a pill or slam
You can call me the deala' man
I serve the streets cuz' I put the candy in your hand
In the decade of dope, I'm your pusha' man


[Verse 2: Cynic]
Yo I'm a late 70's baby
So I was raised in the 80's
My favorite phrase is fuck you then pay me
I first learned how to lace a J before I weighed 80'
Pounds now I drop em' while the starving in Haiti
Smoking weed and hashish that's something real ancient
Hashashins used to get high before they would slay
Yo these rappers kind of influenced me to start blazin'
What I'm saying my [?] then gettin high in the basement
I know they used to puff heavy back in the 60's
The Who was smoking kush with the Doors at the [?]
And I ain't ill by getting head from Mrs. Lewinski
But we live in hell so I smoke to understand the mysteries
Indigenous and me, sipping [?] and the tea
Eating mushrooms blowing breeze
Live in nature with the trees
Cyprus Hill got me stoned, made me want to kill a man
Reakwon and Ghost Face made me go and sniff some grams

[Hook]
What type of drugs do you do?
I probably served you
Your daddy and your momma that birthed you
On the grind from morning to past curfew
In the decade of dope im here to [?] you
Whether its a kilo, gram, take a pill or slam
You can call me the deala' man
I serve the streets cuz' I put the candy in your hand
In the decade of dope, I'm your pusha' man
