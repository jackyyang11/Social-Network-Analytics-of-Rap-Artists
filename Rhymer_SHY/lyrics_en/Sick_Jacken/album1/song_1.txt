[Verse 1: Sick Jacken]

It's a brave new world
This generation faces 2012 and the war between god and hell
And we're still sent to rot in jails
We're in a post-revelation era attempts to stop it failed
A serpent smiles from behind the veil
Streets are ready for a revolution
That's why my rhymes prevail
I'm in a city where the lions dwell
Roam in packs like sickdogs but most of 'em die in cells
Real gangbanging lived in the 90's
Most kids now don't even know why the fuck they're fighting
It's end of days music you don't know why you're dying
I bring a warning to the streets with these songs I'm writing

[Verse 2: Cynic]

Still destroy each other nightly
I don't think they understand what is that we put in writing
Bodies still dropped by lighting in this never
Ending war we fighting everybody dying
I keep on having little dreams of mine
Where I survive and no one else alive
I walk alone where the shadows dwell but
Their hearts are crying trapped in these
Streets of mine where the enemy's still the swine
I realize what it is but what it do the truth could
Change me and the rest of the troops
Together ain't know way we could lose we taking aim
Preparing man for the end of the king I hope
You know what I mean...

[Hook]

Even when you die time don't stand still
Surviving this, the only reason man kills
This is prophecy not philosophy
Annihilation of human kind is haunting me
I used to chase dreams now it's 2012 a.d
When the gods wipe the slate clean
This is prophecy not philosophy
Annihilation of human kind is haunting me


[Verse 3: Sick Jacken]

We're living in the last days
I'm trying to survive the man-snakes
Open your third-eye homie join the masked race
They're sucking the blood from earth at a fast pace
And come in the name of god but they lack grace
We wear a cross with jesus hanging
When the homies give their life up for us
In the streets banging
I know some good people that died for a cause
I should put 'em on my neck where I wear the cross
Religion killed the spirit now we're god-fearing
We're either blind or we act like we don't hear it
I told you before beware of the false prophets
The plan will finish us all if we don't stop it

[Verse 4: Cynic]

Most of us know what they plot soon the military's gonna be the cops they call
Us l.a.'s hezbollah on the block
I welcome this new world government shit
I accept chips stacked sick but not them micro kids
Man I'm a psycho my life's a cycle of past generation
Incarcerations makes life so ice cold phones been tapped always under
Surveillance I utter enslavement
For strange days await the faceless
If we willing we would stop the killing we far from chillin
But really holmes check at the end who's winning
At last maybe that day will come but until then all
I see is pain for some

[Hook]
