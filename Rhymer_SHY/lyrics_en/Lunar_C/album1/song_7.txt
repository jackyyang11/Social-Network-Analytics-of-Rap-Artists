[Verse 1]
Jump in the booth
Too high and read my bars wrong
Tryna leave my mark on the planet like I'm Neil Armstrong
Groupies in rockets tyrna reach my hardon
Looking down the camera like I'm finally a star mum
I'm sick of arseholes critiquing how i craft my verses
Suck your grandads dick for a bag of werthers
You lack in purpose complaining that I'm perverted
Im just saying how i stuff and mount the pussy like a taxidermist
You crossing jobs with a tippa is bad luck
I'll slap the fringe off a hipster and piss on his fans Vans pumps
Pussy I'm your new step dad and there's a couple set rules
You call me out i call you in and send you to your bedroom
Run home before you get a clip round loghole
Im Killing these cats like them weird kids in Gummo
Make 'em jump like they got a stub toe
Blunt smoke but I'm bogeyed like Columbo BUH!

[Hook] x2
Lazy Bud bunnin' gobshite
If you ain't paying me don't expect me to be on time
Wake up after two in the afternoon slob life
I be on my sofa chonging till I'm bogeyed

[Verse 2]
I'm not just another idiot acting like im a thug being labeled
Has got me feeling that i should try and give up
I fantasize about putting my pad of rhymes in the dustbin
Just to fuck up my career that's my appetite for destruction
I did too much to add to prior discussion
I'm twisted and my idea of paradise is disgusting
There's only really a bag of rhymers i fuck with
And every time i unzip it to have a cypher they look stiff
You lot are burning the candle at both ends
You being so arrogant and so whack it makes no sense
I'm tryna figure out how you balance your own head
With the size that it's growing to without having a broke neck
Smoking till I'm brain dead
And don't have any common sense
I'm on my grizzly i was broke but now I'm on the mend
You tag a longs are too slow you couldn't comprehend
This is project fuck a poser we don't follow trends

[Hook] x2
