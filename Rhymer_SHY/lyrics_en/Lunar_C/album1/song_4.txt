[Intro]
And now the widely anticipated
THE LUNAR CD!
THE LUNAR CD!
(Rapping in background)

[Verse]
It's Lunar C
The MP my crews elite
I'm 19
You're half the man I used to be
Usually I'm either high I'm or I'm pissed
I'm so retarded that I write with a lisp
No one's as grimey as this
I punch your grandma in the spine for a fix
I got your wife in my crib
Ridin' my dick for a line and a cig
Personally I prefer a pint and a spliff
My favourite meal is vagina and chips
Minus the chips
You'll get tied up and whipped
With a vertical slice in your wrist
If you try to resist
For chattin' dog shit
I'll attach your chin to your top lip
With a cross stitch
Creep up on your blind side and lob bricks
I hold a shite rhymer hostage
I write like I've lost it
I'm fly like a crotch zip
Maybe to some the fact that my flow is fresh as a bird
And I'm that rapper you'll give props to but not respect as a person
Take the piss you'll be showin' your open chest to a surgeon
After I send a fist for your solar plexus and sternum
If you're married to the game you should get divorced
Coz she's a desperate whore
A dirty sket I caught her septic sores
These days I sleep alone next to a chest of drawers
Full of ket to snort
By night I ride a headless horse
And spend my time molesting dwarfs
And directing porn for leprechauns
Rest assured
I'm not mad I just forget the laws
When I'm stressed or bored
I jet to morgues
And sex a corpse
If I had less remorse
Then I'd probably be on a mental ward
Fuck fresh lyrics
I've got a foisty flow
It's explicit
I make visits
To sex clinics
Because there's skets in it
I get digits and bounce before my test's finished
You should feel honoured that you get to enter
The epicentre
You're blessed to venture
Into the mind of a mental member
Stroke sex offender
Bad breath from the last time that I ate placenta
If you're from the north west I'm meant to represent ya
Start the Lunar session
I'm so skillful I abuse progression
Now I have to either to take a new direction or improve perfection
