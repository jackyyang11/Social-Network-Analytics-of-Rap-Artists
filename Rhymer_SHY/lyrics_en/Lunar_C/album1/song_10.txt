[Verse 1: Lunar C]
Yahw... Lunar C!
Yo!
Whether it's a stand on my diddick
Or fags ranting like bitches
Everyone's either a fan or a critique attracted to gimmicks
Don't worry if I left the tag on my fitted cap it's just image
I've got the receipt about to take it back in a minute
They think coz I ain't always positive
I'm rapping bout the wrong stuff
And I only talk about smoking weed
Or getting my cock sucked
Pussy keep your gob shut
Or you're gonna be a concious rapper with your concussed
I signed a deal with myself and it's set in stone
I don't watch these gossips like episodes of a petty soap
My life's a movie, everyone but me's an extra so
I ain't quittin' till them motherfuckin' credits role
They're just a bunch of scared fake G's
With their brain schemes
And still had the bare faced cheek
To dare hate me
You're a joke go and FUCK yourself
And anyone who helped your head
Grow to the point you couldn't tell

[Verse 2: Jack Flash]
What every idiot with an opinion continues to share it
I don't sit and pretend that I'm interested in their shit
I just get up and walk outta the room
And if in an hour or two
I come back and he's still talkin'
I'll knock him out of his shoes
So thank you for coming but thank you more for leavin'
You boring me and you fuckin' slow like a tortoise breedin'
I'm torn between the peace and the violence
So don't be the least bit surprised
If I beat you, black out and completely deny it
Each of these eejits are easy to figure out
These dickheads think the shit that they spout
Literally counts
When it doesn't
And not for nothing
They're just a drop in the ocean
But they constantly moanin'
About how nothing is dope
And if they just stopped for a moment
And took a step outta the box they were closed in
They'd see their minds a lock
They're not gonna open
If they don't give someone some props as a token
It's gonna cost them their soul and
All of this hate is gonna stop them from growin'

[Chorus: Lunar & Jack]
So call me what you want
Call me what you wish
I call it down the middle
You should it quits
If you call me out
I just call you bitch
Then I call your bitch
And she call in sick
Home alone on some Macaulay Culkin shit
She call it amazing
I just call it dick
On alcoholic tips
All I hear recalling it
And you don't do fuck all I just call it how it is

[Verse 3: Lunar C]
Spiteful geeks gunnin'
While my teams hustlin'
We're tryna be somethin'
While you mean mug it
They talk about your music and tell you they think it's fresh
Then go and disrespect you on the internet
Sick of gettin' hounded for collabo's from rappers I won't cypher with
When they meet me they act like they've waited their whole life for it
I know why they're shit
But don't ride my dick
I get the beat tell them it's ill and they won't write to it
The fact you only know me as a battler's fustratin'
I've done a couple but I've been rambling on stages
And smashing it for ages
Oh, so apparently I'm hatin'
Cuz my personality's abrasive
That's only coz I run round of the city shoutin'
"BRADFORD!" in their faces
Somebody call the police
I'm drunk and disorderly
Frontin' and causin' beef
Any tenner penny rapper gets headbutted for talking brute

[Verse 4: Jack Flash]
And I'm quit givin' a shit bout how others feel
Fuck em' all
They said there's no way I could appeal
The can suck my balls
Just coz I'm from Huddersfield
That means that I'm stuck up north?
Never get a fuckin' deal?
Never get no club support?
Never get no radio play
Those ain't on no Maida Vale
No major labels
No J-Lo hook
No say those
No way Jose
Yo!
It's just the same old same old
You couch potatoes
Only ever stay home
Never play the game but love to commentate though
Suffering Suckatash
Pucker' up and suck my shaft
You'll never see me comin'
Like nuttin' in a bubble bath
I used to be humble that
Never got me anywhere
Like tryna fuck with a girl who was frigid as December air
You can see my temper flare
Temple tearing out my head
You're way too tender to contend
When the temperature's in the red
So instead of running your mouth
Run in your house
Quit speculating on shit you know nothing about

[Chorus: Lunar & Jack]
So call me what you want
Call me what you wish
I call it down the middle
You should it quits
If you call me out
I just call you bitch
Then I call your bitch
And she call in sick
Home alone on some Macaulay Culkin shit
She call it amazing
I just call it dick
On alcoholic tips
All are here recalling it
And you don't do fuck all I just call it how it is
Call how it is...
How it is...
