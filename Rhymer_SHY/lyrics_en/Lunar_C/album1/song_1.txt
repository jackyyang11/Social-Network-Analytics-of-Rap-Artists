[Hook]
Trade in my soul
I'm a slave to that dough
Fuck it, pay me
I don't want no fame
I'm on a low budget
Make what I own
Get out my face
I don't owe nothing
Trade in my soul
I'm a slave to that dough
Fuck it

Thousand bitches, thousand bitches [x8]

[Verse 1: Lunar C]
Girls everywhere, I'm tryna take a couple of 'em home
Sailor Jerry's got me slurring like a motherfucker though [?]
A thousand bitches, quick put them in a row
I've gotta be up in the morning to shoot a fucking video
Nah, I can never fuck a thousand bitches
Cause I always fucking cum in about 6 minutes
But I get the job done, don't doubt it
Mr. Fantastic, Stretch Armstrong, Dhalsim did it
Bitch I ain't swapping digits
My mind stay on my business
I ain't misogynistic, I've just got a lot of bitches
Been everybody's demons
Now I'm seeking my inner peace
I want five Latin wives and three from the Philippines
I just hope I don't die before they legalise weed and polygamy
[?]
I'm starting to get a hard-on
She said "what? I beg your pardon?"
I said "bitch, are you retarded?"
"What you doing in the V.I.P with all these artists? You ain't talent scouting, you want hard dick"
Although I'm ugly somehow I got women
Don't want me? I'm putting it down to my lyrics
I jump in the crowd and they gripping my penis or ripping my jeans, I've got hundreds and thousands of bitches
