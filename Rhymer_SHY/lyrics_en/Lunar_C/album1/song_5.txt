Yo, yo
Lunar C, Ballzee
Lunar C is an arrogant prick but I doubt you can prove to me I'm not the illest around

Yeah, tell me something I don't know bro
When man touch the mic, their bars don't match up to mine, cut 'em off like no, no, no

Turned up to the clash too drunk
But you ain't gotta ask who won
Bucked him with my cap on back-to-front
I wasn't in a bad mood but
Some of you fuckboy MCs act too tough
I should just slap you up
Stand over you like "Have some of that you mug!"
Have some of that you mug, yeah have some of that
Have some of that you cunt
Have some of that you cunt, yeah have some of that
Have some of that you cunt
Have some of that you cunt, yeah have some of that
Have some of that you cunt
Have some of that you cunt, yeah have some of that
Have some of that you cunt


Yo, eyes slanted, I can't walk properly, I'm too high, damn it
Plus I'm pissed I've been drinking spirits neat out of pint glasses
Wake up in the afternoon and start again, my life's tragic
But I still draw girls like DiCaprio on the Titanic
Peek through your window, it looks quite homy and cosy
But your mum looks quite lonely
If she wants me to come round, phone me
I wanna be your step-dad for one night only
If that chain on your neck isn't fake, I will take that to Cash Generators and pay off our debts
Yeah, Jake is a mess
Top 5 and I ain't even dead
But pay your respects

Turned up to the clash too drunk
But you ain't gotta ask who won
Bucked him with my cap on back-to-front
I wasn't in a bad mood but
Some of you fuckboy MCs act too tough
I should just slap you up
Stand over you like "Have some of that you mug!"
Have some of that you mug, yeah have some of that
Have some of that you cunt
Have some of that you cunt, yeah have some of that
Have some of that you cunt
Have some of that you cunt, yeah have some of that
Have some of that you cunt
Have some of that you cunt, yeah have some of that
Have some of that you cunt

Yo, no biting sound, I like skets strangled in my cypher
How do you like them apples
Have some of that, yeah have some of that
You're stupid if you think I'm gonna back down
No code of ethics, show no respect
Don't give a fuck about what postcode you rep
Your flow don't impress me
Go home, you're dead
Your donkey's punches go over heads
I’ve been keeping my ears open
And there definitely ain’t anybody who’s levelling with me
That's why I don't fear no one
One step ahead of my enemies
How can anyone compete
A lot of you have been begging a deal for years
Wondering how I got this far without one
Pound for pound, dumb MCs get outdone
The outcome is you wanna [?] for round one

Turned up to the clash too drunk
But you ain't gotta ask who won
Bucked him with my cap on back-to-front
I wasn't in a bad mood but
Some of you fuckboy MCs act too tough
I should just slap you up
Stand over you like "Have some of that you cunt!"
Have some of that you cunt, yeah have some of that
Have some of that you cunt
Have some of that you cunt, yeah have some of that
Have some of that you cunt
Have some of that you cunt, yeah have some of that
