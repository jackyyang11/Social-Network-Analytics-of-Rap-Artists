Yeah, I'm a bozo, I'm a motherfuckin' bozo

[Verse 1: Lunar C]
I'm a bozo
I want a mobo
And some coke so
I can make a fuckin' snowglobe
If there's a line I overstepped it by miles
On April fools day I went on Jeremy Kyle
And accused my grandma of molesting a child
They said I had to tone it down to make it mainstream
But that really ain't me
I'm ADHD
And all this grade I blaze means
I developed Alzheimer's at the age of 18
I puke my drink on the ground for them lost Tippas
Who are not with us
Tryna get wavy off some non drowsy cough syrup
Yeah
Teacher used to send me home 'cos I looked red eye
Never got grounded or even had a bedtime
I packed a plastic catapult and a pen knife
And stole dust caps off cars for my BMX bike
'cos I'm a weirdo
Eight mil pierced hole in my earlobe
I be gettin' ID'd for ciggies 'till my beard grows
I'm a bozo

[Hook: Lunar C & Minas]
I'm a bozo
Thoroughbred knucklehead
A don at this rap thing my real life's a fuckin' mess
Yeah, I'm a bozo, I'm a motherfuckin' bozo

Yeah, I'm a bozo
Thoroughbred knucklehead
A don at this rap thing my real life's a fuckin' mess
Yes, I'm a bozo, motherfuckin' bozo

[Verse 2: Minas]
Time is irrelevant in the life I live
I haven't been to bed yet if I'm up at 6
If you see me at nine you either got the time wrong
Or it's the day that I gotta sign on
No change
Ray Bans, spray tans, cocaine
Rain man, game plan, gold chain
Minas AKA no way, Jose
I make a hoe say
Okay!
On the first day
I'm in the club with a cup of earl grey
Stay drunk 'till I'm at them pearl gates
Girls say I'm the trillest around
They on the bozac
Swagger like a million pound
But got low cash
I'm in the middle of town with some old gash
Ya boy's still dippin' around with my broke ass
Little to no class
Still couldn't give a flying fuck
In the club
Buying shots
Tippa I'm a boss
I got solid gold balls and a designer cock
I ain't beating round the bush I'm inside the box
Twice as hot
As my Jap's eye when I'm pissing
You know I stay fly when I'm tipping
I'm that same old drunk guy
Dub-Y
Thug life
That's right
Bitch West Yorkshire
Where we stay swiggin' that fish tank water
I just made a six grand order
Fully stocked
Black gloves
Black hoodie, what
They say the whiter the grape then the sweeter the juice
I got the black ski mask and I'm out for the loot
Bozo

[Hook: Lunar C & Minas]
