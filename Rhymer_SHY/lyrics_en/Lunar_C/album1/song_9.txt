[Intro]
Uh, Lunar C
Buh

[Hook]
Breakdown, rebuild
Drink up, refill
Drop out, so what?
Life ain't 'bout shit
We roll 'round, blow weed smoke out of the sun roof
Lookin' like a steam train on the road
Crush your ego
Don't be so proud pussy, fuck you
So cold the devil doesn't want my soul

[Verse 1]
Rappers out for their gold teeth
Suck the crows feet of an old G
You can find me with the coke fiends
Lookin' all pale with a nose bleed
'Bout to walk in to the bank
With a sawn off shotgun in my hand
Walk in broke, walk out richer than Branson
If not, I'm going out this bitch with a bang (Aaah)
Let's take this fight outside
Start spazzing out, gouge out eyes
Rep Tipper Gang upside down fly
Un-fuck-with-able, you can find out why
Not grime, but I'm ill on a 140
Took a slag home, she asked what I want for tea
Steak and a blowjob, make her suck raw meat
Then pass her round your local football team

[Hook Part 2]
We roll 'round, blow weed smoke out of the sun roof
Lookin' like a steam train on the road
Crush your ego
Don't be so proud pussy, fuck you
So cold the devil doesn't want my soul

[Verse 2]
Cryin' like I never had shit because I didn't
But it ain't all so bad
Told me to work hard and don't hold back
Bad memories make sure I won't go back
I be pissed up in the street with my face painted and my top off screaming out mayday
Looking like Prince Naseem in his hayday
Bitch [?] never been on my A-game
Can't test me, there is no point
Front row tickets make your bitch go moist
Got dipset on, make her sing Oh Boy
In the bedroom where the springs go boing
Just roll up a jumbo zog and mind my business
Don't trust no one
These sluts don't love me
But they'll blow my dick and suck both nuts because they think I could blow up

[Hook Part 2]
We roll 'round, blow weed smoke out of the sun roof
Lookin' like a steam train on the road
Crush your ego
Don't be so proud pussy, fuck you
So cold the devil doesn't want my soul

[Verse 3]
No point to my logic, got them soiling their boxers
Think I ran out of tablets, missed my appointment at the doctor's
Just woke up, ate my Weetabix
Took some 'roids and then I just lost it
Knocked my neighbour out in his front garden and told his little boy that he's adopted (Aah)

[Hook Part 1]
Breakdown, rebuild
Drink up, refill
Drop out, so what?
Life ain't 'bout shit

[Verse 4: Lunar C]
You rap backwards, that's a par, write it down bitch
For me that was an average bar, but I just made it sound sick

[Hook Part 2]
We roll 'round, blow weed smoke out of the sun roof
Lookin' like a steam train on the road
Crush your ego
Don't be so proud pussy, fuck you
So cold the devil doesn't want my soul

[Hook][x2]
Breakdown, rebuild
Drink up, refill
Drop out, so what?
Life ain't 'bout shit
