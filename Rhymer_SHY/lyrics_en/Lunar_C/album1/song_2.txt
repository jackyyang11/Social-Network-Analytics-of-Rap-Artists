[Verse 1]
I do what I wanna do
There's always gonna be somebody bitching 'cause I'm winning but that's nothing new
I don't fuck with none of you
I use your career as a guide of what not to do
Let me spaz on this shit, go schizo'
Until I blacked out like limo windows
So let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole fistful of Rohypnol
That never knew God flow
Give your wife the taekwondo power thrust, thousand hit combo
Living like I lost soul, call me John Doe
Woke up in the garden, don't remember how I got home
Tell your girl there's no point in waiting
I just wanna hit it like an annoying face
And I never wanted to destroy the game
I was tryna climb the ladders and avoid the snake

[Bridge]
I decided that I've gotta get this money and I never looked back
If anyone can do it, it's me, if you can do it then anyone can
Everybody's rapping about trapping now
Everybodys talking bout selling drugs man
I went to hell and shook hands with the devil and sold him that 21 grams

[Hook]
That 21 grams
Bag it up, three quarters, thats 21 grams
That 21, 21 grams
Bag it up, three quarters, thats 21 grams
That 21, 21 grams
Bag it up, three quarters, thats  21 grams
21, 21 grams
Bag it up, three quarters, thats 21 grams

[Verse 2]
Why you always moaning like 'Why do all these rappers have gold chains?'
'And why ain't rap like it was in the old days?'
Make me wanna grab a sawn off and go crazy
Two barrels both aimed at my own face
Close range like I'm Cobaine
Nike SB everything but I don't skate
I'm glad I realise if I'm gonna make it
Then I gotta stay away from sneeky bitches and cocaine
Passed out in the VIP
And I think I threw up on my white-T
I just want a bottle and a rider
An some money I can split with my team
I wish I knew everything I knew now
Back when I was young and naive
I just hope that if I ever have a daughter she dont
Ever meet nobody like me

[Bridge]
I decided that I've gotta get this money and I never looked back
If anyone can do it, it's me, if you can do it then anyone can
Everybody's rapping about trapping now
Everybodys talking bout selling drugs man
I went to hell and shook hands with the devil and sold him that 21 grams

[Hook]
That 21 grams
Bag it up, three quarters, thats 21 grams
That 21, 21 grams
Bag it up, three quarters, thats 21 grams
That 21, 21 grams
Bag it up, three quarters, thats  21 grams
21, 21 grams
Bag it up, three quarters, thats 21 grams
