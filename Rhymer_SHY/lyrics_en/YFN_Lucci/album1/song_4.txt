When I come get my shit, it better add up
First I was hustlin' backwards, it didn't add up
Aye, being broke wasn't fun, thought it was bad luck
I heard it didn't make sense if it didn't add up
I might pull up on her soundin' like a panther (yeah)
I swear all my life I ain't have nun
I spent all my nights tryna make it add up
I know this ain't  right, shit gotta add up

[Verse 1: Lucci]
Okay, this rollie on my wrist say it's my time now
Louis V frames to block the pain in my eyes now
Of course I'm high right now
Still a blow a 10 you better pipe down
They keep asking me Lucc how you feel?
Can't believe it's real, finally got a deal
What's the deal? Gotta keep it real
Tryna make a mil, a couple mil
Had to tell em chill
I swear all this damn pain got me poppin pills
These niggas act like they'll do it but then they won't
It's in the hood, but at the trunk
You know I'm good with the pump
I promise to god I'll hit his ass and I ain't talkin tunk
A young nigga I had to grind to do what I want
Yeah yeah

[Verse 2: Lucci]
Uh, what is this nigga?
You know that hublot on ya wrist, it don't exist nigga

In that panamera porsche with ya bitch nigga
Did I mention I'm makin six figures?
They say change come when money come
Wonder if they still gon love me if all my money gone
They say they with me but don't know a song
Ain't it funny how them suckas gone
Yeah yeah
