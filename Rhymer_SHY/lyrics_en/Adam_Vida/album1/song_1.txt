Yeah, latency down, yeah

[Pre-Hook]
So, I brush my teeth, scrub my face
A condom and a pack of gum, just in case
I got a little bit of shine, not enough to waste
But I still sprinkle some up in a busta's face, 'cause

[Hook]
I'm juiced, throwin' up my elbows in the club
I'm juiced, throwin' up my elbows in the club
I'm juiced, throwin' up my elbows in the club
Everybody showin' love, everybody showin' love

I'm juiced, throwin' up my elbows in the club
I'm juiced, throwin' up my elbows in the club
I'm juiced, throwin' up my elbows in the club
Everybody showin' love, everybody showin' love

[Verse 1]
I was at the Russian River throwin' stones trippin' off the ripples
With my woman getting stoned water to her nipples
Luis called me on the phone
Said the afterparty lit and so I bounced up out the crib
Like I'm Tommy Pickles
See all of my doggies gon' eat all the bits and all the kibbles
Man, we cool as fuck, but you don't wanna make me call the pitbulls
You could never blend with my crew if you not official
But I keep my friends like my food
Nothing artificial
Aaron told me you could do whatever, so I got my issue
And now I'm lockin' up the game, but it's not Jujutsu
I made it past 25, glad I'm still alive
Rockin' these shows, but you say you'd rather stay inside
Bitch, you lied
Why
'Cause you still came out tonight
You got work tomorrow, but you still came out tonight
You got school tomorrow, but you still comin' out
If the party hella dry, I got something for the drought

[Pre-Hook]
So, I brush my teeth, scrub my face

I'm juiced, throwin' up my elbows in the club
I'm juiced, throwin' up my elbows in the club
I'm juiced, throwin' up my elbows in the club
Everybody showin' love, everybody showin' love

I'm juiced, throwin' up my elbows in the club
I'm juiced, throwin' up my elbows in the club
I'm juiced, throwin' up my elbows in the club
Everybody showin' love, everybody showin' love

[Verse 2]
I met a big girl and her skinny friend
One was named Lily Anne, one was named Lillian
One of 'em was 6 foot tall and one mini
But they both had a shirt too small to fit they titties in
A tight squeeze they rolled the bleez shit was called
"Red Congolese" some potent trees shit was strong
I coughed and wheezed and choked and sneezed then I turned
Hit the dance floor and broke my knees. If you heard
Adam's CD's you know the steeze very rare
All on the streets and overseas everywhere
You played it for your man and he hated it
90 degrees four corners, he's very square
I chase cheese flippin' packs I'm a pack rat
Drop a track make you wanna wiggle with your back fat
All the fly misses wanna kick it with the rap cat
Call me "big daddy" when you add me on snapchat
I just wanna spread love and unity
Everybody friends, we could all blend beautifully
The clothes comin' off, you could put down your purse
We gon' show up and show out to blow up, but first I'mma

I'm juiced, throwin' up my elbows in the club
I'm juiced, throwin' up my elbows in the club
Everybody showin' love, everybody showin' love

I'm juiced, throwin' up my elbows in the club
I'm juiced, throwin' up my elbows in the club
I'm juiced, throwin' up my elbows in the club
Everybody showin' love, everybody showin' love
