When it's love you give
[Sting]
I'll be your man of good faith
[Bryan Adams]
When it's love you live
[Sting]
I'll make a stand I won't break
[Bryan Adams, Sting]
I'll be the rock you can lean on
Be there when you're old
To have and to hold

When there's love inside
[Bryan Adams]
I swear I'll alway's be strong
[Rod Stewart]
And there's a reason why
[Bryan Adams]
I'll prove to you we belong
[Rod Stewart, Bryan Adams]
I'll be the wall that protects you
From the wind and the rain
From the hurt and the pain
Yeah

[Bryan Adams, Rod Stewart, Sting]
Let's make it all for one and all for love
Let the one you hold be the one you want
The one you need
Cause when it's all for one it's one for all
When there's someone that you know
Then just let your feelings show
And make it all for one and all for love

[Rod Stewart]
When it's love you make
[Sting]
I'll be the fire in your night
[Rod Stewart]
Then it's love you take
[Sting]
I will defend I will fight
[Rod Stewart]
I'll be there when you need me
And honor's at stake
This vow I will make

[Bryan Adams, Rod Stewart, Sting]
That it's all for one and all for love
Let the one you hold be the one you want
The one you need
Cause when it's all for one it's one for all
When there's someone that you know
Then just let your feelings show
And make it all for one and all for love

[Bryan Adams, Rod Stewart, Sting]
Don't lay our love to rest
Cause we could stand up to the test
We got everything and more than we had planned
More than the rivers that run inland
We got it all in our hands

[Bryan Adams, Rod Stewart, Sting]
Now it's all for one and all for love
All for love
Let the one you hold be the one you want
The one you need
Cause when it's all for one it's one for all
One for all
When there's someone that you know
Then just let your feelings show
[Rod Stewart]
When there's someone that you want
When there's someone that you need
[Bryan Adams, Rod Stewart, Sting]
Let's make it all all for one
And all for love
