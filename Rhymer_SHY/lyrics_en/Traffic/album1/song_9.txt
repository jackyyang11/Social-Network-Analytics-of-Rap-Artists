[Hook: Traffic]
Girl I know you really wanna fuck
Don't act like you don't, baby
Girl I know you really wanna fuck
Don't act like you won't, baby
'Cause I know you want it, 'cause I know you want it
'Cause I know you want it, so, baby, stop fucking with me
'Cause I know you want it, 'cause I know you want it
'Cause I know you want it, so, baby, stop fucking with me

[Verse 1: Traffic]
Hey look, girl, I know you wanna fuck
Yeah, I'm outspoken, [?]
And so what, let's smoke on a blunt
Buy another drink and go pose in the cut
No lust, no love, I just wanna fuck
If not, so what? You're lost, fuck off
Now I got her in the room with her clothes off
She rubbing on my back, says she like way I talk
I'm staring at the titties and the ass so soft
Look her in the eyes, [?]
[?], I'mma keep it 100
I beat that ass down, [?]
And it ain't gon' be the pills that's gon' have me running
And it ain't gon' be the liqour that's gon' have me running
It gon' be this long dick that's gon' have you cumming
It gon' be this long dick that's gon' have you running

[Hook: Traffic]
Girl I know you really wanna fuck
Don't act like you don't, baby
Girl I know you really wanna fuck
Don't act like you won't, baby
'Cause I know you want it, 'cause I know you want it
'Cause I know you want it, so, baby, stop fucking with me
'Cause I know you want it, 'cause I know you want it
'Cause I know you want it, so, baby, stop fucking with me

[Verse 2: TF]
Ah, why you frontin'
You looking like you think about fucking
So what you gon' do? You wanna get down?
We can party 'til the sun come out
We can go round for round 'til we both go out
Or 'til we both go out
Run it back on a wake up [?]
Call that the wake up show
Lemme eat your pussy while you tryna put your make up on
I'mma make you never wanna go home
Bitch, I'mma make you feel sexy
Wrap your legs 'round my neck, how you looking like a neck
Headgame right, she a left
Aiming at her face like selfies
Bussin' on your mind, I know you want it
Stop frontin' and get down on it
