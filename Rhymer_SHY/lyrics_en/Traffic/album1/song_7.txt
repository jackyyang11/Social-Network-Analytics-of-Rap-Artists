[Intro]
Damn, how you doin' lil' mama
You look so beautiful
You to fly, for me to let you walk by

[Hook]
So I had to talk to ya
You know, I had to talk to ya
You know, I had to talk to ya, like
You know, I had to talk to ya
You know, I had to talk to ya
You know, I had to talk to ya
You just to fly, just to let you walk by

[Verse 1]
So I had to talk to ya
I just want to talk to ya
I just want to talk to ya, sit and walk with ya, look
How you doin', my name is Traf, why you start laughing? 'Cause my hair? It look weird?
I ain't trippin', you know I don't care
Tell me where you going now and I can meet you there
I could bring a friend, you could bring a friend
We can get in, we can sit down in a house in Bronx
Laugh and chill, sit and get drunk
You know I ain't trippin', I ain't never frontin'
Always been a real nigga, kept it 100
Since you met me from the gate for real
You always talking that "let's just chill"

[Hook]
So I had to talk to ya
You know, I had to talk to ya
You know, I had to talk to ya, like
You know, I had to talk to ya
You know, I had to talk to ya
You know, I had to talk to ya
You just to fly, just to let you walk by

[Verse 2]
I'm looking for a woman that's gon' keep it real
And when it comes to it even hold my stealth
And if I get locked come and get me from jail
You know that shit, I would never tell
You my buddy, I'm your [?]
When I ride you ride
No dry rule, when I cry you cry
I tell you the truth, before I tell you a lie
And I rather die before I see you cry

[Hook]
So I had to talk to ya
You know, I had to talk to ya
You know, I had to talk to ya, like
You know, I had to talk to ya
You know, I had to talk to ya
You know, I had to talk to ya
You just to fly, just to let you walk by
