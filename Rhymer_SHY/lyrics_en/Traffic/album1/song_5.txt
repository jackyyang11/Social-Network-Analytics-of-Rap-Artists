[Intro]
Yeah
I see niggas is scary nowadays
They ain't no mans no more
They shoot you behind your back
They can't look a nigga in his eyes before they do it, shit
Put on a ski mask or somethin', I don't need one for you

[Hook]
I don't need no ski mask, nigga (what the fuck for?)
I don't need no ski mask, nigga (what the fuck for?)
I don't need no ski mask, nigga (hell nah)
I want you to see my face before I burn
I don't need no ski mask, nigga (what the fuck for?)
I don't need no ski mask, nigga (fuck that)
I don't need no ski mask, nigga (hell nah)
I want you to see my eyes before I pop

[Verse 1]
I don't need no ski mask, can't you tell he mad
I hop out like men on fire
Shootin' out windows and bussin' out tires
You tell me who hotter
Nigga, fuck the devil, nigga, I'm hot like [?]
Can't you tell, nigga, by the fire in my eyes
They got a nigga hot tryna shoot me in my back
Damn, what type of niggas is that
Can't look me in my face, motherfucker, not a man?
I don't understand, you niggas think I'm playing?
I'm bare back as shit, nigga
No gloves, no mask, blank face
Shoot a nigga in his face, bet I beat the case
That's a cold case, closed case
First 48, no talking
Can't tell on myselfs, that's a closed coffin

[Hook]
I don't need no ski mask, nigga (what the fuck for?)
I don't need no ski mask, nigga (what the fuck for?)
I don't need no ski mask, nigga (hell nah)
I want you to see my face before I burn
I don't need no ski mask, nigga (what the fuck for?)
I don't need no ski mask, nigga (fuck that)
I don't need no ski mask, nigga (hell nah)
I want you to see my eyes before I pop

[Verse 2]
As I walk up to the cash they be like 'look at this bastard'
He thought I was a motherfucking joke
He thought I wasn't gon' come back
He thought I wasn't gon' smoke ya, now look at you, joker
You're [?], hug his mom
And shake hands with his pops
Gave his sister this, gave his brother hug
[?], walked off with a little mud
Like shit, had to put him in the mud
He must've been off them drugs
Try to leave me stealthy
You try to leave me [?]
Holdin' onto [?]
Damn, [?], that's stupid as fuck
I'm like 'I thought we had love'

[Hook]
I don't need no ski mask, nigga (what the fuck for?)
I don't need no ski mask, nigga (what the fuck for?)
I don't need no ski mask, nigga (hell nah)
I want you to see my face before I burn
I don't need no ski mask, nigga (what the fuck for?)
I don't need no ski mask, nigga (fuck that)
I don't need no ski mask, nigga (hell nah)
I want you to see my eyes before I pop
