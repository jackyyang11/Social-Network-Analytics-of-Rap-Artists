[Intro: Dreebo]
I been waiting for it
Lord knows I been waiting for it
Lord knows I been waiting for it
Lord knows I been waiting for it

[Hook: Dreebo]
I been waiting for it
Lord knows I been waiting for it
Lord knows I been waiting for it
Lord knows I been waiting for it
But a nigga can't wait no more
But a nigga can't wait no more
Lord knows I been waiting for it
Lord knows I been waiting for it
But a nigga can't wait no more

[Verse 1: Traffic]
Can't wait no more, I been awake for a minute, nigga
I'm fresh out the pen, nigga
I'm already up and um, tryna get on my shit
Devil tryna knock me, God on my side
Niggas tryna pop while on my side
I keep a Glock and nine just in case i'mma die
I won't go out, nigga, you know how it go
All out, nigga, you know how it is
In the streets, nigga, ten toes down
When you walking in the field you don't live what I live
Just the other day a little nigga got killed, you don't even know how his mama even feel
Man, it's fucked up, man, the devil is real
You gotta keep you a steel, you gotta watch your back
I know you don't like that, but we under attack
Spiritual world, physical too
You don't know what to do
I suggest you [?], 'cause it ain't no stoppin'
Watch it

[Hook: Dreebo]
Lord knows I been waiting for it
Lord knows I been waiting for it
Lord knows I been waiting for it
Lord knows I been waiting for it
But a nigga can't wait no more
But a nigga can't wait no more
Lord knows I been waiting for it
But a nigga can't wait no more
But a nigga can't wait no more
Lord knows I been waiting for it
But a nigga can't wait no more
But a nigga can't wait no more

[Verse 2: Traffic]
I know you motherfuckers heard about Traffic
Word around town, man the devil got beef
I'm like "fuck it, let's eat"
[?]
Whatever you about, I'm about, I put that on god
You niggas is hot like [?]
I remember i didn't have shit, nigga
You niggas didn't have my back
You weren't winning the slot like that
But I was winning the [?] like that
For you you I'd catch a clap
That means the body
I'd do that for all my family

[Hook: Dreebo]
Lord knows the nigga couldn't wait no more
Just a young nigga tryna get this dough
Lord knows I been waiting for it
Lord knows I been waiting for it
I'mma have ask the world 'Is you ready for me'
I can make it happen, nigga, we don't see
Lord knows I been waiting for it
Lord knows the nigga couldn't wait no more
Just a young nigga tryna get this dough
Lord knows I been waiting for it
Lord knows I been waiting for it
I'mma have ask the world 'Is you ready for me'
I can make it happen, nigga, we don't see
But a nigga can't wait no more
