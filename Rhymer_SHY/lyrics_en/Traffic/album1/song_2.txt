[Verse]
Ha, I knew it
That brand new whip exclusive
Bitches on my dick, I got 'em bouncing to my music
Niggas hatin' on my grind, they be tryna do it
I'm like 'nigga, mind your own', that's how I do it
There's is nothin' to it but to do it, so just call me Nikes
Bitches on my dick and nigga they be tryna fight me
Homies always pull me over, they just tryna light me
Guess what, nigga, I ain't stoppin', I'mma keep on drivin'
Take me to the box, nigga, bet I keep on fighting
Niggas bitin' on my style, call it Tyson
I was born with the style that you can not get
And I only fuck with bitches that you can not hit
I see niggas out here spittin', they ain't hatin' shit
Niggas funny, niggas actin' like some little kids
Niggas scary nowadays that's why I keep the squad
Run up on me wrong, nigga, I bet you gettin' hit

[Outro]
Ha, ha, ha, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, ha
Ha, ha, ha, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, ha
Ha, ha, ha, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it
