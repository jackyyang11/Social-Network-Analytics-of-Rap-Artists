[Verse 1:]



Straight to my girl, you are my cyrus
Shining like a pearl, your beauty is like a virus
Other chicks look at you with nothing but envy
You leave guys huh with epilepsy
Stranger to a few, yet adored by many
When i look at you, i thank God for how He's blessed me
You're my best friend, and my worst enemy
I don't need meds, you're my only remedy



[Chorus:]


Girl i never smoke weed nor coke
And what i'm sayin' don't apply as a joke
But i can take you high
Let you chill in the sky
You're the Queen of my life
Someday you gonna be my wife [x2]

On the rise
Man this moment feels so right
Girl you know that i'ma do you right [x3]


[Verse 3:]



I just need your trust
I ain't after lust
Let's change from you and me, to us
Give you all need plus
Show you off lonke ikas'
If love is a verb
Then marryin' you is a must
Came in the game and they knew your name
You're like a house up in flames
That colourful picture in my brain
That circular motion of blood in my veins
Flip the page and show your rage
Thoughts of you on a rampage
Girl you always manage to leave my heart damaged
Talkin' to my homies they ain't understand
Even dictionaries failed to comprehend
High in the sky is how we supposed to be
Girl you and me are meant to be
Always need you here with me
Love - sick, i need you, like a remedy
Girl you're my wifey, just trust me
I ain't John Legend but i'ma give you all of me



[Chorus til' end]
