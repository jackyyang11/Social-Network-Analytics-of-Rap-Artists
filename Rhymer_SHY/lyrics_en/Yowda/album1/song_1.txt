[Hook]
Balling, all I do is keep balling
Balling, balling, all I do is keep balling
Balling, balling, all I do is keep balling
All I do is keep balling, all I do is keep balling

[Verse 1: Yowda]
Since day one, I’ve been moving A1
In the kitchen like ammo, doing service like Avon
Packs leaving out of Las Vegas, touchdown in Carol City
Got another 21 year middle height
King of the trap, come fuck with me
I’m ballin, niggas mad ‘cause they hatin
Mirror tint on that Ghost so haters could see the look on they face
Off bread and I ain’t
Go broke, I’ll never
You see me, I’m with the real niggas
In the convo's bout cheddar
Block master, spent 2 bricks on a yacht master
Movin Rosey at the KOD
Tryna see who can blow they knot faster
Louie all over my body, gold all over my neck
Bitches all on my dick, every time I fall away in some check
What’s happenin? Nothing here but this trackin
Play with my money and soul
Boy my patience screamin, it’s nothing


[Hook]


[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
My nigga pimpin hoes, you know life a bitch
Them pussy niggas broke, hatin like a bitch
I’m ballin out in Vegas, I done blew a brick
Cartier Rolls and the gold on the wrist
Ballin, all I do is keep ballin
Big deed on my beamer, all these bad bitches exotic
They say feds all on my tail, Rolls Royce on my cell
Half of it is kilos
I put the bitch on sell
I keep furs off, am I freezing?
Diamond rings on my finger
My main bitch had to bounce, my side bitch at the seasons
All I smoke is that west side
Lawrence Taylor, that left side
80 racks in my hublot, vin a car, they coolo
Rich nigga my dinner, choppa still in my Benz
Double M be the empire
Bitch, 100 M’s


[Hook x3]
