[Verse 1]
First the money carry in
Then the bitches follow
Two hunnid thousand, just to hit the throttle
Bad bitch with me think she mulato
She only fuck with me cause I look like I done hit the lotto
Young D-boy no act nigga
I’m really a trap nigga
All about a pack nigga
I don’t fuck with them rap niggas
Fuck a gun law I’m strapped nigga plus I’m a ex felon
Keep my circle tight cause the rest telling
Fuck a Samsung and a IPhone
I’m on them flip joints
Trap out the house for 60 days then I switch joints
She a bad bitch but I won’t save her
I know her behavior all she get is dick
She don’t get no favors

[Chorus]
I don’t do this for no fake niggas
This for my trappers only
This for my trappers only
This for my trappers only
I don’t fuck around with no snake niggas
This for my trappers only
This for my trappers only
This for my trappers only
I only do this for the real niggas
This for my trappers only
This for my trappers only
This for my trappers only
Cause half the time I don’t feel niggas
This for my trappers only
This for my trappers only
This for my trappers only

[Verse 2]
When it comes to Jewls and them pretty bitches
I’m a connoisseur
Yeah we both got Benzs mine is kinda newer
I’m packaging to get a package in
I suggest you come get it
Cause if I gotta ship it it’s go be a big price difference
From the crack of dawn now I’m night shifting
I got a nice flipping, these niggas getting money
I kinda like Memphis, I like the [?]
And I like Kansas City
And I like New Orleans
Big Riggs [?] trucks coming in but it don’t deliver oranges
Money made me more cautious
Only deal with them bosses
Tryna work smarter instead of harder
To recoup all my losses
My cousin need a lawyer
My niggas [?] need bail
And I’m selling these by the units
So I don’t need no scale

[Chorus]
I don’t do this for no fake niggas
This for my trappers only
This for my trappers only
This for my trappers only
I don’t fuck around with no snake niggas
This for my trappers only
This for my trappers only
This for my trappers only
I only do this for the real niggas
This for my trappers only
This for my trappers only
This for my trappers only
Cause half the time I don’t feel niggas
This for my trappers only
This for my trappers only
This for my trappers only
