KING YOWDA!
YOWDA!

[Verse]
I get money in my sleep pussy
All I know is money and that sweet pussy
A million dollar, what? Bitch shut the fuck up
You ain't had a key up in your Con'
You got some cheap pussy
Workin' at Chanel, man my bitch on
It ain't about no cash then my bitch gone
Nigga mad at me, but they both wrong
Why you call my bitch?
Why answering the bitch phone?
Fuck Louis, Gucci and some fucking Prada
I got seven bricks [?]
Shawty tee, I'm talking 'bout them gat niggas
Fuck buying clothes, we try'na stack this paper nigga
6 mile run, now we tella hassey
Tell them boys in Jacksonville want some work then come get at me
Universal try'na get me half a tick
But sold illegal when he pulled up with them 40 bricks
Trappin' on my mom, watchu thinkin' 'bout?
I pulled a dollar on these one if you bring 'em out
Front 'em to me and you get same day action
I'm try'na feed and get fed, I ain't really taxin'
All the homies they can come get them thangs that cost
If not I put a stack on 'em, get 'em or get lost
Them niggas hating on me, they call them people on me
I send them hittas in, I put the reaper on 'em
My bitch bad, a sucker prolly get her pregnant
I got her runnin' dope and cash out from Texas
Before me she was with a low life
Now you can't tell her shit 'bout this blow life
A hundred grand out the traphouse, pushin' chronic
Pull up, you get served somethin' like a sonic
Then I graduated to them out of state plays
Send it out to turn around, it's like [?]
