[Intro: M.I.A.]
Aye-a-a-aye

[Verse 1: M.I.A.]
M.I.A. you can wiki me, I don't be no dummenee
Dumbing me is killing me, like it can be that enemy
They come at me they gonna meet my people gonna cover me
The ones that govern me, ain't the ones that can power me
It's the sun and moon, that's turning me, if I get high it's burning me
You can kill my privacy, but you can't kill that love in me

[Chorus: M.I.A.]
It's a game can't be tamed, keep your fame and I'll keep my faith
(Oh yeah you can keep it)
Store my name, say my name, know my name, and I'll keep my faith
(I'm gonna keep it)
Light it up, turn em on, that’s when my powers gone
(gonna keep it)
I take em off, turn em off, and my powers on

[Hook: M.I.A.]
Aye-a-a-a-aye
Aye-a-a-a-aye
Aye-a-a-a-aye
Aye-a-a-a-aye

[Bridge: M.I.A.]
Pan 'em off, pan 'em, pan 'em off
Pan 'em off, pan 'em, pan 'em off
Pan 'em off, pan 'em, pan 'em off
Pan 'em off, pan 'em, pan 'em off

[Chorus: M.I.A.]
It's a game can't be tamed, keep your fame and I'll keep my faith
(Oh yeah you can keep it)
Store my name, say my name, know my name, and I'll keep my faith
(I'm gonna keep it)
Light it up, turn em on, that’s when my powers gone
(gonna keep it)
I take em off, turn em off, and my powers on

[Hook: M.I.A.]
Aye-a-a-a-aye
Aye-a-a-a-aye
Aye-a-a-a-aye
Aye-a-a-a-aye

[Bridge: M.I.A.]
Pan 'em off, pan 'em, pan 'em off
Pan 'em off, pan 'em, pan 'em off
Pan 'em off, pan 'em, pan 'em off
Pan 'em off, pan 'em, pan 'em off

[Chorus: M.I.A.]
It's a game can't be tamed, keep your fame and I'll keep my faith
(Aye-a-a-a-aye)
Store my name, say my name, know my name, and I'll keep my faith
(Aye-a-a-a-aye)
Light it up, turn em on, that’s when my powers gone
I take em off, turn em off, and my powers on

Pan 'em off, pan 'em, pan 'em off
Pan 'em off, pan 'em, pan 'em off
(Aye-a-a-a-aye)
