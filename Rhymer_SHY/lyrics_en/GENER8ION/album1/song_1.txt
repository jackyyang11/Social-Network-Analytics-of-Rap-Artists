Wake up in the morning
All systems on go
‘Cause I got goals and
I won't take no
For an answer
Got the grace of a dancer
The heart of a panther
I don't understand ya
If quits in your vocab
I cannot quote that
I want this so bad
I cannot go back
I cannot back down
I will not give up
You versus me huh?
I say good luck
You don't want this problem
‘Cause I don't do it unless I go full throttle
And I might throw it on the Instagram
Just to show you what the difference is
For instance, I'm up with the roosters
Out run the runners
Out shoot the shooters
Look in the mirror like
"Aye girl let's do this"
My only competition is myself
That's why I keep some trophies on my shelf
Never lazy ‘cause it's bad for my health
Da da ding da da ding
Bada boom bada bing
Now let's go!

Da da ding da da ding da ding
Let's go!

Da da ding da da ding da ding
Game on I'm ‘bout to do my thing
Guess who stepped in the ring
The last one left in the ring
Can't lose ‘cause I work too hard
Ab game like oh my God
Boss chick my pull up game is so sick
Don't think I lost it
I'm just getting started
Time to sweat
Another rep another set
Oh yeah!
Another lap another map
I'm about to turn up that dial

Da da ding da da ding
Da da ding da da ding
Da da ding da da ding
Da da ding da da ding

I'm in the gym making me proud
Then I'm on the track holding it down
Now, where my girls at?
Let's go hard and show the world that
Anything they can do we can do better
JUST DO IT…together
And fail is not part of the plan
But if I fall I'm going to stand again
Play hard ‘cause I ain't worried about getting a tan
I'm still just as beautiful, man
Da da ding da da ding
Bada boom bada bing
Let's go

Da da ding da da ding da ding
Let's go
