No, no, no, no
Mmm, mmm
Don’t go n' leave me
Don’t go n' leave me
Don’t go n' leave me yo
Mmm, mmm
No, no

I thought of leaving
I want the key
I wanted what
I want it all
I want to live
She got a grievance
She want the key
She want the key
She want the car
She want the crib

I got to admit it might be about that
My moves need to be about that
Body pullin' me to fuel you
Try to leave ya, but I still don't go

Even if I wanted to
I come back around
Even if I wanted to
I come back and we just go around, babe

Bang, bang, boomerang
Do you love or hate me now, babe
Bang, bang, boomerang
I can't believe it all began with a joke and champagne
I really never cared about it
If you plantin' or plantain

When you got me feelin' like boomerang
Boomerang Boomerang, Bang
When you got me feelin' like boomerang
Boomerang, boomerang, boomerang, bang

I got no need to pretend I know
I got no need to pretend I know
I got no need to pretend I know
She want key
She want the car
She want the crib

I might admit, it might be about that
My moves need to be about that
Body pullin' me to feel you are you
Try to leave ya, but I still don't go

Even if I wanted to
I come back around
Even if I wanted to
I come back and we just go around, babe

Bang, bang, boomerang
Do you love or hate me now, babe
Bang, bang, boomerang
I can't believe it all began with a joke and champagne
I really never cared about it
If you plantin' a plantain

I don't mind it bein' like

Boomerang
Boomerang, boomerang, bang
Doin' like boomerang
Boomerang, boomerang, boomerang, bang

Lookin' out of a window 'bout the things I knew
Lookin' out of a window 'bout the things I knew

Drinkin' my Seagrams
Got peace like we need friends
I look down and I need them
'Cause everything come back around, babe

Bang, bang, boomerang
Do you love or hate me now, babe
Bang, bang, boomerang
I can't believe it all began with a joke and champagne
I really never cared about it
If you plantin' a plantain

I don't mind it bein' like

Boomerang
Boomerang, boomerang, bang
Doin' like boomerang
Boomerang, boomerang, boomerang, bang
