[Verse 1]
I thought that I warned you about the woods
The pain they caused me, the life it took
Here you are, centered and stark
Sun shines through, lights you up
But just as it makes you warm and makes you feel special
It also drains you red just like the devil
I’m green just like the woods
You’re blue just like the ocean
Your colors drown mine out in one fluid motion

[Chorus]
I don’t want to be the one who corrupted you
Not you, my baby blue
Another devil on my back
The straw that will blow my stack
I know that you’re weary of me, careful of me
You don’t have to be afraid, don't be scared of me
(I know that you care for me, now and I care for you)
I know that you’re weary of me, careful of me
You don’t have to be afraid, don't be scared of me
(I never tried to corrupt you)

[Verse 2]
Oh no, no, not again
It claimed another
First it was my friends and now it’s my lover
I’ll burn these fucking woods
I’ll start the goddamn fire
Just to try and save you from the wolves that got you dire

[Chorus]
I don’t want to be the one who corrupted you
Not you, my baby blue
Another devil on my back
The straw that will blow my stack
I know that you’re weary of me, careful of me
You don’t have to be afraid, don't be scared of me
(I know that you care for me, now and I care for you)
I know that you’re weary of me, careful of me
You don’t have to be afraid, don't be scared of me
(I never tried to corrupt you)

[Outro]
Well, I guess that I was the one who corrupted you
And I guess that I have to come running back in
I’m gonna burn it down
I’m gonna burn it down
I’m coming in
