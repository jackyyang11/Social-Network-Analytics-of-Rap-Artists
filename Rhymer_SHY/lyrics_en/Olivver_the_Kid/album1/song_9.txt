[Verse 1]
When I was a young man
Younger than I am
I thought that I had it all worked out

As I grew up and
Started to love
My uncle told me that
Yeah he told me that you've got to

[Chorus]
Do the right thing
Do the right thing
Do the right thing
Do the right thing

[Verse 2]
When I am an old man
Much older than I am
I am, I am, I am
I am, I am, I am

I promise I'll look back in time with a smile
Take in every breath and every girl this time
Breathe in every rose and every night gone wild
Leave my whole life to tell the young kids you've got to

[Chorus]
Do the right thing
Do the right thing
Do the right thing
Do the right thing

Do the right thing oh
Do the right thing
Do the right thing
Do the right thing
