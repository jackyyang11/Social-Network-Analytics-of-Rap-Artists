[Verse 1]
Show me how, tell me how I
Can earn your love again
I watch your eyes as they light up
And they meet mine again
Catch a glimpse of our old flame
It turns back time again
Remember when we kissed in New York
I do

[Pre-Chorus]
Did we get lost before we had a chance?
Was it all right there in my hands?

[Chorus]
Fix me up, I wrecked our love
Haunted memories on my tongue
The taste of us is bitter
Don't let the taste of us be bitter
Follow me into the dark
Memories of us naked and stark
The taste of us is better
Don't let the taste of us be bitter

[Verse 2]
Let it out, tell me how I
Can make this right for you
Want to laugh in my bedroom
All tangled up with you
I've been trying to find us
Before we broke into two
How the hell did we get here
I don't know

[Pre-Chorus]
Did we get lost before we had a chance?
Was it all right there in our hands?

[Chorus]
Fix me up, I wrecked our love
Haunted memories on my tongue
The taste of us is bitter
Don't let the taste of us be bitter
Follow me into the dark
Memories of us naked and stark
The taste of us is better
Don't let the taste of us be bitter

[Bridge]
Fix me up, I wrecked our love
Haunted memories on my tongue
The taste of us is bitter
Don't let the taste of us be bitter
Follow me into the dark
Memories of us naked and stark
The taste of us is better
I won't let the taste of us be bitter

[Chorus]
Fix me up, I wrecked our love
Haunted memories on my tongue
The taste of us is bitter
Don't let the taste of us be bitter
Follow me into the dark
Memories of us naked and stark
The taste of us is better
Don't let the taste of us be bitter
Fix me up, I wrecked our love
Haunted memories on my tongue
The taste of us is bitter
Don't let the taste of us be bitter
Follow me into the dark
Memories of us naked and stark
The taste of us is better
Don't let the taste of us be bitter
