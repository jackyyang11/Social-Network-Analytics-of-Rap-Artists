[Verse 1]
I'm sick of the same people I see every night
The fake kisses, the fake friends, the fake fights
I wish someone would fuck or punch someone tonight

[Chorus]
Well give me something real
Show me what you feel, goddamn
Instead of comatose delight
Banana peel, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Showtime reel, electric eel

Is it real, or is it fake?
Or have I changed?

[Verse 2]
I'm sick of the same damn smile we wear just to save face
And fuck mirrors and fuck all my expiration dates
I wish that I could learn to just look away
Walk away

[Chorus]
Give me something real
Show me what you feel, goddamn
Instead of comatose delight
Banana peel, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Showtime reel, electric eel

Is it real, or is it fake?
Or have I changed?

[Bridge]
I'm getting older, I'm giving up
Bags under my eyes look bruised as fuck
I'm getting older, I'm giving up
There's lines on my forehead with eyes wide shut
I'm getting older, I'm giving up
I don't want anything from anyone at all
Just know I still love you
That's not fiction, that's fact
I can be a curmudgeon who overreacts

[Chorus]
Give me something real
Show me what you feel, goddamn
Instead of comatose delight
Banana peel, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Showtime reel, electric eel

Is it real, or is it fake?
Or have I changed?

[Outro]
Give me something real
Show me what you feel, goddamn
Instead of comatose delight
Banana peel, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Showtime reel, electric eel

Is it real, or is it fake?
Or have I changed?
