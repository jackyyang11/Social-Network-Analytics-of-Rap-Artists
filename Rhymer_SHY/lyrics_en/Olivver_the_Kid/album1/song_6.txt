[Verse 1]
I woke up singing your verses again
My voice is pitchy but it pays the rent
Sometimes my head is cloudy and something ain't right
And I can't feel nothing, so I sleep through the night

I'm dreaming a chorus, the hook is your name
I'm fishing for something or someone to blame
Sometimes I feel a pull or a push on my line
Wake up on ringing but I keep with this rhyme

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't want to be anyone else
Though I'm flawed
But I hope you can't tell
I'm not sure
What patience would do
For a man like me
The colour bruise

[Chorus]
I'm just damaged goods
Led you out of the woods
And into the light then
But I'd do it again
And if I could speak true
Beefheart, here’s an ode to you

[Verse 2]
Nothing is honest or naked or true
And I'm searching for something I'm bound to lose
Nothing is perfect or bearing of fruit
And I'm just my own selfish depressive muse

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't want to be anyone else
Though I'm flawed
But I hope you can't tell
I'm not sure
What patience would do
For a man like me
The color bruise

[Chorus]
I'm just damaged goods
Led you out of the woods
And into the light then
But I'd do it again
And if I could speak true
Beef heart here’s an ode to you
