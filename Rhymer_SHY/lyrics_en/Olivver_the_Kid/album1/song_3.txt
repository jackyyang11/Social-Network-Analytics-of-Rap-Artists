[Verse 1]
I’ve changed my mind about writing this song about…
I felt love in the strangest depths
Surrounded by evil & hate it crept
Through my body & through my soul
Into my mind & out of my pores
Left alone, or so the story goes
I felt what happened
In the truth I know

[Chorus]
Oh, the truth I know, the truth I know
Oh, the truth I know
Oh, the truth I know, the truth I know
Oh, the truth I know

[Verse 2]
My heads been filled with doubt
Emotions been running about
I felt love in the strangest way
I’ve been looking for a reason to stay through my pain into my soul
I’m out of my mind & I’m out of the door
I left alone, or so the story goes
I felt what happened
The truth I know

[Extended Chorus]
Oh, the truth I know, the truth I know
Oh, the truth I know
Oh, the truth I know, the truth I know
Oh, the truth I know
Oh, the truth I know, the truth I know
Oh, the truth I know
