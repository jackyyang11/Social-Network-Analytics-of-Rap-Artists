[Verse 1]
Looking back
I remember we were kids, alone
Entangled in
These beach towers
Just kids alone

[Pre-Chorus]
Time is passing
Every second counts, yeah

[Chorus]
Remember the time I
Drove around with you
Remember the time I
Know you felt it too

[Verse 2]
Looking back
I remember we were kids, in love
Wine-stained sheets and
Full of color
Kids in love

[Pre-Chorus, Variation]
Time is passing
Every second counts, yeah
Memories flashing
Like Polaroids

[Chorus]
I remember the time I
Drove around with you
I remember the time I
Know you felt it too
