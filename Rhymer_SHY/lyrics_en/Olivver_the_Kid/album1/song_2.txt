[Intro]
Come get me
You got me feeling unsteady
Waiting for you when you're ready
Annie, it's all in your time

[Verse 1]
Faded, I've become so jaded
Letters signed and dated
Hope it found you well
Darling, we stopped before we started
It's not your fault that I'm in
I'm in love with you

[Chorus]
Come get me
You got me feeling unsteady
Waiting for you when you're ready
Annie, it's all in your time
Come get me
You got me feeling unsteady
Waiting for you when you're ready
Annie, it's all in your time

[Verse 2]
I can't focus
Words are all to cope with
This way I feel, so hopeless
But it's still you on my mind
I can't pretend that I could let you go
And this melody I wrote
All these highs and lows for you

[Chorus]
Come get me
You got me feeling unsteady
Waiting for you when you're ready
Annie, it's all in your time
Come get me
You got me feeling unsteady
Waiting for you when you're ready
Annie, it's all in your time

[Bridge]
I'm waiting, hope I'm on your mind
Too vacant, sick of wasting time, time, time
I'm waiting, hope I'm on your mind
Too vacant, sick of wasting time, time, time
I'm really sorry again that I couldn't be there, alright...

[Chorus]
Come get me
You got me feeling unsteady
Waiting for you when you're ready
Annie, it's all in your time
Come get me
You got me feeling unsteady
Waiting for you when you're ready
Annie, it's all in your time
