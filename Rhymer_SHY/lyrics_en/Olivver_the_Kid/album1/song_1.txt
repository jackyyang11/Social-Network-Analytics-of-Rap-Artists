[Verse 1]
It's 4 o'clock in the morning
I can tell you're tired
It's 4 o'clock in the morning
You can tell I'm wired
You woke me up, I was moaning
And then you asked me
At 4 o'clock in the morning
"How often do these nightmares come?
Who are the wolves in your head?
How often do these nightmares come now?
You should let the past stay dead"
I said
"Babe, I'm trying"

[Verse 2]
It's 4 o'clock in the morning
You say my eyes look wide
You tell me, "Boy, I'm not joking"
Our campfire's burned out
Darling, you know you were groaning
I say that I'll be fine even
At 4 o'clock in the morning
You said
"How often do these nightmares come?
Who are the wolves in your head?
How often do these nightmares come now?
You should let the past stay dead"
I said
Babe, I'm trying
Babe, I'm trying
Babe, I'm trying
Babe, I'm trying

[Verse 3]
It's 4 o'clock in the morning
You know these aren't nightmares
I just want to warn you
About what got me bit
You say I'm scaring you sober
You think I lost my mind
At 4 o'clock in the morning
You said
"How often do these nightmares come?
Who are the wolves in your head?
How often do these nightmares come?
The past should stay dead"
I said
Babe, I'm trying
It's 4 o'clock in the morning
