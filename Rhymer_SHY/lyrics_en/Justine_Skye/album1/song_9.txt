[Verse 1]
Riding on the A train
Got you stuck on my brain
On the way to the city
Wanna leave you but you with me
Love on the wall like graffiti
Oh running from you ain't easy
Gotta read between the lines, cause

[Pre-Chorus]
I need the noise, I need it loud
I need the doors to shut you out
I need the people, I need the bad
I need a moment right now
I need the noise, I need it loud
I need the doors to shut you out
I need to breathe, I need to think
Only way I'm gonna do it is on this A train

[Chorus]
On the A train, yeah
A train, yeah, A train, yeah, catch me on the A train
On the A train, yeah
A train, yeah, A train, yeah, catch me on the A train
A train, riding on the A train

[Verse 2]
Lights are my therapy
Underground, yeah it's the remedy
I could stay as long as I wanna
Somehow this ride brings clarity clarity
I love you but I need some time
And the tracks help me just clear my mind
Don't take it personal
I just need a moment

[Pre-Chorus]
I need the noise, I need it loud
I need the doors to shut you out
I need the people, I need the bad
I need a moment right now
I need the noise, I need it loud
I need the doors to shut you out
I need to breathe, I need to think
Only way I'm gonna do it is on this A train

[Chorus]
On the A train, yeah
A train, yeah, A train, yeah, catch me on the A train
On the A train, yeah
A train, yeah, A train, yeah, catch me on the A train
A train, riding on the A train

[Outro]
Catch me on the A train, A train
Catch me on the A train, A train
Catch me on the A train, A train
