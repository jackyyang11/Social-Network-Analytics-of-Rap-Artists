[Verse 1: Justine Skye]
So I'm in love with a man, I don't care his age
He's been calling all the time but I don't know what to say
I don't wanna lead him on, but you know that I had no choice
I been tryna be strong, but baby you should here his voice
He be like, keep your calm now, keep your cool
Keep me coming yeah, flex me loose

[Chorus: Justine Skye]
Just over here been thinking lately, bout what you do
Touch me, tease me, caught in your vibe
Take me deeper, show me your mine
It's the anticipation, anticipation
Don't keep me waiting
I want it right now, I want it right now
It's the anticipation, anticipation
Don't keep me waiting
I want it right now, I want it right now

[Verse 2: Kranium]
She's in love with some man, I don't care about his age
But I'm a young boy with a [?] style
