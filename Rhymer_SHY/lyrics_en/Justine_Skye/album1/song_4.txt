Hey, hey, hey, heeyy
Hey, hey, hey
Let go, let go, let goooo
Let go

[Verse 1:]
So I peeped ya' status lookin' like
You feeling happy that you single
Tryna act like you ain't' hurtin'
When it's simple and clear
That boy you know you would rather be here
Tellin' all ya boys that you left me
When everybody knows you lyin'
But I see it in your pictures that 'cha crying inside
You know she not even half the girl that I am
Cause it's been

[Chorus:]
30 days, 30 nights since I lasted kissed you
30 days, 30 nights and I don't miss you
Almost forgot about it
You're hurting that I'm (?)
I see right through your bragging
So tell me I'm just asking
How you doing without me?
Cause I'm better without you
How you doing without me?
Cause I'm better without you
Better without you, better without you
How you doing? How you doing?
Cut it out, stop, it's ya lost
Cut it out, stop, it's ya lost
Cut it out, stop, it's ya lost
Cut it, stop, c-c-cut it out

[Verse 2:]
Who you think you fooling with subliminals
Boy you ain't fooling no one
So pathetic
You would think that it'd go over my head
It just make you look so stupid instead
Still sitting pretty, I'm officially the best you'll
Never have again
When you see me out with homie
Don't be mad at him
Cause I know that you still wishing
That you had my attention
And here's what you been missing for the
30 days

[Chorus:]
30 days, 30 nights since I lasted kissed you
30 days, 30 nights and I don't miss you
Almost forgot about it
You're hurting that I'm (?)
I see right through your bragging
So tell me I'm just asking
How you doing without me?
Cause I'm better without you
How you doing without me?
Cause I'm better without you
Better without you, better without you
How you doing? How you doing?

I would do it if it's better
And i'm doing it, I forget ya
I forget ya, I forget yaaaaa
Hey, hey, hey, heeey
Hey, hey, hey
Let go, let go, let gooo
Let go

[Chorus:]
30 days, 30 nights since I lasted kissed you
30 days, 30 nights and I don't miss you
Almost forgot about it (Almost forgot about it)
You're hurting that I'm (?)
I see right through your bragging
So tell me I'm just asking
How you doing without me?
Cause I'm better without you
How you doing without me?
Cause I'm better without you
Better without you, better without you
(Better without you!)
How you doing? How you doing?
Cut it out, stop, it's ya lost
Cut it out, stop, it's ya lost
Cut it out, stop, it's ya lost
