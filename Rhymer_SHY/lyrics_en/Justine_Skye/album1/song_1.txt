[Hook]
10 Bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it, man
Let's just not even discuss it, man
OMG, niggas sleep, I ain't trippin', I'mma let 'em sleep
I ain't trippin', let 'em rest in peace

[Verse 1]
I can tell ya how it happened
I can tell ya 'bout them crazy nights out in Calabasas
I can tell you tryna get a rapper
So you bust it open wide cause you think this nigga hot
Man I'm focused, I ain't fallin' off the grid
Hater bitches on the sideline talkin' out their lips
It ain't workin' baby, maybe you should quit
You can never take the crown cause the team is too legit mayne
Who you with, what you play?
Got a deal, made it real, I was only 17
And I know you see me in that magazine
My ex asked me, "Where you movin'?" I said, "On to better things nigga"

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I been in the crib with the phones off
I been at the house ain't taking no calls
Selling out shows, I got my shit goin'
EP dropping soon now watch that wrist motion
You ain't gotta tell me, know what time it is
Man I've been awake, I gotta shine this year
I could never ever let the streets down
Haven't left the stu for a week now
Week now, we-week now, week now

[Bridge]
I got enemies, got a lot of enemies (x8)

[Outro]
Are you gon' do uh
Yeah
"Shawty take the wave"
