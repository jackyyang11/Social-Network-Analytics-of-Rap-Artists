Oh tell me what you wanna do
And I'll do it to you
Philosophically touching me
In forbidden places, making faces
Boy stop playing
Never seen or heard a n*gga so smooth
Where'd you learn those moves? in the drop top swinging
And I know that you wanna be with me
But baby boy I'll tell ya that ain't easy
To win you gotta lose a little
If ya lucky Im'a show you how to solve my riddles
Oh you hold my body so tight
You know exactly whats right for me

[Chorus]
So let me know is there anything you wanna let me know boy?
Before I take you home, is there anything you wanna let me, let me know boy?
Let me know, is there anything you wanna let me, let me know?
Oh boy before I take you home
Is there anything you wanna let me know boy?

It's 2 O Clock in the morning time
You know I'm heading across the bridge bouta hit your line
Don't tell your homies they ain't gotta know
And I'ma hurry up cause I know that your moms ain't home
And I can tell that you wanna be with me baby
And you ain't gotta front cause I know what you need baby
We're living in a fantasy lets turn it to reality yeah
You can't fight the way you feel
So stop playing and give it all your love to me

[Chorus]

You can't fight the way you feel
So stop playing and give it all your love to me [x2]
