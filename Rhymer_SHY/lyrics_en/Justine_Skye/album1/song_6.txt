[Verse 1]
Boy you’re cute and I think you’re cool, but don’t fall, don’t be foolish
We’re not meant to be cause I’m somebodies one, I can’t do this
You keep callin, I keep ignoring, you know I know better
But get it through your head, I’m not leaving him no, no never

[Chorus]
I thought that you knew front he moment we met
I’m not gonna let you get into my head
You’re just another, another
You’re just another boy (2x)
I’m sorry if I led you on
So sorry if i wasted your time
You’re just another, another
You’re just another boy

[Verse 2]
I saw you and you saw me too, I’m not dumb, no I’m not stupid
What you seek you won’t get from me, I’m not yours, there’s no cupid
I thought we were on the same page maybe I, was too friendly
Don’t know what to say, I know your heart is full, but mine’s empty

[Chorus]
I thought that you knew front he moment we met
I’m not gonna let you get into my head
You’re just another, another
You’re just another boy (2x)
I’m sorry if I led you on
So sorry if i wasted your time
But you’re just another, another
You’re just another boy
Ooo, Yeah
You’re just another
You’re just another boy

(x2)
You’re just another, another
You’re just another boy (2x)
I’m sorry if I led you on
So sorry if i wasted your time
You’re just another, another
You’re just another boy

[Outro]
