[Verse: Big Scoob]
A weapon, tell the truth it's a blessing
One hundred proof in the booth ain't no guessing
I get down from the getting
Stay on my square, I'm a bear, don't upset him
Ain't no faking and jeffing
Rare end, I'm fair out, break bread with my brethren
If you need it I sell it
Dope fiends want 16s I ship it and mail it

[Hook: Big Scoob]
When dealing with niggas like me in the streets
Man there's one thing you gotta know
I'm not taking no shit, I don't trip off no bitch
I'm just focused on getting dough
You not taking nothing from me
Especially not no money
I got the stick on me
So please don't walk up on me
If you do not know me
I am the big homie

[Verse: Big Scoob]
Trapped in the struggle
Out in the rain, I'm in pain
Steady dodging these puddles
Hard to be subtle, stars on the brain
I'm insane got me aiming the muzzle
Piece in the puzzle
Slamming this liquour
I'm different, I'm banging my knuckles
Fuck yo rebuttal
