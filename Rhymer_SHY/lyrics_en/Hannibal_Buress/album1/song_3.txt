Im in the booth right now....
This not a booth. To be honest about this whole recording situation...
We're in Carroll Gardens... in one of Tony Trimm's friends bedroom
He's in the living room. He's working on... he's studying for law school and stuff
He's a good dude for letting us record here
Yeooon! I ain't got no shoes on, I'm comfortable!
Got a Bass in my left hand, yeah!
I ain't got no pen or no paper...i'm just rappin!
Rappin, rap rap rappin'
I'm rappin, rap rap rappin' (rap)
In my socks rapping (socks)
Got on my jeans (jeans)
Jeans, degrees put on deodorant
Soda shit, Whodepsit
