[Intro]
Yeah, what’s going on? It’s Hannibal Buress
Hosting Call It What You Want Part 3
I don’t know, why was I talking like this?
I think that it’s the sirens, that get you all hyped up
This is Roofeeo’s mixtape, Call It What You Want Part 3, we did it last year
We doin' it again
This that summer time music
This that “put your belly out even though you got a disgusting belly” music
I got a disgusting belly, I’m built like Gucci Mane
Yeah! Summer time!
Walk around, make horrible drinks
Stare at people! Wear shades so you can be creepier

[Freestyle: Hannibal Burres]
I don't need the music
The music needs me
Put on my shoes, freestyle to the beat
Y'all be jumping double-dutching in the street
When the blammers come out, 90 degrees is the heat
Karate in my feet, jujitsu in my fists
Hat on my head, liquor in my piss

[Outro]
Yo, that was Call It What You Want Part 3
This is Hannibal Buress
It's Roofeeo's mixtape
Hit me up on Twitter @hannibalburess
Roofeeo's @roofeeo
Instagram is the same stuff
I don't post that many pictures though
Call It What You Want Part 3
Did you decide what you wanted to call it?
I wanna call it Toastatos in Coney Island
I walk around in Coney Island with an island hat on: the hockey team
Coming through, some boxer squared up
He socked me in the face
I ducked but it was too late
My reactions ain't what they used to be
I went into school leg swept the janitor now they suing me
They pursuing me, it's the jew in me
I come through with the negotiations
I walk in to the arcade and I know they hate cause I'm the dopest at Street Fighter
Hit you with Ryu, hadoken hadoken, perfect
