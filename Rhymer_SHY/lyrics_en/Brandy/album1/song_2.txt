[Verse 1]
Ain't it funny how
Ain't it funny how
Things always come right back around
How the tables turn
With a little time
What once was up will soon be down
Got me thinkin' bout
What it was that made me
Think that you were oh-so-great
Had me sittin' 'round
Tryin' to figure out
What you thought was so wrong with me

[Pre-Chorus]
You treated me like I wasn't nothin'
Thought you were somethin'
You made it seem like Rocka wasn't that thing, uh-uh
Now you come a-knockin' and I was thinkin'
You almost had me for a minute, but I...

[Chorus]
On second thought, I'm alright
Don't hate 'cause I changed my mind
I thought that I wasn't workin'
Now look who's hurtin'
For a chance to be with me, you
On second thought, don't drop by
Think it'd be a waste of time
Remember you wasn't diggin' me
Now you so into me
On second thought, I'll say good bye
Bye bye bye, goodbye bye bye
Goodbye bye bye, good bye bye

VERSE 2:
If back then was now
Probably would have said "thank you Lord for sendin' him to me"
But I found out
That it was better to be hurt back then
'cause now it strengthens me
So now when you bounce
It was because I put you out, now you just needin' me
And now back around
Is it because I was okay when you're still strugglin'

[Pre-Chorus]
You treated me like I wasn't nothin'
Thought you were somethin'
Made it seem like Rocka wasn't that thing, uh-uh
Now you come a-knockin' and I was thinkin'
You almost had me fooled for a minute, but on second thought

[Chorus]
On second thought, I'm alright
Don't hate 'cause I changed my mind
I thought that I wasn't workin'
Now look who's hurtin'
For a chance to be with me, you
On second thought, don't drop by
Think it'd be a waste of time
Remember you wasn't diggin' me
Now you so into me
On second thought, I'll say good bye

[Bridge]
Why did I let you back into my life?
I would never turn back the hands of time
Some things are meant to just fade away
There's no way you could ever change everything you've done
Wouldn't matter to me, 'cause I moved on
Now I see somethin' better in my future

[Chorus]
On second thought, I'm alright
Don't hate 'cause I changed my mind
I thought that I wasn't workin'
Now look who's hurtin'
For a chance to be with me, you
On second thought, don't drop by
Think it'd be a waste of time
Remember you wasn't diggin' me
Now you so into me
On second thought, I'll say good bye

[adlibs]
I didn't have to be this way, but
Coulda had me anyway, but
You chose to do it
Don't know what made you do it
Now hurtin' without me, yeah yeah
Should have did me right before
Now I don't need you no more
It hurts me but I gotta say goodbye

[Outro]
Bye bye bye, goodbye bye bye bye
Bye bye bye, goodbye bye bye bye
Bye bye bye, goodbye bye bye bye
