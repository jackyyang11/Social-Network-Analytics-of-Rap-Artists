[Chorus]
Always on my mind
You're always on my mind
Thoughts of you all the time
You're always on my mind

[1st Verse]
Everyday I see ya with lovin' eyes
I just want to hold ya and make you mine
If you listen to me now, sweet baby
I'll make a promise that you can hold me too

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter how far and no matter how wide
I promise, baby that I'll stay by your side
Cause in my mind I see you
And I just can't seem to shake you
Your sweetness to me is worth not thinkin' of

[Chorus]
Always on my mind
You're always on my mind
Thoughts of you all the time
You're always on my mind

[2nd Verse]
It's the way you look at me
The sight of you knocks me off my feet
I wanna kiss and tell and get to know you well
Let me introduce my heart to you

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter how far and no matter how wide
I promise, baby that I'll stay by your side
Cause in my mind I see you
And I just can't seem to shake you
Your sweetness to me is worth not thinkin' of

[Chorus]
Always on my mind
You're always on my mind
Thoughts of you all the time
You're always on my mind

Always on my mind
You're always on my mind
Thoughts of you all the time
You're always on my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter how far and no matter how wide
I promise, baby that I'll stay by your side
Cause in my mind I see you
And I just can't seem to shake you
Your sweetness to me is worth not thinkin' of

[Chorus]
Always on my mind
You're always on my mind
Thoughts of you all the time
You're always on my mind

Always on my mind
You're always on my mind
Thoughts of you all the time
You're always on my mind
