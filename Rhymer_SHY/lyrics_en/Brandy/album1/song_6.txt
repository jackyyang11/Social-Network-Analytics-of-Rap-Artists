[Verse 1]
There's so much going on, you can think of me
When your hope is gone, you can think of me
To get through anything, you can think of me
I'm here as long as you need me
When nothing seems to work, you can think of me
Your heart is on a search, let it come to me
I'll make it all reverse when you think of me
Baby, you can see new life through me

[Chorus]
Let me be the reason you get through the day
Know that I'll make everything okay
Think of me, baby, in any way
I'll be all you need
Let me be the one you turn to when there's pain
Baby, I will take it all the way
Hide in me, I'll be your secret place
Cause it's all in me

[Verse 2]
When it seems no one loves, you can count on me
When pain is all too much, you can count on me
Need someone to trust, you can count on me
I'm here as long as you need me
When you see brighter days, know that it was me
Tears are wiped away, don't guess it, it was me
When you realize your pain was suffered too by me
Then you know the love in me

[Chorus]
Let me be the reason you get through the day
Know that I'll make everything okay
Think of me, baby, in any way
I'll be all you need
Let me be the one you turn to when there's pain
Baby, I will take it all the way
Hide in me, I'll be your secret place
Cause it's all in me

[Interlude]
4, 3, 4, 3, 2, step

[Bridge]
Anything you could ever need
Baby, I promise you can find in me
Don't matter if it's a hope or dream
I promise I could make it a reality
Nothing ever too much for you
Anything that's possible I will do to
Make it so so clear to you
Tell my love for you is more than true
Anything you could ever need
Baby, I promise you can find in me
Don't matter if it's a hope or dream
I promise I could make it a reality
Nothing ever too much for you
Anything that's possible I will do to
Make it so so clear to you
Tell my love for you is more than true

[Breakdown]
Everyday, every night
Break of dawn, air of night
Come to me, I'll make it right
If you let me, it's all in me
Everyday, every night
Break of dawn, air of night
Come to me, I'll make it right
If you let me, it's all in me

[Chorus]
Let me be the reason you get through the day
Know that I'll make everything okay
Think of me, baby, in any way
I'll be all you need
Let me be the one you turn to when there's pain
Baby, I will take it all the way
Hide in me, I'll be your secret place
Cause it's all in me
Let me be the reason you get through the day
Know that I'll make everything okay
Think of me, baby, in any way
I'll be all you need
Let me be the one you turn to when there's pain
Baby, I will take it all the way
Hide in me, I'll be your secret place
Cause it's all in me
Let me be the reason you get through the day
Know that I'll make everything okay
Think of me, baby, in any way
I'll be all you need
Let me be the one you turn to when there's pain
Baby, I will take it all the way
Hide in me, I'll be your secret place
Cause it's all in me
