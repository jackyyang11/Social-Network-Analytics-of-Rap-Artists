[Verse 1]
I'm feelin' such a vacancy, I don't feel whole, oh oh
Wish I could put my finger on it but I don't know what it is
Looked in every place I could see
Tryna find the missing part of me
I can't explain this feeling

[Chorus]
Feels like I'm on a long journey going in circles
And I ain't even goin' nowhere
I'm lost in the middle of nowhere
Something is missing (Can't somebody help me?)
Something is missing (I'm missing a part of me)
Something is missing (Show me what it is)
Show me what's missing

[Verse 2]
I'm in a dark room, in a bad position
I'm lookin' for the light to restore my vision
Guess I'm walkin' blind, I keep falling down
I can't find my way
I can't explain this feeling

[Chorus]
Feels like I'm on a long journey going in circles
And I ain't even goin' nowhere
I'm lost in the middle of nowhere
Something is missing (Can't somebody help me?)
Something is missing (I'm missing a part of me)
Something is missing (Show me what it is)
Show me what's missing

[Bridge]
Feels like I'm leavin' something behind
Can't think straight, something's on my mind
Can't pay attention cause I'm oh-so broke
Can't find the words cause they all been spoke
The answer's gonna be right in my face
What I gotta do to fill this empty space?

[Final Chorus]
Feels like I'm on a long journey going in circles
And I ain't even goin' nowhere
I'm lost in the middle of nowhere
Something is missing (Can't somebody help me?)
Something is missing (I'm missing a part of me)
Something is missing (Show me what it is)
Feels like I'm on a long journey going in circles
And I ain't even goin' nowhere
I'm lost in the middle of nowhere
Something is missing (Can't somebody help me?)
Something is missing (I'm missing a part of me)
Something is missing (Show me what it is)
Show me what's missing, oh
