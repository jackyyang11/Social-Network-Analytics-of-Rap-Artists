[Intro]
Hahah ha uh uh uh
Hahah ha uh uh uh
Hahah ha uh uh uh

[Verse 1]
My love for you goes beyond singin' it
I can only deliver it, clear it, or seal it
Like we be a deal
I wanna give it to you like a stripper to give it to
A nigga that claim me a mister and that he won't forget, uh
I wanna pay more attention to ya (How much do I owe ya)
I die for ya and show you that I'm sweet as me know ya
I wanna get to know ya in and out, so you can go in and out
Right outta my house around nine on the cline

[Chorus]
I be takin' notes on you like you be a test (test)
Got me smiling so bright like I be brushing with crest (crest)
Roll the ' purple blunt up, so I won't stress (stress)
You're the best, definitely different from all the rest
If you ask me to marry baby I'll say yes
I want no less, I'm so blessed to give you a nest
I'll be talkin' bout our love, till in peace we rest
And after that...how much you wanna bet

[Verse 2]
You got me jumpin' like bungee, I'm askin' how high
Sweet as mum's potato pie, now that's a fly guy
He be havin' me trippin', like I be a bitch bitch
But he know that in my intentions, sometimes i get caught off thinkin'
Just a lil' too much, sometimes I get jealous
Sometimes I question your trust, but you be hangin' with me
Cause I be solid as a rock, keep steppin' it up a notch
Watch over your flock and put bullets in all your Glocks

[Chorus]
I be takin' notes on you like you be a test (test)
Got me smiling so bright like I be brushing with crest (crest)
Roll the purple blunt up, so I won't stress (stress)
You're the best, definitely different from all the rest
If you ask me to marry you baby I'll say yes
I want no less, I'm so blessed to give you a nest
I'll be talkin' bout our love, till in peace we rest
And after that...how much you wanna bet

[Verse 3]
He said, "I'm keepin' thin, like paper yeah she's a keeper
A lil' deeper than all them other people that they used to sleep up
She keep it going like the bonnie with the drum
Going ruppa-pum-pum, while im chillin' sippin' on that rum"
He said, "She made me a better man, cause I was a rich hoe
Married to a hoe, that married me for my dough"
Keepin' my king coming, like a kingdom, like I got a reason to love him and hug him
And get em dirty even, like Christina

[Chorus]
I be takin' notes on you like you be a test (test)
Got me smiling so bright like I be brushing with crest
Roll the purple blunt up, so I won't stress (stress)
You're the best, definitely different from all the rest
If you ask me to marry you baby I'll say yes
I want no less, I'm so blessed to give you a nest (My king)
I'll be talkin' bout our love, till in peace we rest
And after that...how much you wanna bet
