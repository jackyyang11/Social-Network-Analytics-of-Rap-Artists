[Intro: Big Lenbo]
Yeah

[Verse 1: Big Lenbo]
Liquor and a arm chair how my night's ending
Watch a new flick that a friend was recommended
Chilling feet up, smoked out getting drunk
Like I ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever give a fuck
Sho'nuff iPhone come alive
See it on the table from the corner of my eye
Just rolled another J, bout to hit play
Fuck it money calling, what more else to say
Had to make a play, hustle to the grave
[?] spitting game, London on the train
Underground to the rooftop checking the scene
[?] only aces on my team
[?] animated right before your eyes
Made it through the rubble now we [?] out the times
(Check the rhyme)
Peace to this crew, peace to that crew
Ratt Pack coming through
Watching Mac

[Hook]
Brand new
([?] is brand new)
Brand new

[Verse 2: Big Lenbo]
Hair slicked back like I'm from [?]
Fat frame [?] to the dome
You this shit knocking like a nigga ain't home
[?] hide the cellphone
Watch me get up the zone
Sativa scented funking up any room I've entered
They say the strange days demented
That's because I'm hellbented
Manifested heaven sented
No front, what you expected
Supreme lecture
Fluent style with the rugged texture
[?]
Out [?] voodoo [?]
Power strutting through the sector
Chiefing [?]
Oh shit almost slipped
Lenny kept the same grip
Polished up the game but I'm always on that same shit
[?] the county
[?] is the place that raised the [?]
Now watch it mac

[Verse 3: Michael Christmas]
Liquor in a headlock, arm bar, choke
Gun smoke turn to blunt smoke, stay out of trouble
Out the mud now my feet black, I'm Barney Rubble
My baby said put the seat back, she did the huddle
My dick disappeared like abra-kadabra
Dick disappeared like Casper
These raps are called natural disaster
I don't wanna eat the ramen, I have to
If it's money then I'm on your ass like [?]
I woke up looking just like Queen B, it's miraculous
The weed's sticky and the pack the same size as a tablet
I'm doing all kind of critical hostile damage
Might rob a bank, all my rap dough is mismanaged
Bought the kicks, got J's like I'm in high school and Spanish
If they had a no pussy getting club I'd of ran it
Now they wanna be my friends but I don't understand it
Like the words that was coming out your mouth
Out your momma house with the plate
Mad respect for watch your mouth
Make niggas uncomfortable like the south
And fuck this crew, and fuck that crew
Buy us, fuck you
Them niggas always acting brand new
