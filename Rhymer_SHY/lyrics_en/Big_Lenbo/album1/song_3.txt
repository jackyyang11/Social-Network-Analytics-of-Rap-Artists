[Intro]
There's something out there
It lives, out in those woods
In the dark

[Verse 1]
Yo what's creepin' in the shadows
Where the back road narrows
Off the 212 Powder Mill where the feds harrow
Complex fellow more a beast then he tends to tell em
Goatman lurkin' certain he the real urban legend
Don’t get caught up in his section cloak hides the imperfection
Smokin' weed constantly tend to taper his aggression
Used to get his trees from swamp thing had the dope connection PG caught up with him now he's headed for correction
Boogie man thats the brethren push the chevy bubble wolfman Rollin' through full moon shot him in the muzzle
Goatman on the hustle catchin' bodies on the humble
Sasquatch he in trouble cause he comin' for his spot on the double
Stuck the Pigman for the truffle
Loch Ness left him lifeless in a puddle
Chupacabra he a bitch ain't on the level
Left the Mothman in the ditch with the jersey devil

[Hook]
Goatman, Goatman
Goatman, Goatman
Goatman, Goatman

Goatman, Goatman
Goatman, Goatman
Goatman, Goatman

[Verse 2]
Nobody really know him its about time to show em
Been livin' on the fringe, so where do we begin?
Some say harmless others know he heartless
Can't dismiss the charges
Let's be honest, everybody see you livin' in the darkness
More laid back in his older age
Opposed to the older days, teenage full of rage
Busting out the FDA, Cage, cop the gauge seeking blessings
From the sage
Pray never have to spray
If it may, hope it's to his enemy's dismay
Times have changed since a juvenile delinquent had to switch it thinking different
Couldn't see the bigger picture so he focus on specifics
How to get it putting shit together hammering the rivets
Hard as granite
Cut too rough to understand it
Never syncing to your orbit, life on ‘nother planet
Troublesome like an art from the start the troubled son
Widen up his arch endless vision built a frame of mind around a single thought

[Hook]
Goatman, Goatman
Goatman, Goatman
Goatman, Goatman

Goatman, Goatman
Goatman, Goatman
Goatman, Goatman

[Outro]
You're so sick mentally
