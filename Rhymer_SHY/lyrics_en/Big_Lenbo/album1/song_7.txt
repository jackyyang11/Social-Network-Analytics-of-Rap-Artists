[Verse 1: Big Lenbo]
The keeper of the skill, bring thrills by the mills
Keep it to your ma, penetrate like a drill
Coming in raw like my bitch on the pill
Ralph Lauren, while yall niggas peddle swill
Fuck your hundred cars and your big rap deals
When you do it for the culture you must have skill
Your image a facade, you fake to keep it real
Your life a mirage, tough to swallow that pill
That red fire power, Buffalo 10 mil
When the [pen] take aim, the competition get kill
Hot like coal, but I'm not from the ville
From that 301  yell Son of Delphi O'Mille
Now I'm in the west coast chillin' in the hills
Making moves with the team, bitch I ain't tryin to chill
Gimme the contracts and all that, nigga lets go
From nothing to the summit, now we all top build
We ain't gonna stop till we live like Uncle Phil
And then still rep the culture forever
A hip-hop head since 8 ball leather
My roof rugged, thick skin all weather
Bust up any crew that claim to do it better
That's BIG LENBO, all caps bold letters
Droppin' jewels every measure people dig like treasure
Come through, head severed
Get cheddar, all together
Protect your neck, who's next?

[Hook]
When I approach rappers be take notes
Man that ass can't hear what your eyes can't see

[Verse 2: Big Lenbo]
Hill top on the spices
Trynna reach Nirvana like the pisces
My lifestyle, my shit priceless
Tryna get a head, my shit ISIS
No one ever cross
Just left the crowd feelin righteous
Who? [?]
Gettin' dollars on his Jonny Quest
Come check if you really wanna flex
In pursuit of the loot
Never impressed by a groupie or a critic
Couldn't care less
What the fuck you think these walls for? Lil' Bitch
You exactly what my balls for, off the dick
Make 'em sick, and flick, my ruggedness
Hit the licks, passin' J's to my nigga 6ix
Hats like a ticking time bomb stretch out my catalog
Drunk on the bus in Prague
Driving through the fog
Hit you with another one
Blessed up like Khaled, bright like Edison
Tight like veterans on the field set to kill
In the world, men are tested by their will
Destroy and build, both sides of the force
Can't run with the pack, stay your ass on the porch

[Hook]
When I approach people take notes
Man that ass can't hear what your eyes can't see
