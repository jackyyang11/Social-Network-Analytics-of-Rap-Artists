[Intro]
You're travelling to another dimension
A dimension not only in sight and sound
But in mind
A journey into a wondrous land
Whose boundaries are that of imagination

[Verse]
Workin' through a process
Focus on the content
Defined by the rawness
Designed for the offense
Callus where the heart's kept
Mallace where the thoughts went
Warfare the meanest
40-cal the cleanest
Doesn't take a genius
To figure that he mean it
Not for the squeamish
Flow so seamless
Industry where his peers dunces he the dean's list
Satchel page of the game, living out my dream shit
Fuck the fame
Keep the gains cumming like a freak bitch
Nothing changed
Still the same nigga that  PG shit
All these lames sound the same
Corny spitting cheese grits
I be throwing game
Till she need L like a seamstress

[Interlude]
You unlock this door with the key of imagination
Beyond it is another dimension
A dimension of sound
A dimension of mind

[Verse]
Lenbo, the slick talkin' ratchet fat rapper
Rippin' up the net bully bitin' dog catcher'
300 blackout AAC Honey Badger
40's we contenders it's the end final chapter
Done with all the mumbles go and straighten up your banter
Freddy Kruger face-chette choppin' up [?]
[?][?] In veins Im'a hit ya while ya lather
Gunnin' for ya throat make it hot like a tender
Young Jesus dropped heads rung like a ladder
Need a dose of dope Ol' Boy got the answer
[?][?] the goat any other talkin' slander
No matter fuckin' what you never complicate my candor
Fuck the world and fuck you all [?] [?]
Came to rock the boat, sinked ships with the grammar
Sniper with the scope, crosshairs on ya Bamas
(Sniper with the scope yeah)
Eagle eye on the prize
Hawk in the riches
Systematically battling, caught in the trenches
Never rattling, batter swing gone for the fences
Dreams shattering, that'll bring god thru dimensions

[Outro]
There is a fifth dimension
Beyond that which is known to man
It is a dimension as vast as space and as timeless as infinity
It is the middle ground between light and shadow
Between science and superstition
And it lies between the pit of man's fears
And the summit of his knowledge
This is the dimension of imagination
