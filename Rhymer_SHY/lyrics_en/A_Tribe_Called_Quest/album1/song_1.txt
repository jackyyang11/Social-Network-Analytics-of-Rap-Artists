[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
...-Like that, It's like this
When you hear the nigga yo he be in a bliss
'Cause I make the rhymes and it's just a easy gist
With a twist, of my nouns and my verbs
Consummated, into a sentence, ease of words
That I'm at (hmm), so amazin', when I'm blazin'
Just like a trip to Portland, Trail Blazer
But yo listen, yo I gotta say it like this
I got the Phife Dawg and he wants to assist
To persist (yeah) with the rhythm (yeah)
Give 'em (yeah) what you got (yeah)
Phife Dawg hop (check it out) off the mic (check it out) and make the joint hot

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Malik Izaak Taylor is the illest rhyme creator
Let me be the first to say; that I be's a player hater
'Cause I hate when emcees play on this device known as a mic
Then have the nerve to even think that their rhymes and they're tight
So I laugh, quietly watching how the industry's bust
All these video sluts, and guys who front like they're tough
All these million-selling rappers with the bogus-like husks
Withew[? 0:48] brothers screaming "Brooklyn!", when they're probably from Lynbrook
And oh, I see hood raps putting 40's to their lips and head
Go out buy a chalice, and they wanna be a dread, oh my head
Someone pass the buffering, I'm sufferin'
Too many heads out here, word is born, they just frontin'!
I'm stayin' true, making sure my game's legit, no time for ass and getting caught up in that glitzy
Without my peeps I don't know how the hell I'd make it
But just by having them around lets me know I won't fake it
So big up big up!
Because you emcees ain't ready
Peace to Allen Iverson, my man Stephon Marbury up in, the NBA
And I'm gonna be writin' for the magazine soon
Check me out, boom!
I'm out!
