[Interlude: Interviewer & Witness]
You told me that you were sitting in class this morning and you saw a lot of police. Tell me -- tell me how you found out what was going on
Well, we found like there was all these people. And we found out because there was -- we were like right near the window in our classroom. And like we saw like police officers and we heard them on the roof and in our building
Was everybody crying, scared, wanting their parents to come get them?
Yeah, they were. And then some people were even like -- they kind of felt *inaudible* they got a stomachache
Did you hear any gunshots or anything like that?
Well, police officers, like they were -- they were kind of, because there were police officers, like right out the door, like trying to find the guy
Are you okay right now?
