[Intro: A$AP Ant]
Cream Faygo man I feel like Hood Rich Pablo Man
You already know man like lets get it man
Ya dig what I’m sayin man that’s some shit man
Big diamonds on deck man ya dig what I’m sayin

[Chorus: A$AP Ant]
Pockets so loud that they filled with the guap
Pockets so loud that they filled with the guap
Pockets so loud that they filled with the guap
Man the bank teller know me on my first name
Ya dig what I’m sayin ya feel me, first name ya dig
Pockets so loud that they filled with the guap

[Verse 1: ASAP Ant]
Pockets so loud that they filled with the guap
Pockets so loud that they filled with the guap
Ink on the counter so young nigga plot
Running from cops I hide dope in my sock
That Draco be shooing man I cannot box
Look at my bitch she look like a fox
Stackin my money invest in the stocks
Diamonds I cool off I’m feeling so hot
2018 not rocking no Jordan’s
I cannot stop till my car is a foreign
Gelato from Cali it taste like a orange
Go to Miami I hop on a boat
A nigga so fly but I never sold dope
Don’t hang with them niggas cause they do the most
I be like Kanan these niggas be Ghost
White model bitch and she play with her nose
Got a new Iphone I stored it with hoes
Damn I love when be dancing on that pole
Foreign my outfit, I spoiled her with clothes
Feel like I’m AI I give and I go
Yea I had this lesson but no I can’t love her
These niggas bluffing they know they can't fuck her
Diamonds my sister diamond my mother
Marino my clothes Marino my covers
Loud pack it stink and it smell like some mustard
My diamonds like Rita's they ice as the custard
Mixing the lean and it taste like some gushers
You smoking a backwood but I been to Russia
White model bitch and I met her in Russia
Diamonds so cold like I got em from Russia
Diamonds be dancing I got em from Usher
Dreads in my head man I feel like Busta Rhymes
