[Verse 1]
Chickens in the sink
Crack on the stove
Triple beam for the weight
Cut the middle man tryna get 8 white bitches
Snorting off the plate coke from Colombia
Riding round in the Benz looking like a trap star
Flipping raw day and night
Tryna get my money right naw I ain't living rite
Fucking bitches all night kick 'em out the next day
Everyday is pay day
Hit me with a half bring it back in two days
Living in Cali by the ocean
Condo got em open
Long dick stroke em
I send 'em to the husband he over there fussing
I'm over here fucking no loving
Puffing on heavenly rock star 70's
Slim pants ripped jeans Jeremy Scott wings
Fucking heavily counting up cream
Rolling on beans disobedient with trees
Tatted from neck to ear bitches they want to stare
Macking with hoes as I pose
Hand in my draws henny out my pores
As I pour hit the blunt too much you on the dash as I pass

(Hook)

Coke and White Bitches
Coke and White Bitches
Just Coke and White Bitches
Coke and White Bitches
Coke and White Bitches
Just Coke and White Bitches
Coke and White Bitches
Coke and White Bitches

[Verse 2]
Different money different days
On my hip I got that cake
Close your mouth if it ain't about 'cane
Over the stove mixing
Hitting swishers
Red paint tripping, blue seat sack tripping
Coke I hold tripping
I'm pimping hat tilting
No limping fuck sipping
I'm shitting on you niggas
Seven figures go figure
Surrounded by white bitches
Slipping off wedding rings
She do her one two thing
Cali with the pool in the back
Got these niggas backs
Meet me by the border ounce to a key
Flying over seas
Korean imported extorted these niggas
Smoking out the bong
Lighting up the spliff Basel on my wrist
Bought me a six pop the willy on that bitch
She snorting off my dick put her on the strip
Flipping my bread triple my spread nigga bring it back
Triple my racks bricks in my backpack
What up to Troy Ave
Still pouring up deuce in the triple cup
Purple lean or that yellow tuss

(Hook)
