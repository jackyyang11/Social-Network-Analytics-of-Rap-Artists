[Intro: A$AP Ant]
Cream Faygo man, I feel like Hood Rich Pablo, man
You already know, man, like let's get it, man
Ya dig what I’m sayin', man, that’s some shit, man
Big diamonds on deck, man, ya dig what I’m sayin'

[Chorus: A$AP Ant]
Pockets so loud that they filled with the guap
Pockets so loud that they filled with the guap
Pockets so loud that they filled with the guap
Man the bank teller know me on my first name
Ya dig what I’m sayin' ya feel me, first name ya dig
Ugh, Ugh, Ugh, Ugh, Ugh
Pockets so loud that they filled with the guap
Ya, ya, yeet

[Verse 1: ASAP Ant]
Pockets so loud that they filled with the guap (yeet)
Pockets so loud that they filled with the guap (ugh)
Ink on the counter so young nigga plot (ugh)
Running from cops, I hide dope in my sock (yo)
That Draco be shooing, man, I cannot box
Look at my bitch, she look like a fox (ooh)
Stackin' my money, invest in the stocks (ooh)
Diamonds I cool off, I’m feeling so hot (ooh)
2018 not rocking no Jordan’s
I cannot stop till my car is a foreign (yeet)
Gelato from Cali, it taste like a orange
Go to Miami, I hop on a boat (yo)
A nigga so fly but I never sold dope (ugh)
Don’t hang with them niggas cause they do the most (ugh)
I be like Kanan, these niggas be Ghost (ya)
White model bitch and she play with her nose (yeet)
Got a new iPhone, I stored it with hoes (yeet)
Damn I love when she be dancing on that pole (let's get it)
Foreign my outfit, I spoiled her with clothes (let's get it)
Feel like I’m AI, I give and I go (ya)
Yea I had this lesson but no I can’t love her
These niggas bluffing, they know they can't fuck her
Diamonds my sister, diamond my mother (ya)
Marino my clothes, Marino my covers
Loud pack it stink and it smell like some mustard (ugh, ya)
My diamonds like Rita's and they ice as the custard (ya)
Mixing the lean and it taste like some gushers (woop)
You smoking a backwood but I been to Russia
White model bitch and I met her in Russia
Diamonds so cold like I got em from Russia
Diamonds be dancing like I got em from Usher
Dreads in my head man, I feel like Busta Rhymes

[Verse 2: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Ya
Pablo Juan, fuck on a thotty
I drop a deuce in my soda pop (wait)
Why you actin' like a gangsta, you know you not
Whip it make you turn to crack, break it down above the rock
Hood wolf got a white girl, call her Goldilocks
She a freak, she gon give me good kush
OG, long chopper and it rush
My diamond wink at you, it got her blushin'
Smoked a cutie and still got a dozen
I know I'm dead wrong, fucking her cousin
WCW, she got me crushin'
Your diamonds, they look a lil dusty
Inside my foreign whip, custy
Run up on me and I'm bustin'
You gotta second, they rushin'
Lamborghini, colored mustard
I was in the street, you know that you wasn't
Dope boy fresh, momma raised a hustler
No, we don't love her or trust her
No, we don't hang with no busters
Shooting star, caught a buzz, like a bust
I ain't no gangster or killer, I'm other
In the game, shooting dice, I make it double
Trap money, cumin' just like some rubber
My shoe new, my jean new
My shirt new, my belt new
It's easy to pull up on boo new
Smokin' gelato, that Fruit Loop (Gelato)
