[Hook: A$AP Ant]
Uh, look at my bitch, she lit
Look at the sauce, it drip
Prada, look at the kicks
Suckin' my dick, no kiss
Got an outfit, can't afford it
So many swags in my closet
[?] my pocket [?] they keep fallin'
Bentley my truck got me parallel parking

[Verse 1: A$AP Ant]
Gun like a blunt we gon' pull up and spark 'em
Got a white bitch and she came from Wisconsin
Fucked her then eat her then fucked in the morning
Stackin' my Acne, my pants they keep fallin'
Go to Jamaica to swim with the dolphins
Out of this world, man I feel like a martian
Own the whole building I don't need apartments
[?]

[Verse 2: LuLu P]
4 white bitches with me at the garden
And another young nigga going harder
On a nigga top like a barber
Filled with the infantry, they wanna get with me
Baby is you [?]
These bitches they know how I came in
These niggas dickriding [?]
I know you niggas tender
I put your bitch in a blender (aye)
You got that bitch off of Tinder
I know you niggas beginners
[?]
Bitch, I just do it like the night check
In the booth 1, 2, mic check
I do this shit for the right check
I know the thrill [?] like that
I'm from MD bitch I'm like that
Bitch [?] mic check
Your baby daddy he tight cap
She sent the message through snap cat
They send the pussy through Snapchat
These niggas skinny they rap snap
Pull around you get blasted

[Hook: A$AP Ant]
Look at my bitch, she lit
Look at the sauce, it drip
Prada, look at the kicks
Suckin' my dick, no kiss
Got an outfit, can't afford it
So many swags in my closet
[?] my pocket [?] they keep fallin'
Bentley my truck got me parallel parking
