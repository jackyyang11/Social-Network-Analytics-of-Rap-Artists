[Hook]
Oh yeah
I done made my name
Look how far I came
Oh yeah
I had to maintain
Look how far I came
Baby this shit was driving me insane
Oh yeah
Had to make a change
A lot of people started acting strange
Shit'll never be the same, but look how far I came

[Verse 1]
Oh man, remember back then? Damn I came from a long way
People always dream about this shit, nigga I was really dreaming 'bout it all day
Like, how the fuck I'ma get money?
How the fuck I'ma get rich?
How I'ma get out these streets?
No baseball, I ain't never thrown a pitch, but
Baby I'm up in the field
My niggas running with me just like some wheels
Just like an automobile, the streets getting hot like a George Foremen Grill
But I'm ready for it, taking in the pain like I just absorbed it
Niggas turned to snakes like the metamorphic, but I'd never give up
I'll never forfeit
No, no, no, no
I came way to far to give up right now
I'm hyping the crowd, people be telling wow
Remember when I was back in the day stealing
Remember when I was drug dealing?
Remember my life was mess now people tell me that their impressed just cause they see me chasing after success
Now people tell me "salute," now people say I'm the truth
Now all these bitches be loving the crew, they want to blow us like soup

[Hook]
Oh yeah
I done made my name
Look how far I came
Oh yeah
I had to maintain
Look how far I came
Baby this shit was driving me insane
Oh yeah
Had to make a change
A lot of people started acting strange
Shit'll never be the same, but look how far I came

[Verse 2]
I'll tell you how it started off, I came a long way
From the back of Crenshaw, I was posted in the Valley
We was up in [?] Park, it was me and Fresco
We was getting them packs off, breaking down the tree
Like we had a chainsaw, I was with my brother
He was getting the glass off
Run up in your crib, mask on, mask off
Never will I quiet, but I'm ducking from the law
I been through so much, she don't know the half of it
I did nothing, but growing up when I ain't have nothing
Now we chilling VIP
Now they want to be like me
Now they want to speed like
Won't drink like me, smoke tree like me
None of this shit came easy, please baby girl you gotta believe me
All of my people they need me, can't wait for mama to see me on TV
We came up the wrong way, but we came a long way
Now people be knowing my name
Look how far I came

[Hook]
Oh yeah
I done made my name
Look how far I came
Oh yeah
I had to maintain
Look how far I came
Baby this shit was driving me insane
Oh yeah
Had to make a change
A lot of people started acting strange
Shit'll never be the same, but look how far I came
