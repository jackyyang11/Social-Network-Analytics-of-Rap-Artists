[Hook: Correy C.]
Call my poker face, I'm 'bout my chips
Got two bad bitches off the rift
Gotta keep my thang on my hip
Tell them thirsty bitches get a grip
I'm on the edge like a cliff
I'm on the edge like a cliff
I'm on the edge like a cliff
Like a, like a cliff

[Verse 1: Gusto Leimert]
What you do on 48th street at the weed shop?
You ain't from over here, you saying that's your weed spot
Slide up on the side, you know how we rock
What's your name? What you doing on this side?
Living life on the edge, you can tell huh?
You like how a real nigga make you feel huh?
She bad as fuck, it was nothing you can tell her
What, she done ran into to them niggas
And I seen you searching
Girl, you seen me lurking
And you seen me purging, but I don't want to hurt you
I'll come late after curfew, then I just might curve yo
I didn't mean to serve you, I didn't mean to work you

[Hook: Correy C.]
Call my poker face, I'm 'bout my chips
Got two bad bitches off the rift
Gotta keep my thang on my hip
Tell them thirsty bitches get a grip
I'm on the edge like a cliff
I'm on the edge like a cliff
I'm on the edge like a cliff
Like a, like a cliff

[Verse 2: Correy C.]
If you aiming at me don't miss
I'ma come back and I'ma hit, so tell your boyfriend not to trip
Unless the nigga carrying some luggage
Every time I come around him, he be asking what's my budget
Man, your nigga want a verse from me
At least your stupid nigga know I don't work for free
Got his bitch doing a reverse for me
Baby, twerk for me
Baby, work for me
She fucking me like it's our anniversary
Give me good brain like university
I don't want one bitch, I want 'em all
I'm living on the edge I might fall
But I can't trip, cause I ain't trying to fall off the cliff


[Hook: Correy C.]
Call my poker face, I'm 'bout my chips
Got two bad bitches off the rift
Gotta keep my thang on my hip
Tell them thirsty bitches get a grip
I'm on the edge like a cliff
I'm on the edge like a cliff
I'm on the edge like a cliff
Like a, like a cliff

[Outro: Correy C.]
Oh yeah, I forgot to tell ya'll
Don't push me cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
