Love to have fun, don't want no boring girl
You let me shoot my shot, I bet I'd score it girl

I was a bad ass, yeah
Hey, hey, now I be fucking with these foreign hoes, yeah
District Boyz baby you know I'm with the Committee
You know how it goes, yeah
Ay, ay, all I want to do is take some trips
Met a bad bitch, she said she's from Egypt
She's from Africa, She's from Africa
Met a bad bitch and she came straight from France
I had to ask that bitch whens he gone into her past
She said that Correy C. I might just give some top in advance
She's just like the rapper, she just wants a chance
Ay, she went with me to go make a movie
Ay, saved the last dance, yay
I told her she's dipping with me
Ay we just like some ranch
I do this shit for real baby girl
I always wanted a bad bitch for the gram

[Verse 2: Cozz]
I just got back from England, trust me I fucked me a bad one
Body on that Eritrean, had a nigga screaming "Oh Lord"
With a Jamaican this evening, she call me Cody Macc the bod man
I don't ever want to, I got to have em' all
Different woman all across the board
It ain't nothing, but a plane ticket
She payed the price, she just came to kick it
Ours remaining the same nigga, different country but the same pimping
I'll put my Mac down, keep my business on the low, and I can't have em' all so I came with my bros
And we ain't fuck em' all, but you know we came close
And it no turning back, if she with us than she chose nigga
My car, that shit is foreign
Look at my life, that shit ain't boring
Look at my broad, that shit foreign, look at her life
Hope it ain't boring, and I say:
