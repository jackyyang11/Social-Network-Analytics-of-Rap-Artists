[Intro]
Hey man these niggas don't know my lifestyle, man that shit crazy
But you know I don't even got to brag, I ain't got to boast
I ain't gotta say nothing
I ain't even condoning this shit
This just my past man this how I live
But for real, for real

[Hook]
I had to serve, I used to be broke all I had was the Earth
I had to serve, waiting for niggas to come get the tree on the curb
I had to serve, the people that know me are not my friends the're customers
I had to serve, bought my first wind and I seen the cops had to swerve
Fuck they after me, they right in the back of me
Niggas we gotta go, damn this is a new [?]
Fuck my L's is just bending, just the other night I got apprehended
Nigga this shit isn't funny cops be looking for me, I'm only pulling up for money

[Verse 1]
Damn I dropped out of school, I [?] off my job now I'm fat broke, Fuck
My nigga, my dog  told me go cop some kush, I ain't talking to smoke
I had to serve, he told me go get it, nigga stop tripping, nigga just go and flip it
He told me to cop a half, looked at the nigga then I start to laugh
But my dog was right I got me some flight
They caught my revolver with [?] hollow tips, then saved my money and got me a whip
Damn now the police always on it, damn they my number one opponents
When ain't worried run the bonus, with my brothers like the Jonas

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Fresco]
Fresco, Fresco pull up and serve
Stick to my word, I got what you need
Niggas be acting like fiends, I charge them a fee
I chase the green and I smoke green
Pull up, hit me, and its a go
All in the alley I got to get dough
Waiting for me man that shit for the low
Serve you a half and charge you a O
I got to get my mines, fuck all them dimes and shit just not adding up
Trapping hard now its just adding up, a lot of that kush I tell them just back it up
I see you haters just mad as fuck, how dare a nigga come after me
That's a sad song catching causalities

[Hook]
