Lil mama on my line
Aye, she said she know I'm on my grind
Aye, man she told me if I don't mind
Man, she wanna pick a day when she can spend time

It's whenever she want it
Wherever she want it
You know I'll be on it
Girl, you know I'll be on it
It's whenever you want it
Wherever you want it
Girl, you know I'll be on it
Baby, just tell me when you want it

Aye, and we can kick it ASAP
If you tryna throw that ass back, I'ma catch that
Aye, too fat, let me grab that
Too fat, let me have that
Matter fact, we can kick it ASAP
Matter fact, we can kick it ASAP
Where you at, we can kick it ASAP
If you throw that ass back, I'ma catch that

Got me waiting up late for a fucking text back
They know who I be, I don't need no ID
But I'm Correy C
Now these bitches just be swarming me
Used to be ignoring me, now they all adoring me
And I told her then what
