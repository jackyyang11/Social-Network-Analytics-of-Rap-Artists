[Intro]
Mittee Gang
Yeah
Shout out to Meez cause he noticed me nigga!

[Verse 1: Cozz]
It's the journey, from concrete
Mama had told us that we moving North Beach
Now we jump on beats, and sin in the suburbs
Andrews had called me, "Our friends been hurt."
Came off the curb, get what we deserve
Let that past burn, dog you live and you learn
From plotting on Slauson, and now it's so turnt
Back then they ain't care, and now they concerned
(So tell 'em who you is)

[Hook: Correy C.]
I'm Correy C the G, I know you heard that
I was serving on the corner where the curb at
I know people struggling in the streets ain't got the nerve yet
This for my people, I know that they nervous, but I heard that

[Verse 2: Correy C.]
I can hear the people crying, I heard that
Mamas watching sons dying, I hope that God in my prayers
Mom, I can't repay her, hopefully I can save her
From all the problems that she gotta deal with
All the pain, I can really feel it
I can be there for you, I can make a difference
Gotta stay consistent, gotta stay persistent

[Bridge]
I can change the world though
Changing people with my word flow
My nigga this is what I work for
My people heard I had it worse so we deserve more

[Verse 3: Correy C.]
My niggas grew up with no silver spoon
Bedroom was the living room
Don't trip, we'll be living soon (I promise)
Trust me baby I'm the same one
Up in the streets where I came from
That Krenshaw district where my name from (Squadron!)

[Hook: Correy. C]
I'm Correy C the G, I know you heard that
I was serving on the corner where the curb at
I know people struggling in the streets ain't got the nerve yet
This for my people, I know that they nervous, but I heard that

[Verse 4: Correy C.]
I'm hearing all these voices, dealing with all these choices
My partner stressing, got 3 kids, dealing with unemployment
Everybody evil, gotta help my people
If you ain't got it then I got it, nigga I'ma feed you
I'll never leave you stranded (I'll never leave you stranded)
I know some people feel abandoned
I know how it feels to struggle, how it feels to hustle (I do)
I was getting in to scuffles, fighting using knuckles
So I know what you going threw, man I feel you
Baby this what I'm going to do, show you the real truth

[Hook: Correy. C]
I'm Correy C the G, I know you heard that
I was serving on the corner where the curb at
I know people struggling in the streets ain't got the nerve yet
This for my people, I know that they nervous, but I heard that
