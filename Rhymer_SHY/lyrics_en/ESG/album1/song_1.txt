To murder if I have to
To murder if I have to
To murder if I have to

[Verse 1]
Straight dealin bout 11 on the D-O-T
Dolla signs on my mind cause ain't a thang for free
I'm steady ballin', but never fallin', damn them hoes keep callin'
Is that, that nigga that's on the trigga that's steady hollin'
Off a, couple of dead ones, don't wanna see that red rum
That pistol whip a nigga with that fuckin' infrared son, see
I want it all, cause now it's time to ball
I'm tryna blow up like my name was Biggie Smalls
Past the quarter pound, now break it down as I clown
It's goin down, where's my destination fool in H-Town
So hold your weight now, cause ain't no motherfuckin' lackin'
You're just mackin', Cadillacin', zig zaggin'
That straight pimp game from the South
Now what's it's all it about
With the motherfuckin' diamonds in his mouth
See bloodbasket fill ,this nigga that get your cap peeled
For real I grab that steel, cause you know I got them 187 Skillz

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Gimme a bird and imma cook it, a show and imma book it
Now-a-fuckin days seems that nigga that's livin' crooked
Sellin' rocks, makin' knots, cause my G's is too raw
And I got love for my thugs, from South Park to Crenshaw
So Mr. Officer why in the fuck you treat me rude
Cause I smell like endo and I was jammin' Ice Cube
But I be true to the game, ain't nothing changing but clips
I'm runnin' scratch makin' mil and collectin' my chips
I'm sellin' yay every day, I'm down with young Dre
I'm straight from Houston Texas took a trip to East Bay
So it's on, from motherfuckin' dusk to dawn
I got a pocket fulla drugs and mo' thugs than Bone
So it's real, when nigga that comin' around that gettin' that cap peeled
So do you wanna see that ESG grab the steel
And if I grab the steel, the bloodbasket fill
It's ninety fuckin' six, I'm in the midst, click
187 Skillz
