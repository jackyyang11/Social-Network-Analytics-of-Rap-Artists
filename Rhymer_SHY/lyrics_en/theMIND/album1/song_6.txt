[Chorus]
Walking on thin ice trying to get to you
Walking on thin ice trying to tell the truth

[Verse]
Shift your weight, break through
Seen too many faces get lost in the crowd
Fall in it now
Slipping on feelings I never felt before
I just wanna be sure, try
Read me like tattoos
Tell the truth I won't ask you
If you fall in, I'll catch you
I don't smoke but I'll match you
I just need you to compromise and I will do the same for you

[Chorus]
Walking on thin ice trying to get to you
And I'm walking on thin ice trying, trying to tell the truth

[Outro]
Don't know where I'm going, but I'm going nowhere fast
Nowhere fast
Don't know where I'm going, but I'm going nowhere fast
Nowhere fast
