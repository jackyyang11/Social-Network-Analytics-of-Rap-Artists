[verse 1: Via Rosa]

I could tell you why
I could tell you why

I could tell you why the clouds are grey
Why the grass is green
And why the flowers bloom in may
Why the snow it falls
And sometimes the rain
It seems it'll never stop
Stop
Stop
I couldn't tell you
How much i really loved you
I couldn't even try
N now im sitting in this empty room without you
Its just me myself and i
Its just me myself and i

[hook: Via Rosa]
Im out here on my own now
Out here on my own
Im out here on my own now
Out here on my own
Im out here on my own now
Out here on my own
Im out here on my own now
Out here on my own
Its just me myself and
Its just me myself and i

[verse 2: TheMIND ]

Murder was in thee eye of the beholder
I told her
Cold shoulders are given like Palms durning pass over
Her fingers read ready
And You know your soul just don't drift off
You got a couple prayers before your minds flawed
Blind starts
We all claiming that faith led us here but
When We all know that that face let her Steer us
Jesus grab wheel please don't let her kill us
Just me
Lord knows
These feeling are like a nuisance
You tell me to do shit
I tell you what truth is
Told me you wanted change but you could give a fuck about my 2 cent
So you can give a fuck or meet my new bitch
I wish we could just fuck before we lose this
"Mother fucker Just Do it"
Cuz the pussy was so good my nigga
We blow good my nigga
Just to cloud thoughts
Blacken my kind heart
You wanted nigga
Nigga here now
Futures what I fear now
For the next one, all from song that my ex sung
After all I was the reason she was singing
Now this verse gone be left undone
Unsung. Young Ones
