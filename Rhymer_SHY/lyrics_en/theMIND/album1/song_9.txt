Yeah

Her mother named her Jupiter
She had never, ever seen the stars
And we were urban astronauts (And we were urban astronauts)
With a spaceship that couldn’t take us that far

Wasn’t living where I was living
Whoever said the sky was the limit
Wasn’t living where I was living
(Whoever said the sky was the limit
Wasn’t living where I was living
Whoever said the sky was the limit
Wasn’t living where I was living)

Rocket ships race across the sky, they said they'll come
We're all just restless dreamers,  waiting for the launch
If Astronauts landed here, how come we've never seen one
