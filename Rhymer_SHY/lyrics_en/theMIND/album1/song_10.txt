What's the got damn purpose??
For you to
Ever feel perfect
All the best things in life are broken or worthless
That's why nigga get nervous
Good. Things. Don't. Last. Long
That's why I'm working
For the reaper come close them curtains
Got live it up, Everybody dies one day know thats for certain
I'm afraid of my future
Never thought I'd make it this far
Whole living thing dog gone to take getting use to
I see ghost in the rear view
I see ghost in my near view
Can't run can't hide
But the
Tears do
Damn
Good things don't last long {2x}

Hook

I don't care about taking the long way home
As long I got my own
To go to when I'm alone {2x}

I don't care {5x}

"The long way home don't seem so long if you actually go home"
