[Verse]
From this stoop I see the Eiffel Tower
I walk this block just like the Great Wall
This pavement feel like the sand in Cairo
Northern Lights dance above my head
My granny told me read my Bible
As I start to daydream
I see it all in HD

[Hook]
We're bigger than they told us, we're bigger than they told us we were
We're bigger than they told us we were (Uhh, uhh)
We're bigger than they told us we were (Uhh, uhh)
We're bigger than they told us we were (Uhh, uhh)

[Outro]
They can trap your body but they can't keep ya mind locked up
They can trap your body but they can't keep ya mind locked up (No, no they can't)
They can trap your body but they can't keep ya mind locked up
No, no they can't
They can trap your body but they can't keep ya mind locked up
