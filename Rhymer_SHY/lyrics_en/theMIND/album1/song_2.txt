[Intro]
I been trying to figure out how to tell you how I feel right now
Can't find a way
Everything's changed
I feel no more
I, guess you

[Verse 1]
What the streets look like?
Cause I ain't been home in a minute, no
I been getting high when I'm feeling low
I been trying to touch the sky when I'm on the road
I been trying to touch the sky when I'm on the road
Cause I ain't been home in a minute, no
I been getting high when I'm feeling low
What the streets been like?
Tell me what the streets been like?
Tell me what the streets been like?
(What the streets been like?)

[Bridge]
I been looking for home, but I ain't make it back
All this time spent alone, trying to make a map
Most my niggas is lost, cuz this shit a trap
Crime waves, dog days, tell me, how we 'posed to live in that?

[Verse 2]
Its all bad, it's been too long
Nowadays the streets I'd roam
Say I left em all astray
But I had to get away to make a way
Hoping that these tracks bring a dreamer home
I was on Sharpnack singing Lena Horne
Trying to change the world, get a Nia Long
Views from the field, make me feel like I'm Piccolo
She wasn't this bad when I seen her
Yeah

[Outro]
Tell me, tell me, tell me what the streets been like?
Tell me
Tell me what the streets been like?
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
I haven't been there in so long
