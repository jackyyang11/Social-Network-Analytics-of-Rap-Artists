[Verse 1]
Welcome to your life
There's no turning back
Even while you sleep
We will find you acting on your best behavior
Turn your back on Mother Nature
Everybody wants to rule the world

[Verse 2]
It's my own design
It's my own remorse
Help me to decide
Help me make the most of freedom and of pleasure
Nothing ever last forever
Everybody wants to rule the world

[Verse 3]
Even you
There's a room where the lights won't find you
Hold an edge while the walls come tumbling down
When they do I'll be right behind you
I'll be there for you
