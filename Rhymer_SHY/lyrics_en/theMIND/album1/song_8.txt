[Break: Sun & theMIND ]
If you're reading this then the sun has set and you can finally see your shadow
Guess you really don't need me like you think you do
I see you say you never saw before
Then I watched your eyes light up as mine closed shut
Just, promise me you'll rejoice when you find yourself under the moonlight
Instead of spending time wasting thoughts on loss when, you can truly gain it all
And if you ever pained at all, just
Remember I was there
And you were there all along
