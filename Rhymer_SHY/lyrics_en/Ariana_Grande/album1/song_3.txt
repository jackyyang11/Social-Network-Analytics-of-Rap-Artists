[Verse 1]
Yeah!
I heard a couple of bad things when you were with me
I used to think it was gossip I shouldn't believe, my bae
And I was going around thinking you were my baby (Oh, yeah)
Boy, you were taking the sugar from every lady (Oh, yeah)

[Pre Chorus]
Oh, it went on and on and on
Yeah, it went on for way too long
Oh, baby

[Chorus]
It ain't about what you got
It's all about what you do with it
Ain't about what you got
It's all about what you do with it
How does someone so sexy be so damn repulsive, baby?
It ain't about what you got
It's all about what you do with it

[Verse 2]
All of my ladies will hit me up saying (Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
You better open your eyes, girl
Your boy's been playing (You know)
Oh yeah
And even though on the outside, you're looking so tasty (Oooh yeah)
Well baby boy, on the inside you're nothing but shady
Na na na na na na

[Pre Chorus]
Boy, it went on and on and on
Yeah, it went on for way too long
Oh, baby

[Chorus]
It ain't about what you got
It's all about what you do with it
Ain't about what you got
It's all about what you do with it
How does someone so sexy be so damn repulsive, baby?
It ain't about what you got
It's all about what you do with it\

[Hook]
It ain't about what
Na na na na na na na
It all about what
Na na na na na na na
It ain't about what
Na na na na na na na
It all about what
Na na na na na na na

[Bridge]
On and on and on (on and on and on)
Went on for way too long (Ooh baby)
On and on and on (Oh baby hey)
Went on for way too long
Oooooooooh

[Chorus]
It ain't about what you got
It's all about what you do with it
Ain't about what you got
It's all about what you do with it
How does someone so sexy be so damn repulsive, baby?
It ain't about what you got
It's all about what you do with it
Na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na
Yeah
