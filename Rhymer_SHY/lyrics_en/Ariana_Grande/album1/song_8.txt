Maybe one day you'll feel happy
Aside from all these sad things
I know I don't deserve it
But I can't stop dreamin'

Maybe one day you'll feel happy
Aside from all these sad things
I know I don't deserve it
But I can't stop dreamin'

You deserve the best (Yeah, the best)
So on you go without him (without him)
Leave everything behind
We'll take care, we'll take care
Of everything for you
