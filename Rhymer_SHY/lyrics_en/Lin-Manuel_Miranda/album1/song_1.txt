[Verse 1]
Yo
My family's from Puerto Rico
The tropical destination
Where you can spend your Washingtons, the spot where you vacation
A commonwealth with not a lot o'wealth, a not quite nation
70 billion dollar topic of conversation
Hoping to God John Oliver's comical dissertation
Resonates with the Congress that got us in this situation
Along with suicidal tax incentive declarations
"Yeah we'll pay your bonds. First, close the hospital, fuck the patients."

[Hook]
This is an island, a hundred miles across
A hurricane is coming and we're runnin' up a loss

[Verse 2]
We got here through a million misguided loopholes
That giveth and taketh away business n' poop in our soup bowls
They crapped in yours? They crapped in mine
And somewhere down the line
Strom Thurmond's ghost busted a cap in a chance at chapter nine
The great debate over statehood has to wait
That's Rose and Jack on the Titanic askin' "When's our next date?"
The ship is sinking, we have to say and pay the shit that matters
Then we'll figure out our Facebook relationship status
Will they or won't they? It's Friends' Rachel and Ross
We have to help our island just a hundred miles across

[Verse 3]
To recap, 3.5 million
American civilians are on the hook for billions
Vulture funds are circling and lobbying for payout
There's nothing left to tax or cut we're stuck we need a way out
Allow them to restructure there's no structure for what happens
If you let this crisis play out, when May is less than a day out
It's non-partisan
The hard part is in
Convincing Congress Puerto Rico matters so their heart is in
The fight for relief
Not a bailout, just relief
A belief that you can pass legislation to ease our grief
Paul Ryan, I'll come sing Hamilton at your house
I'll dosido with Pelosi, I'll wear my Hamilton blouse
Your citizens are suffering, stop the bleeding, stop the loss
Help Puerto Rico, it's just a hundred miles across
