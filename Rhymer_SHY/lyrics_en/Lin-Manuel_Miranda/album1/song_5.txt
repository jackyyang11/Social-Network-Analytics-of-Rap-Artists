She was found and pronounced… at the scene
She was already lying in bed
The paramedics said
That her heart gave out…
I mean, that’s basically what they said. They said
A combination of the stress and the heat…
Why she never took her medicine, I’ll never understand
I’d like to think she went out in peace
With pieces of bread crumbs in her hand
Abuela Claudia had simple pleasures
She sang the praises of things we ignore
Glass Coke bottles, bread crumbs, a sky full of stars
She cherished these things, she’d say: “Alabanza.”
Alabanza means to raise this
Thing to God’s face
And to sing, quite literally: “Praise to this.”
When she was here, the path was clear
And she was just here, she was just here…
