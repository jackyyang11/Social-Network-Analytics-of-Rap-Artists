[Ephraim Sykes]
Who am I anyway?
Am I my resume?

[Seth Stewart]
That is a picture of a person I don't know

[Jon Rua]
What does he want from me?
What should I try to be?

[Sydney James Harcourt]
So many faces all around and here we go

[Thayne Jasperson]
I need this job, oh God, I need this show

[Carleigh Bettiol]
Kiss today goodbye
The sweetness and the sorrow
Wish me luck, the same to you
But I can't regret
What I did for love, what I did for love

[Ariana Debose]
Look my eyes are dry
The gift was ours to borrow
It's as if we always knew
And I won't forget what I did for love
What I did for love

[Sasha Hutchings]
Gone
Love is never gone
As we travel on
Love's what we'll remember

[Betsy Struxness]
Kiss today goodbye
And point me t'ward tomorrow
We did what we had to do
Won't forget, can't regret
What I did for love

[All]
What I did for love
What I did for love
Love is never gone
As we travel on
Love's what we'll remember

Kiss today goodbye
And point me t'ward tomorrow
Point me t'ward tomorrow
We did what we had to do
Won't forget, can't regret
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
