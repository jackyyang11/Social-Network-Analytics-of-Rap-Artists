[Verse 1: Randolph]
Emile Heskey, the Chuck Norris of Football
He got so many talents to easily drop your jaw
The way he dribbles down the side line and looks likely to the score
Then steps over but falls over and then misses the goal
He be the greatest to ever grace us with his two left feet
That's why we watch him like every week
Defenders get weak at the knees when he breezes past with ease
Please, don't you dare diss the messiah
A true patriot for the country, yeah he's taking us higher

[Chorus: Randolph]
You don't know what you're messing with
This is Heskey kid, he's the best there is
When he fakes his shot and hits with his left
He still, misses: Heskey
You don't know what you're messing with
This is Heskey kid, he's the best there is
When he fakes his shot and hits with his left
He still, misses: Heskey

[Verse 2: Randolph]
You think that you can
Bend it like Beckham, but can you bend it like Heskey?
The way he'll shoot, but curves it around
And end up in row Zee (or row Zed)
And don't even get me started on his head
When he puts it down and gives you the eyes
You know it's Heskey time

[Verse 3: KSIOlajideBT]
Hahaha
Bitch I'm Heskey
You don't wanna mess with me
If you do, you're gonna be my next anal recipe
I'm too quick for the sex offenders' list
I be over that
When I set my eyes on you, there's no escape
You know that

[Chorus: Randolph]
You don't know what you're messing with
This is Heskey kid, he's the best there is
When he fakes his shot and hits with his left
He still, misses: Heskey
You don't know what you're messing with
This is Heskey kid, he's the best there is
When he fakes his shot and hits with his left
He still, misses: Heskey

[Bridge: Randolph]
Heskey
Yeah, it's Heskey
Darn right, it's Heskey
I told you it was Heskey

[Chorus: Randolph]
You don't know what you're messing with
This is Heskey kid, he's the best there is
When he fakes his shot and hits with his left
He still, misses: Heskey
You don't know what you're messing with
This is Heskey kid, he's the best there is
When he fakes his shot and hits with his left
He still, misses: Heskey

[Chorus: Randolph]
You don't know what you're messing with
This is Heskey kid, he's the best there is
When he fakes his shot and hits with his left
He still, misses: Heskey
You don't know what you're messing with
This is Heskey kid, he's the best there is
When he fakes his shot and hits with his left
He still, misses: Heskey
