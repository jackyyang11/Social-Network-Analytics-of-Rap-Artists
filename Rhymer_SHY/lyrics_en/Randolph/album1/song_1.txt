[Chorus: Randolph]
Yeah this is my life
I'm doing what I wanna
I ain't tryna start no drama
I'm just living for the summer
Said I'm living for the, it's my life
I live here for the summer
Yo I live here for the summer
Said I live here for the
And that ain't ever gonna change
She pulling at my heart strings
One, two, a couple more drinks
And it's back to my life
I live here for the summer
Yo I live here for the summer
Said I'm livin' for the summer

[Verse 1: KSI]
Summertime vibe Imma own it
We can get high in the moment
Got the plain white tee
Black lens with my rooftop down yeah I feel OP
Let the rap sings COD
Bare parties when they come see me
UFC when we do our pre's
Then chill on the side when blow them trees
And we living ah
Live in the moment
Just take a chance we can go in and own it
She in denial hasn't moved on in a while
Cos she's done with the line and that running for an isle
But you know we got time, time and space to play
Summertime vibes to the end of the night, to the end of the night, we gonna do it all the nights

[Chorus: Randolph]
Yeah this is my life
I'm doing what I wanna
I ain't tryna start no drama
I'm just living for the summer
Said I'm living for the, it's my life
I live here for the summer
Yo I live here for the summer
Said I live here for the
And I ain't ever gonna change
She pulling at my heart strings
One, two, a couple more drinks
And it's back to my life
I live here for the summer
Yo I live here for the summer
Said I live here for the summer

[Verse 2: Randolph]
Take it all in you can feel it in the air
Jump in the whip we can ride somewhere
Yeah they're gonna look, just let em' stare
This is our world so why should we care
No worries taking our time
Drink in my hand from the morning till night
Jump on a plane we about to take flight
Same thing tomorrow wake up and rewind
That's how I do it in the summer
Watch me win, watch me come up
I feel like a movie star with a stunner
And I ain't even asked for her number
Like yo, said this is my life
We're living wrong or right
I know the future bright

[Chorus: Randolph]
Yeah this is my life
I'm doing what I wanna
I ain't tryna start no drama
I'm just living for the summer
Said I'm living for the, it's my life
I live here for the summer
Yo I live here for the summer
Said I live here for the
And I ain't ever gonna change
She pulling at my heart strings
One, two, a couple more drinks
And it's back to my life
I live here for the summer
Yo I live here for the summer
Said I live here for the summer
