[Chorus]
I want it all, I want it all
I want them 10's, 20's, and all'
I want it all, I want it all
It's never enough, (no) i want more
I want it all, I want it all
I want them 10's, 20's, and all'
I want it all, I want it all
It's never enough, (no) i want more

[Verse 1]
What do you think i rap for? To push a fucking [?]
I want it all, it's a game, it's a sport
And I'm the captain of the team
Got motion picture dreams
It ain't really what it seems, like a tailor with no machine
Turn the lights down let the candle flicker
Put the liquor on nice, I'm in love with her figure
I'm just tryna make a mountain out of a mole hill
This a real fight, this is no drill
I had a taste of success now I'm changed
Take a picture of this moment, take it home, get it framed
It's history in the making, you're looking at royalty
I'm here to make a statement this ain't out of the ordinary
I'm just a kid tryna kick it, so can i finish?
Give my kids the gold card, tell em' no limit
I'm just tryna live my life to the most
Take it in, raise your glass, make a toast

[Chorus]

I want it all, I want it all
I want them 10's, 20's, and all'
I want it all, I want it all
It's never enough, (no) i want more
I want it all, I want it all
I want them 10's, 20's, and all'
I want it all, I want it all
It's never enough, (no) i want more

[Verse 2]

I'm getting off at the top floor, so let me elevate
I'll turn nothing into something let me demonstrate
Got a feeling its my time, I'm never late
I ain't signing on the dot, I got a better rate
Got a better plan, better mind, better life
I know you heard me, I don't wanna say it twice
[?] I'm built better, my natural element's on the mic, a trend setter
You ain't ready, they don't know what its like to be behind
I don't care if the throne is taken, its rightfully mine
You've got to be out of your mind if you don't bet on me
A sure thing for the finish line I'm finally free
I want it all, I'm just collecting what I'm owed
This flow's worth my weight in gold
I want it all, I'm just collecting what I'm owed
The time's now I'm ready to go

[Chorus]

I want it all, I want it all
I want them 10's, 20's, and all'
I want it all, I want it all
It's never enough, (no) i want more
I want it all, I want it all
I want them 10's, 20's, and all'
I want it all, I want it all
It's never enough, (no) i want more (I want more)
