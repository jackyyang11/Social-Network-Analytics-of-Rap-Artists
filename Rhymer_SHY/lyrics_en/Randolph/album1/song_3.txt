[Verse 1]
Visions of greatness I know I'm the one
Running rings round these bitches I do it for fun
Flow colder than ice still hotter than the sun
I'm a little bit of everything mixed up into one
A chemist with the syllables physician with the lyrics
I stay on my toes if I need to I'm a pivot
And G-T-F-O wherever you be at
I got super car dreams no mother fucking fiats
We balling balling yeah you should try it
I see you wanna win but the people not inspired
This a revolution and the people wanna riot
So we gonna raise the roof 'till this bitch is on fire
On fire on fire that's the track of the year
I got 10 more of them so the plaques gonna be near
But no awards, nah, no awards
I'll settle for the cheques I'm and industry whore 'cos

[Chorus]
I'm Homegrown (I don't rep no city)
Homegrown (I ain't got no city)
I'm Homegrown (They won't let me in)
Oh No (They won't let me in)
Homegrown (I don't rep no city)
I'm Homegrown (I ain't got no city)
Homegrown (I'm homegrown)
I Stand Alone (I Stand Alone)
I'm Homegrown
Homegrown
I'm Homegrown
Oh No

[Verse 2]
Ayo it's cool I don't need a cosign
'Cos the money still love me and the diamonds still shine
And the people who real with me still real with me
I'ma make my own lane that only I can drive
Invent my own city put my name on the map
Randolph City Centre how heavy is that?
Nah, matter of fact go ahead scratch that
I'm the king of the world my natural habitat
I'm a bedroom producer still gonna seduce you
And you ain't even heard of the new stuff
New generation, we the YouTubers
Intimidation this ain't what they're used to
I guess I gotta do it myself huh?
Guess I gotta do it myself huh?
Reinvent the hustle and change up
And take of the whole damn nation [what's up]

[Chorus]
I'm Homegrown (I don't rep no city)
Homegrown (I ain't got no city)
I'm Homegrown (They won't let me in)
Oh No (They won't let me in)
Homegrown (I don't rep no city)
I'm Homegrown (I ain't got no city)
Homegrown (I'm homegrown)
I Stand Alone (I Stand Alone)

[Outro]
Homegrown
Homegrown
I'm Homegrown
Oh No
Homegrown
I'm Homegrown
Homegrown
I Stand Alone
