[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
I wanna see you in... look

[Chorus]
I wanna see you in slow motion
Come stay the night we can stay up 'till it's bright
In the morning got the top open
Come take a ride we can go where you like
I wanna see you in slow motion
Come stay the night we can stay up 'till it's bright
In the morning got the top open
Come take a ride we can go where you like

[Verse - Randolph]
She slow but the whip fast
Foot down, give her whiplash
You and I - we a miss-match
Your life goals - already did that
Driving through the... Hollywood hills with a baddy on my right
Left hand drive through the city at night
This a warning to the game better put up a fight
'Cos I be on my way and I ain't being polite
I'm taking over like Rome & Cesar
Got a one-way ticket to the life I been dreaming
Bullet proof to the game got natural anaesthesia
Like your girlfriend's dinner I get better with season
Don't blink or you'll miss it
She sending me lyrics like hieroglyphics
And I don't even need the digits
She got me on IG she know who it is like

[Chorus]
I wanna see you in slow motion
Come stay the night we can stay up 'till it's bright
In the morning got the top open
Come take a ride we can go where you like
I wanna see you in slow motion
Come stay the night we can stay up 'till it's bright
In the morning got the top open
Come take a ride we can go where you like

[Verse - KSI]
Going slow but she come fast
Only race where I come last
'93 boy popping like a B-boy
Breaking down these bitches make 'em freaky like a D-boy
Beast when it comes to the motion
Add the crème de la crème with that lotion
Rub her clit legit like it's an analog
I'm a dog - when I chase pussy I'm a demigod
Everything I'm doing like the bass (Keep it on the low)
Yeah you might be doing it good  (I do it better though)
Keep the clit from under the hood (And watch her body glow)
Fire when I'm using my wood (She know she wanna blow)
Bee's to the honey when they come around me
You wanna be the one but I wanna have three
Introverted and converted
Extroverted I feel I deserve it

[Chorus]
I wanna see you in slow motion
Come stay the night we can stay up 'till it's bright
In the morning got the top open
Come take a ride we can go where you like
I wanna see you in slow motion
Come stay the night we can stay up 'till it's bright
In the morning got the top open
Come take a ride we can go where you like
