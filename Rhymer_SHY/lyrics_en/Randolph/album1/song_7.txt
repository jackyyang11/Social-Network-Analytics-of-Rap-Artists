[Chorus]
I think they need a reminder
Yeah, let me remind them
I think they need a reminder
Yeah, let me remind them

[Verse 1]
Keep it simple no reason to complicate it
I've been writing records and living down in the basement
Aiming for the top so i suggest you vacate it
Or get hit with the cross-fire and evactuate it
They say-they say that i changed, I agree I'm a changed man
It's for the better, got wiser about the game plan
Now I'm the main man, I'm done getting short-changed
Hittin the forth blade, I'm feeling like I'm Bruce Wayne
Flow- like a superhero, Cash- I'm the new De Niro
I get the check and maneuver, It's nothin new
Living proof that you can play the game without them playing you, its nothin new
I'm the king and that's the truth

[Bridge]
I think they need a reminder
So imma take them way back to the start, way before the charts
I think they need a reminder
So imma take them way back to the begging, before the whole team been

[Chorus]
I think they need a reminder
Yeah, let me remind them
I think they need a reminder
Yeah, let me remind them

[Verse 2]
Got my feet up on the desk, Yeah, I'm feeling like a boss now
Full steam ahead, I ain't tryna keep the cost down
Why you gotta remind 'em? Like it's my fault they been sleeping on me
No joint custody, you ain't got me for the weekend only
This for life man, dinner wit' yo' wife man
Get use to it because she been saying that she mine, stan
Damn, they got nothing on my repertoire
Body in the game, put the remains in the reservoir
I know they scared, yeah, I know they can't stomach it
I can see them now in the board room discussing it
No I ain't for sale, this the flow of the future
I'll build the empire myself, to the fans i salute ya (aaah)

[Bridge]
I think they need a reminder
So imma take them way back to the start, way before the charts
I think they need a reminder
So imma take them way back to the begging, before the whole team been

[Chorus]
I think they need a reminder
Yeah, let me remind them
I think they need a reminder
Yeah, let me remind them
