[Chorus]

They can’t stop me now cause I’m on fire
They can’t stop me now, I see them trying

[Verse 1]

Uh, life changing, it’s amazing
Sit right back and let me blaze it
I don’t even smoke but I’ll make an exception
Cos' this right here, nah, this is a blessing

Shouts to yung brook for this right here
Living life without no more fear
Think I might go and shed a tear
Cos this the soundtrack of the year

Yeah, no games, pure life
Uh, no change, but the time ain’t right
When the green light hits, I’ll put my white
Right next to the rose gold, wife at the side

Hope you know what I’m talking ‘bout
Life’s good since I came back out
Black smoke when we smoke your ass
And black tint when we cruise on past

My flow so ridiculous
There’s no way you compete with this
I don’t even know what weakness is
I don’t think you know how peak you is

Uh, life changing its amazing
Looking at the night its got me gazing
Got me believing in myself again
Feel so good like I’m in heaven

Got these angels singing to me
Instrumental ringing for me
People standing by my side now
Think I’m playing boy come found

I’m just thankful for where I’m at
And I ain’t even CLOSE to where I’m supposed to be at

[Chorus]

They can’t stop me now cause I’m on fire (They can't stop me now, I'm on fire, I won't burn out)
They can’t stop me now, I see them trying (They can't stop me now, I'm on fire, I won't burn out)

[Verse 2]

Yo, 2015 a one way year
Got that VYSION up in my ear
Let me spell it loud and clear
V Y S I O N hell yeah

I’m ready, taking it further right now
This just feels like murder right now
It’s one sided, I’m on fire, somebody
Come put me out

They asking me to stop it
I say I need the profit
Cause I’m betting the whole world
Hope that I come out on top of it

I know I brag I a lot
But I ain’t really at the top
Just give me a few more months at least
Then I’m really gon’ start to eat

My life, it keeps on giving
With a mic, I’ll just keep on spitting
On the road from rags to riches
On my way, they taking picture

I’m just tryna change they focus
In this world that’s full of vultures
Tryna stay away form poachers
With our glasses up and toasting

Look I'm humble, just wanna work with the best
With a drink in the sky and a treasure chest
Looking down on the rest, with no rest

Look, see, 10 more songs then the world gonna end
Hope you understand this man
Read between the lines the world’ll never be the same again, amen

[Chorus]

They can’t stop me now cause I’m on fire
They can’t stop me now, like to see them try it
