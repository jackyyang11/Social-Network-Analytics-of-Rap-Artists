Verse 1
Sorry that I've been so off and on
One day I'm feelin you, the next day I don't know
The reason is, that Ive been hurt before
And now Im insecure, I dont wanna feel it no more
But still.....

I really need someone that I can call my own
That loves me just for me, Im tired of being alone
Could you be that someone, That i can call my own
That loves me just for me, Im tired of being alone

To open up to you
But when i look in the mirror im just not the same

Hopefully its you....
