Everyday I wait just to see your face
When I get off the work, them check-ins at lunchtime
What we doin' tonight is on you, it's your night
Cause that's just the set up
Cause later on, Imma beat it up

It's personal, how I feel bout chu
And I don't know why I can't get enough
You bless me with that magic touch
I just rhyme to the beat like (uh)
And Imma do that body like (uh)
Put your legs in the V like (uh)
Oh, a thousand ways girl

It's that noise that you make when you're screaming my name
Saying uh daddy, it's yours
Makes me want it even more
I be yearning for more when I walk through the door
And I see your silhouette
I'm bout to get wet, uh

It's personal, how I feel bout chu, yeah
And I don't know why I can't get enough
