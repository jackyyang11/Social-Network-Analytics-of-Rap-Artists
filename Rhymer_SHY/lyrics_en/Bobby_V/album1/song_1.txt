Yea
I know I live in another state, you know'
We live all the way across the country, you know'
It's just soothing I never seen, you know'
Never absent when you the heart of Oklahoma
Check this out

Baby I know it's hard out here by yourself
But I'mma do what I can, for you I'm tryna be a better man
And I'll out there soon, don't trip
Trust, I wanna make that trip
And lay up in the bed with you yea
And I'll do everything when you wanna do oh baby yea

One thing I know:
Nobody gets me like you do
Baby, that's for sure (that's for sure)
And I may complain when I'm not with you
Call just to hear your voice (call just to hear your voice)
Tryna fill that void (tryna fill that void, tryna fill that void)
I'm annoyed, gotta make that trip
So I can get to your love
I can't go another night without your lips, your kiss, your touch
It's all you

On the first flight
