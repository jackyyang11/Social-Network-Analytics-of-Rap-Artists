(Verse 1:)
For a minute it was looking like
I'd end up one of those guys
Spendin my whole life
Looking for a special lady who'd save me
Maybe I'll never be satisfied
Had a couple? and a couple dimes
(Now I'm looking for you,) why are you so hard to find

(Hook:)
I thought I took one step, I took two back
I'm not even close this time and that's a fact
All I know is that we'd be the perfect match
So where you at love?
I just gotta find you here

(Chorus:)
I gotta know, I gotta know your name (your name)
I gotta know, I gotta know your name (your name)
Why you gotta be anonymous?
I gotta know, I gotta know your name (your name)
I gotta know, I gotta know your name (your name)
Why you gotta be anonymous?
Baby I want you so much
Wanna hold wanna feel your touch
Go fast girl I'm in a rush
Why you gotta be anonymous?
I gotta know, I gotta know your name (your name)
I gotta know, I gotta know your name (your name)
Why you gotta be anonymous?

(Bridge:)
What's your name? (Anonymous)
Where you at? (Anonymous)
Think about you I getta a rush
I wanna meet my miss Anonymous

(Verse 2:)
Then I see you when I close my eyes we all on both times with the delay to sunlight
Everything I tried to tell you I fell to maybe I'll tell you another time
How you keeping me so free I get tied
Gotta strung all on me and aim me, oh nevermind

(Hook)
I thought I took one step, I took two back
I'm not even close this time and that's a fact
All I know is that we'd be the perfect match
So where you at love?
I just gotta find you here

(Chorus:)
I gotta know, I gotta know your name (your name)
I gotta know, I gotta know your name (your name)
Why you gotta be anonymous?
I gotta know, I gotta know your name (your name)
I gotta know, I gotta know your name (your name)
Why you gotta be anonymous?
Baby I want you so much
Wanna hold wanna feel your touch
Go fast girl I'm in a rush
Why you gotta be anonymous?
I gotta know, I gotta know your name (your name)
I gotta know, I gotta know your name (your name)
Why you gotta be anonymous?

(Bridge:)
What's your name? (Anonymous)
Where you at? (Anonymous)
Think about you I getta a rush
I wanna meet my miss Anonymous. (x2)

(Verse 3:)
Is your name Mary Anne
Or Cathy Lee
Wanna hold my hand? come get with me
Which dime wanna ride
Everything on me

Tell me what it's gone be

I gotta know... (I gotta know)
