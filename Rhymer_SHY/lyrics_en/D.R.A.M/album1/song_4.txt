[Verse 1]
Woke up this mornin' like I'm finna make a million
Twenty thousand at the pavilion and they screamin' for me can you feel it
I just left from Gabriels makin' music
On my way to Katiegos we be coolin'
Like leftover plates to go
Then we heat up fellatio, x and o's
One hour euphoria three hours of arguments
The next four I'm unsure bout my place in this world what the fuck in my life I did

[Hook]
This be that shit that make a nigga get off his ass and get money
This be that shit that make a nigga get off his ass and get money
This be that shit that make a nigga get off his ass and get money
This be that shit that make a nigga get off his ass and get money

[Verse 2]
What the fuck was I put here for
What the fuck is my purpose brain lurkin'
My momma mad I ain't working
I feel worthless but when I'm on stage and workin I am perfect
I mess up in perfect stride its alright just as long as you feel the vibe feel the vibe
I don't know how you feel inside
But to me when you run and hide thats music suicide
I done felt crucified not gone lie but I resurrected in time
I’m not Christ but I fear him like mama and grandma
Get drunk like my uncles It's Miller time number nine
I roll up to ease my mind it’s my sedative
Get me through sleepless nights got them headys lit
Headed to riches and notoriety still music my medicine plus the adrenaline

[Hook]
This be that shit that make a nigga get off his ass and get money
This be that shit that make a nigga get off his ass and get money
This be that shit that make a nigga get off his ass and get money
This be that shit that make a nigga get off his ass and get money

[Verse 3]
Been came through paid dues
Just imagine ten steps in my shoes
Riding round Hampton and The News
Broke nigga lookn hard for a clue
I ain't got dope I got dope tho dope flow
Sitn on this talent is a no no leaned back
Sipping on active feeln slow mo speed lag
Give me more time I can flow more believe that
No no no I don’t care what you think because I believe in me
Ima own my goals write it down on a sheet watch it all come to me nigga
Restless days sleepless nights with my computer head phones and mic
Its gone pay off when the time is right and guess what it feels like the time is right
I feel like dynamite

[Hook]
This be that shit that make a nigga get off his ass and get money
This be that shit that make a nigga get off his ass and get money
This be that shit that make a nigga get off his ass and get money
This be that shit that make a nigga get off his ass and get money
This be that shit that make a nigga get off his ass and get money
This be that shit that make a nigga get off his ass and get money
This be that shit that make a nigga get off his ass and get money
This be that shit that make a nigga get off his ass and get money
