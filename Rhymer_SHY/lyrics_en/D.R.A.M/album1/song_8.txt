Hook- Big bang big bang big bang big bang started something
I research space so you can’t tell me nothin
Yea it’s up to something yea it’s up to something
I learned the universe is expanding and it might erupt or something
I know the universe is really old like 13.7 bill
It's mixed  with cataclysm yea it generates still
That means that its building galaxies all through outta space
And you know the earth expanding it ain't gonna erase
Inflation expands the universe with energy
Creating our galaxy so I can be me

Verse 1 :
The reason I’m alive, is not easy to describe
From the theory to the hydrogen and helium collide
Big bang made the stars, the solar system and earth
Big bang is the fastest growing baby since birth

Verse 2:
All that radiation left over in space
Energy left all over the place
I said the earth's history is cray
Big bang big bang big bang
