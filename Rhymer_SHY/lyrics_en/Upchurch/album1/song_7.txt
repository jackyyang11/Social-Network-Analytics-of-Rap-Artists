[Verse 1]
It ain't the money
It ain't the fame
It's a couple hundred folks like me out there
Screaming my last name
It ain't the record sales
It's my voice in the whippoorwills
200 years and a long dirt road
Where they used to be a moonshine still

[Chorus]
American made
Professional grade
Yeah I'm built Ford tough
Ain't much that I can't take
I got scars on my skin like my Chevy has dents
Gettin' covered in mud every damn weekend
I'm 10 foot tall
And American made

[Verse 2]
Red bone on the porch
Shotgun holding forward
With the safety turned off
And a locked screen door
You don't wanna come
Snooping around my place
In the middle of nowhere surrounded by
Good ole boys in 4 wheel drives
That get down and dirty
But still sing Amazing Grace

[Chorus]
American made
Professional grade
Yeah I'm built Ford tough
Ain't much that I can't take
I got scars on my skin like my Chevy has dents
Gettin' covered in mud every damn weekend
I'm 10 foot tall
And American made
I'm 10 foot tall
And American made

[Verse 3]
Flag pole in the front yard flies the pride
Of the freedom of the place where I reside
And I clean up nice for church
Every Sunday
And we drop it half mast and bow our heads
For the good ones gone 'cause we all bleed red
When it's said and done I'll be in Heaven
Fishing up in the shade

[Chorus]
American made
Professional grade
Yeah I'm built Ford tough
Ain't much that I can't take
I got scars on my skin like my Chevy has dents
Gettin' covered in mud every damn weekend
I'm 10 foot tall
And American made
I'm 10 foot tall
And American made
I'm 10 foot tall
And American made
