[Intro]
(Let the band play)
(Oh yeah) Backwoods

[Verse 1]
From the oak trees, to the hay field, to the bonfire on a Friday (yeah)
I grew up in the backwoods with a few crackers behind me (ah yeah)
Some back stabbed me, some stayed real, some lived past them pearly gates
Some hate me, some love me, some call me the redneck Kevin Gates
And I don't care what these critics say (fuck), I'ma do shit how I want it (ah yeah, ah yeah)
I've been to Music Row and all them bitches wanna own me (to hell with that, to hell with that)
Just sign your life away to make a couple, I'ma pass on that (nah)
And keep on rockin' in this square body, ass tilted back
'Cause you can't tell me shit (hell nah, hell nah) no these boys can't tell me nothin'
'Cause I'm out here from the rut while these other one just bluffin' (what's up, what's up)
Ryan Stone looking ass, Luke Bryan lookalike
I'm hangin' out with crazy honkey's who ride flat black motorbikes (what's up)

[Chorus]
Ba-Backwoods (backwoods), and I stay reppin' till the death of me
Backwoods (backwoods), in these holler's, rivers, creeks and streams
Backwoods (backwoods), got redneck nation tatted on the skin
Backwoods (backwoods), and I got plenty crazy cracker friends

Ba-Backwoods (backwoods), and I stay reppin' till the death of me
Backwoods (backwoods), in these holler's, rivers, creeks and streams
Backwoods (backwoods), got redneck nation tatted on the skin
Backwoods (backwoods), and I got plenty crazy cracker friends

[Verse 2]
I burn one in a bass boat, pop bucks with no tags
Drink beer with them old heads rockin' long hair in them dew rags (what's up)
I'ma stand ground till my legs give, I'ma speak real till I'm 60 (what's up)
Stomp ass in these mud holes till this whole country has concrete (ah yeah)
'Cause one thing I've realized is I see shit through these real eyes
And a lot of folks will disguise but I'm here now so that won't fly
I'll call your bluff on speed dial, leave a verse on your voicemail
Show all of my tattoos if you try and ride my coat tail

[Chorus]
Ba-Backwoods (backwoods), and I stay reppin' till the death of me
Backwoods (backwoods), in these holler's, rivers, creeks and streams
Backwoods (backwoods), got redneck nation tatted on the skin
Backwoods (backwoods), and I got plenty crazy cracker friends

Ba-Backwoods (backwoods), and I stay reppin' till the death of me
Backwoods (backwoods), in these holler's, rivers, creeks and streams
Backwoods (backwoods), got redneck nation tatted on the skin
Backwoods (backwoods), and I got plenty crazy cracker friends

[Verse 3]
Back then chicks didn't get me, now I'm hot, they all want me
Got one chick that I mess with, that ratchet shit I don't want it
No new trucks in my driveway, no pocket full of them hundo's
Trailer park shit, hillbilly mother bitch, white boy sittin' here and I'm still broke
Pour some octane in my tank, I'm a two stroke blowin' blue smoke
Bustin' up heads like egg yolks 'cause folks take me as a pure joke
But I'm aimin' high with this new scope, no contract, don't need those
If I need help I'll come get some but I damn sure ain't no average Joe
And I damn sure don't need no shows, I'll make music straight put it out
Go shoot guns with my homeboys, this is real talk from a real mouth
From a real man in the real south, don't even get it twisted
I ain't no damn pretender and I damn sure won't surrender

[Chorus]
Ba-Backwoods (backwoods), and I stay reppin' till the death of me
Backwoods (backwoods), in these holler's, rivers, creeks and streams
Backwoods (backwoods), got redneck nation tatted on the skin
Backwoods (backwoods), and I got plenty crazy cracker friends

(Oh yeah)

Ba-Backwoods (backwoods), and I stay reppin' till the death of me
Backwoods (backwoods), in these holler's, rivers, creeks and streams
Backwoods (backwoods), got redneck nation tatted on the skin
Backwoods (backwoods), and I got plenty crazy cracker friends

(Oh yeah)
(Backwoods backwoods)
(Backwoods backwoods)
(Backwoods backwoods)
