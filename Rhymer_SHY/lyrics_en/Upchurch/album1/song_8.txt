[Intro]
I bet y'all would never guess a redneck would do this shit huh
Hahaha
Check me out y'all
Go ahead talk your shit
Half y'all bitches don't know what a redneck is boy

[Chorus]
Box of bullets red and gold
Smith and Wesson
I'm getting tattoos every time that I start stressin'
Weed smoke blowin' out my truck
Who gives a fuck
I got four wheel drive you will never catch me bud
I'll be like bitch I'm in the woods
Where you at?
Just keep drivin' 'til you see confederate flag
Back yard with my guns, what's the matter
If my neighbors get to bitchin' I'll get louder

[Verse 1]
Straight pipes on my shit you can hear me
Comin' from an eighth mile away no lie 'bout that
'Cause I'll be rollin' in the street in my six-oh
With a 1911 layin' in my lap
John Wayne of the new age in a new way
Can't nobody out do me
Sick hillbilly buckteeth still no shame
I take my drop serious
Hank Hill with the propane no game (Yeah)
And I'm loving this shit
Five star hotels while I'm fucking my chick
My fans got me all on my Hank Williams shit
'Cause I'm flipping my birds 'cause I know that I'm legit
I say what I want when I want how I wanna
Blame my hard head on my Pops and my Mama
But you can not lie that my style is atomic
I remix that ore life because I am wanted
I'm probably the best but I don't want to flaunt it
But damnit my music took off like a rocket
And I don't have plans anytime soon to stop it
Shit I am the king and I'm running this genre
Yeah

[Bridge]
Young gun with the quick draw
Young gun with the big balls

[Verse 2]
Man I just don't get it
They come up to me actin' like they gotta fucking tell me how country they are
So I'll like 'em for some fucking reason
Motherfucker I don't know you and I ain't your god damn friend neither haha

[Chorus]
Box of bullets red and gold
Smith and Wesson
I'm gettin' tattoos every time that I start stressin'
Weed smoke blowing out my truck
Who gives a fuck
I got four wheel drive you will never catch me bud
I'll be like bitch I'm in the woods
Where you at
Just keep driving 'til you see confederate flag
Back yard with my guns, what's the matter
If my neighbors get to bitchin' I'll get louder

[Verse 3]
Cowl Induction on a square body
Got window tint like a president
My girl look like a super model
Check my Instagram for the evidence
My shows folks want to head bang
So I play the drums with my thick skull
Couple shots of Jack in my blood stream
I'm Ron White with my insults
I'm outspoken don't hold my tongue
Ain't scared to shed me a little blood
Won't ever catch me starting fights
But I fuckin' love when I finish one
I'm Willie Nelson with a bag of grass
And I'm Wyatt Earp with a loaded gun
I'm tatted up I'm 24
Realest redneck you've ever seen son

[Bridge]
Hahaha
I'm the redneck rednecks write about, haha
I don't wanna be your friend
I don't want to hang out with you and your click
I want to stay in my part of the sticks
And just do me son

[Chorus]
Box of bullets red and gold
Smith and Wesson
I'm gettin' tattoos every time that I start stressin'
Weed smoke blowing out my truck
Who gives a fuck
I got four wheel drive you will never catch me bud
I'll be like bitch I'm in the woods
Where you at
Just keep driving 'til you see confederate flag
Back yard with my guns, what's the matter
If my neighbors get to bitchin' I'll get louder

[Outro]
Chicken Willie on the way boy
