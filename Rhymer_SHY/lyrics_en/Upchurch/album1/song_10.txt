[Intro]
(Let the band play)
Bad bad bad bad, bad bad bad
Y'all motherfuckers ready?
You know how I do shit
It's the church, Upchurch
(You know what it is)

[Verse 1]
My mama said I was rebel the day I's born
Midnight in Nashville in the thunderin' hailstorm
And I grew up 'round them muscle cars, music and drugs
Daddy had some felonies but still he toted the gun
Now I'm the same way, fuck the rules, load my pistol where you at
Got crazy papers in my wallet, not afraid to kill your ass
The only thing I fear is my Mama and Jesus
If you messin' with my kin you might get chopped up in pieces
My grandpa passed away but taught me all about handlin' business
So don't make me shove that Wesson in your forehead creases
I'll bust your head gasket open, have your whole block leakin'
Yeah I'm redneck, ratchet, and pop off with no reason

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a bad motherfucker, B-M-F
With a rusty buck-knife, comin' for y'alls necks
'Cause I'm a bad motherfucker, bad motherfucker, bad, bad
Bad motherfucker, bad motherfucker, bad, bad
'Cause I'm a bad motherfucker, B-M-F
With a rusty buck-knife, comin' for y'alls necks
'Cause I'm a bad motherfucker, bad motherfucker, bad, bad
Bad motherfucker, bad motherfucker, bad

[Verse 2]
I'm a bad motherfucker, better hide your chick from all my shows
I show up with 'bout 30 bikers, ripped up jeans and tattoos though
My attitude is cold like death ain't nothin' but a fuckin' bum
Burnin' rubber on I-40, watch me as I smoke this skunk
Stink so bad 'cause I'm the shit, ain't got no friends 'cause I'm the realest
Got a style ain't no one stealin', fuck these rappers we're acquainted
Not my boys, my trust is slim, got contacts in my phone for sho'
Tahoe full of white boys that ain't scared to come kick down your door
With my hillbilly shit 'til my hair turn grey, like metal on that 45
I'm a Tennessee redneck, through my music, shit you know I'm down to ride
Got slick bars like a new jail, crew with me that's nationwide
Only rapper in this game now, like a pimp with mud on a four-wheel drive

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a bad motherfucker, B-M-F
With a rusty buck-knife, comin' for y'alls necks
'Cause I'm a bad motherfucker, bad motherfucker, bad, bad
Bad motherfucker, bad motherfucker, bad, bad
'Cause I'm a bad motherfucker, B-M-F
With a rusty buck-knife, comin' for y'alls necks
'Cause I'm a bad motherfucker, bad motherfucker, bad, bad
Bad motherfucker, bad motherfucker, bad, bad

[Outro]
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad bad
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad bad
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad bad
Bad, bad, bad
Bad motherfucker
