[Verse 1]
Yeah, I got one life to live I got six in the chamber
Travel no safety 'cause I'm facin' danger
Got people who hate me, my words may have angered
But I put a pop on the crazy ass stranger
Who's holdin' the knife claimin' that he can take me
With five of his buddies in Nashville off Broadway
But they do not realize my life is important
Got plenty of people I love I'm supportin'
So you bring that knife and I'll bring that Mel Gibson
As for lethal weapon no need for admission
There's no ass in Nashville that my lips are kissin'
I'm too busy winnin' to worry 'bout dissin'
I'm rollin' up one in a tailgate in Cheatham
Wonderin' one day if I'll be a legend
Got God on my side you see my play is to Heaven
The way that I rap you think I'd killed the devil
I'm reppin' that dirty until I'm in a casket
And when that day comes make sure I look fantastic
And ride me through town in a truck that's Jurassic
Just give me my pistol and load it and strap it
Lets ride in that light to another dimension
My heritage tatted bitch I am from Dixie
You wanna take shots and I'm reloadin' quickly
Your aim is all fucked so your bullets ain't hittin' me
Bitch

[Chorus]
Yeah, I am the cowboy the last of Mohicans (the Mohicans)
Shit, I am the cowboy the last of Mohicans (the Mohicans)
Yeah, I am the cowboy the last of Mohicans (the Mohicans)
Bitch, I am the cowboy the last of Mohicans (the Mohicans)

[Verse 2]
If Paw Paw was here then he'd probably be proud
But skip all my shows 'cause that shit is too loud
But he's lookin' down from way up in the clouds
And I'm takin' his traits to go show all my crowds
Carry my gun places I'm not allowed
People will kill ya to be noticed now
My Instagram followers 500 thou'
And these fuckin' devices are drivin' me wild
I get criticized for the truth in my foul
But credit for shit that just flows out my mouth
Love all my fans, put it down for the south
You couldn't trade me the world for me to go sell out
Ripped up jeans what the fuck you mean
Got Wal-Mart boots fuck a big brand name
Shit I barely have gas in my old Grand Am
Now I'm puffin' on the gram sittin' back like damn
Got plenty of people tellin' me we are related
And their brother's uncle's mama went to school with my daddy
And how much money do I make and what the fuck is my salary
I'm a motherfuckin' leader y'all are sendin' me cavalry
Droppin' bombs on the clock like I'm killin' it hourly
All I got is courage 'cause my competition is cowardly
Used to make all my money paintin' high on the balcony
Now I started chasin' my dreams and my dreams a reality
Shit
And anybody tryin' to hook chains in my path
'Bout to rip their rear end by the butt of your ass
And post a picture of your face on a Craigslist ad
Five bucks O.B.O. for your cliche ass
Where the fuck is my knowledge it wasn't made up in colleges
I'm all military minded so you get no apologies
Real ass lyrics bitch know I got a lot of these
Out of all of the country rappers bitch I am the protege
What
Ha, aw shit bring the beat back
Six white crackers breakin' out a black Cadillac
Fuck that bring the beach back
South Carolina rubbin' on my damn fat ass
Rollin' up on that like my fade is legal
Watchin' the sunset with my eyes red as the devil
Pitchfork shit, what, lookin' make it medieval
I might talk a little slow but don't fuck with my temper
What

[Chorus]
Yeah, I am the cowboy the last of Mohicans (the Mohicans)
Shit, I am the cowboy the last of Mohicans (the Mohicans)
Aw yeah, I am the cowboy the last of Mohicans (the Mohicans)
(You know it)
Bitch, I am the cowboy the last of Mohicans (the Mohicans)
(Church)

[Outro]
I am the cowboy motherfucka
The fuck is you sayin'
The fuck is you sayin'
(Church)
The last of Mohicans
The fuck is you sayin'
The fuck is you sayin'
(Church)
Bitch I am the cowboy
The fuck is you sayin'
The fuck is you sayin'
(Church)
The last of Mohicans
The fuck is you sayin'
The fuck is you sayin'
(Church)
Fuck is you sayin'
Fuck is you sayin'
Fuck is you sayin'
Fuck is you sayin'
Fuck is you sayin'
Fuck is you sayin'
Fuck is you sayin'
