[Chorus]
We some back breakin', bill payin', get it, gotta do it all
Paintbrush strokin' framers, carpenters with table saws
Buckwild crazy, gettin' loose on the weekend
Smile on our face even though we never seem to win

Back breakin', bill payin', get it, gotta do it all
Paintbrush strokin' framers, carpenters with table saws
Buckwild crazy, gettin' loose on the weekend
Smile on our face even though we never seem to win

[Verse 1]
I do it for the people wakin' up to early crack of dawn
Rips in our jeans, put the pot of black coffee on
Look into the mirror wishin' for a better day at least
Can't afford a house so they struggle just to rent a lease
Tattoos on my body, no shirt, still I'm wearin' sleeves
Contractors, landscapers, bills look like a pile of leaves
Negativity just trying to reign up on my reckless skin
Pray to God before we sleep, we always stay committin' sins
I'm asking for forgiveness even though I don't deserve it
Man, this crazy way of life, I don't think that we'll ever learn it
But we try to stand strong, make it 24 hours
All to feed the kids and cloth'em love 'em give 'em all the shower
We got murder in the news, do you got a gun beside your bed?
White is the stripes, blue days, blood is always red
Government is actin' like we love a game of Simon Says
But I ain't buyin' shit, put some taxes on them adjectives

[Chorus]
We some back breakin', bill payin', get it, gotta do it all
Paintbrush strokin' framers, carpenters with table saws
Buckwild crazy, gettin' loose on the weekend
Smile on our face even though we never seem to win

Back breakin', bill payin', get it, gotta do it all
Paintbrush strokin' framers, carpenters with table saws
Buckwild crazy, gettin' loose on the weekend
Smile on our face even though we never seem to win

[Verse 2]
Cigarettes smokin' just to take away a little stress
Additives inside 'em just to kill you quicker dude I bet
People always take me as a idiotic piece of shit
But I'm a old soul, this ain't first time I've made life regrets
Reincarnation, son, nobody knows my glory
'Cause when I was only four I was explainin' war stories
Yeah, this life ain't shit, except of all of what you make it
What is you when you're you, when you strip butt naked
'Cause my roots are in a small town, I won't ever bog down
Always love a sip of Jack and kickin' up that Cheatham ground
And when I'm dead and gone one day I'll be back
'Cause a spirit like mine don't get lost in pitch black
I'm a man of many mystery, I'm surfin' throughout history
Just tryin' to find a purpose on a reason why I co-exist
And if I ever found it it was in 1991
Nashville, Tennessee, born in a hailstorm

[Chorus]
We some back breakin', bill payin', get it, gotta do it all
Paintbrush strokin' framers, carpenters with table saws
Buckwild crazy, gettin' loose on the weekend
Smile on our face even though we never seem to win

Back breakin', bill payin', get it, gotta do it all
Paintbrush strokin' framers, carpenters with table saws
Buckwild crazy, gettin' loose on the weekend
Smile on our face even though we never seem to win
