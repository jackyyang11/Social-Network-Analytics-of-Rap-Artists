[Intro]
(I ain't even gotta say it you should already know)
(I'm American grown)

[Verse 1]
Straight out the field just like a child of the corn
I had a fuckin' attitude on the night I was born
I grew up runnin' these roads until my feet turned black
And I discovered Kid Rock in my mama's Pontiac
When I was 10 years old I thought I was Evel Knievel
Even painted my helmet with some paint that my Paw Paw needed
I put a RC Cola can in the back of my bike tire
Sounded like a motorcycle 'bout to drive through some fire

[Chorus]
Long hair with a mouth full of Beech-nut red
Mickey Thompson still hummin' on 30% tread
American flag in the back startin' to reap away
But the colors of big brother won't ever fade
Because my guns stay loaded, deer meat stays froze
Got four-wheel drive for when the south gets cold
I ain't even gotta say it you should already know
I'm American grown

[Verse 2]
American grown like pop eights and the power box
Yeah American stuff like Ford trucks on assembly lines
I'm American dreamin' until the work starts on Monday
American drinkin' cases of Coors on a Sunday
Yeah I take shit from the left until I gotta swing right hooks
You can tell where I stand just by the way that I write hooks
Yeah I'm the son of the south but I'm a man of the whole land
If you spit on my freedom you can get caught with these old hands

[Chorus]
Long hair with a mouth full of Beech-nut red
Mickey Thompson still hummin' on 30% tread
American flag in the back startin' to reap away
But the colors of big brother won't ever fade
Because my guns stay loaded, deer meat stays froze
Got four-wheel drive for when the south gets cold
I ain't even gotta say it you should already know
I'm American grown

[Outro]
American grown
American grown
American grown
(I ain't even gotta say it you should already know)
Mohawk with a mouth full of truth and pride
You ain't even got to hunt or have a four-wheel drive
This is all our home, 'til we're six feet deep
I'll be American grown 'til I've worn those jeans
(This is all our home, 'til we're six feet deep
I'll be American grown 'til I've worn those jeans)
