[Intro]
(Band, band, band)
(Bandplay)
(All night long)

[Verse 1]
She use to hop in my truck, change all my stations
Tell me to leave them black marks on her hometown pavement
Sing along to the jams that play 'bout a million times on the radio
And tell me baby, sing along, but before I ever go

[Chorus]
I get lost in your eyes, fall to your lips
Pull over on a one-lane for one single kiss
And every time I hear one of those Jake Owen songs
It makes me wanna come pick you up and drive around all night long
All night long, all night

[Verse 2]
We would burn up them back roads and slow down for the five-o
I come and pick you up the destination damn it girl we'd never know
Soakin' up these memories in the midnight air
Now every time I pick you up I can't help but stare

[Chorus]
I get lost in your eyes, fall to your lips
Pull over on a one-lane for one single kiss
And every time I hear one of those Jake Owen songs
It makes me wanna come pick you up and drive around all night long
(Church-Church-Church)
All night long, all night long
(Church)

[Verse 3]
All night long, I don't let the neighbors sleep
I treat every road like a checkered flag's at the end
Little thing, women lookin' hotter than Daytona
Puff-passin' with me on some next county marijuana
Hair in the wind like of them magazine covers
And the way she lookin' at me make me wanna burn some rubber
Keep a picture of her sittin' on the tach of my dash
Because every time I see her I gotta get to her fast

[Chorus]
I get lost in your eyes, fall to your lips
Pull over on a one-lane for one single kiss
And every time I hear one of those Jake Owen songs
It makes me wanna come pick you up and drive around all night long
All night long, all night long
All night long, all night long
(All night long, all night long)
