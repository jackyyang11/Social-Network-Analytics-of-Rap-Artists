[Intro]
Church
I'm about to drop Chicken Willie on y'all son
Bet, redneck shit

[Verse 1]
Came up in the scene, fuck everybody attitude
Struttin' on the red carpet, rocking rugged muddy boots
My attitude is short fuse, that Jack D gets me loose
And I always got some crackers round ain't scared of being on the news
I'm cold, shit they know my style is dangerous
I'm hotter than a radiator leaking like a sum'bitch
Got plenty people try'n make me deals down on Music Row
But I ain't down for all that shit and not about to sell my soul
Ha, I'm Elvis Presley of the hick stage
Catch me taking pictures with some bitches wrapped around my legs
Yeah, and I stay pulling up in ratchet with
Got Ford's that look like monster trucks and Chevrolet's [?]
I'm covered up with tattoos and I hang around them good ole boys
Fuck being bad news, strapped up with them Tonka toys
Backseat got an AR, my glove box got a box of brass
My cell phone given contacts, that would love to come and whoop your ass

[Chorus]
The woods ain't safe for you fake ass bitches
I came from them rags with more ammo than the richest
All my Dixieland shit daddy didn’t wear no britches
Fuck around with my family get left up in them ditches bitch

[Verse 2]
Son, my style is dirty like my working hands
Before I worked construction stacking money in my dirty pants
Don't tell me bout no work cause I'm a fucking workaholic
Backwoods as a power line so I guess that's why I'm buzzin'
(hahahaha ain't nobody gonna understand that metaphor unless they're actually from the fucking backwoods)
I got so many things that I'm literally just blown away
Every time I have a show tornadoes start to come my way
I'm all over the place like my steering wheel got a bunch of play
And bitch I'll run you over like my viral video the other day

[Bridge]
Hahaha
Chicken Willie coming out y'all really soon
Y'all gonna love it
All the haters gonna hate it
Fuck 'em
Go for it

[Chorus]
My woods ain't safe for you fake ass bitches
I came from them rags with more ammo than the richest
All my Dixieland shit daddy didn’t wear no britches
Fuck around with my family get left up in them ditches bitch

My woods ain't safe for you fake ass bitches
I came from them rags with more ammo than the richest
All my Dixieland shit daddy didn’t wear no britches
Fuck around with my family get left up in them ditches bitch
