[Intro: YUNG MUTT]
$uicide

[Verse 1: YUNG MUTT]
It's that marble martyr, fucking daughters
Rocking Starter, going farther
Sauce ain't tarter, bitch, it's barbecue
Bitch, I be that breadcrumb-covered motherfucker
Bitch, I'm fucking southern fried
Lyin' to all you look-alikes just to further you from the truth
Sippin' white wine, then committed $uicide
Now I'm sippin' red wine in the booth
Blowin' on a blunt, puffin' up, me and $lick go poof
Goku on the beat
Steady getting money like a toll booth—nah, I'm just playin'
Bitch, I'm broke, $loth broke too
Ridin' in that drop-top with the whole crew, no proof
White pearls wit' one gold tooth, uh

[Chorus: YUNG MUTT]
Let me get the keys to the Rover truck
Let me get the keys to the Rover truck
Let me get the keys to the Rover truck
Let me get the keys to the Rover truck

[Verse 2: YUNG CHRIST]
Ride 'till the sun up, old trucks with the top up
Yet these bitches still stutter
Yung Christ, and I'm smokin' on butter, just another
White creep with no respect
Everyday I hold my breath, tryna meet death
No check, no balance, and no debt
No money, no cars, but I'm on flex
See you motherfuckers don't get, that I could give a fuck about this rap shit
Born with a dope flow and an accent
808s with the slap got ya' back bent
So here's a big "fuck you" to you motherfuckers
Buncha clones, $uicide not like the others
So if you wanna meet that devil shit I got in me
Keep talking, lil' bitch

[Chorus: YUNG MUTT]
Let me get the keys to the Rover truck
Let me get the keys to the Rover truck
Let me get the keys to the Rover truck
Let me get the keys to the Rover truck

[Outro: YUNG MUTT]
I'm the number one stunna
I'm the number one stunna
I'm the number one stunna
I'm the number one stunna
I'm the number one stunna
I'm the number one stunna
I'm the number one stunna
I'm the number one stunna, yah!
