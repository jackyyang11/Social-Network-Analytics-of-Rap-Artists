[Verse 1: $CRIM]
Yo, light that cigarette, I'm trippin'
Ash it, then I flick it
Liquid got me feeling wicked, sickenin' how I'm thinking
Every weekend, durin' evenings I'm creepin', all black secrets
Got a demon who be speakin', I swear to God, they so misleading
I'm just a skeleton in clothing, junkie that be flowing
I be that boogeyman in yo' closet, that drug money in yo' wallet
All black for a home invasion
Smoking that dope 'till I'm Asian
Up in that alleyway, I'm bent, switchblade on my hip
Sippin' dip that's mixed with Crys
Got me tripping, talking shit

[Segue: $CRIM]
Got me tripping, talking shit, uh
I'm twisted on that dip, yeah
Got me tripping, talking shit, uh
I'm twisted on that dip

[Chorus: $CRIM]
Hunnid blunts to the face, hunnid cups of the bale
Hunnid blunts to the face, hunnid cups of the bale
Hunnid blunts to the face, hunnid cups of the bale
Hunnid blunts to the face, hunnid cups of the bale
Hunnid blunts to the face, hunnid cups of the bale
Hunnid blunts to the face, hunnid cups of the bale

[Verse 2: RUBY DA CHERRY]
It's that grim-reaping motherfucker
Patch me up, I'm leaking, snatch me up your bitch
I'm ridin' dirty, swervin', and I'm skewing
What I'm seeking is a soul, you could consider me a demon
Dreaming of a fuckboy massacre, bitch, I'm scheming
Bitch, I'm steamin' up some weed
And I'll be damned if you is reaching for this blunt your bitch rolled laced with your homie's ashes
I'm teasin', meaning I told your bitch that we would fuck, but didn't for no reason
Please and thank you when I drop a track
My audience is a bunch of zombies teamin' up to try and stop me
Tony told me it was chopper season, leave you screaming for yo' mommy, uh

[Segue: RUBY DA CHERRY]
Spray 'em with that Tommy, then I spray 'em with that Tommy
Mmm, you smell good for a dead motherfucker ($uicide)
Mmm, you smell good for a dead motherfucker (59)

[Chorus: $CRIM]
Hunnid blunts to the face, hunnid cups of the bale
Hunnid blunts to the face, hunnid cups of the bale
Hunnid blunts to the face, hunnid cups of the bale
Hunnid blunts to the face, hunnid cups of the bale
Hunnid blunts to the face, hunnid cups of the bale
Hunnid blunts to the face, hunnid cups of the bale
