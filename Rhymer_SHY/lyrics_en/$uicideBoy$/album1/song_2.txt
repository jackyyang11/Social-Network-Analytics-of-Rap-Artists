Load up my big nine, now I'm finna shoot to kill
If you bustas slippin', it's this .50 finna do the deal
Load up my big nine, now I'm finna shoot to kill
If you bustas slippin', it's this .50 finna do the deal
Load up my big nine, now I'm finna shoot to kill
If you bustas slippin', it's this .50 finna do the deal
Load up my big nine, now I'm finna shoot to kill
If you bustas slippin', it's this .50 finna do the deal

[Verse 1: YUNG PLAGUE]
Straight outta hell, ring the bells, Plague is here to stay
Roaches and locusts, they cover me
No halo hovering, follow me in yo' grave
Ain't got no Patek because I'll be here 'till the end of fucking times
Thy kingdom come; thy will be done
And still you wonder, "who am I?"
I am the devil's son, born and raised
Preaching $uicide, googly eyes
"Tell me more!"—okay
Praise the fucking devil, God can suck my dick
I scorch the plains
Making mountains crumble, glaciers meltin', oceans swellin'
I'm lord of the plagues
Load up my—
Wait a fucking minute, I got more to say
Threatening swordplay
Some would say nay, 'cause the tip of my sword's blade dipped in chlordane
Lil Plague breaking fortés
$carecrow in the corn maze, haunting board games
For war, we pray
Plague is cold in Norway
Hanging from the doorframe with sores and stains
For war, we pray
7th Ward, the grey
For war, we pray
7th Ward, the grey
For war, we pray
7th Ward, the grey
For war, we pray

[Verse 2: LIL CHOPPA]
Death is inevitable
The fucking $carecrow walkin' on his tiptoes
On your blood-stained wood floor, you know, mister typical
Hearin' the fucking voices through my window
(Begging to be dead!)
But no worries
Just like Chucky, Cut Throat got the blade, and the knife
May thy rise for the Yung Christ—never even died
My father just forsaken, I
I'm still $uicide until I die
It's an eye for an eye
Speaking of I, I— (someone help me out...)
See the reaper having a busy season
Won't even let me rest, while I'm sleeping
It's gettin' harder to watch from the bleachers
The father of evil
Like Knievel, Ruby and I stay jumping over people
Xanax eatin', close to lethal
Cigarette breathin' junkie, used to needles
So I grew up a fuck-up (Pow! pow! pow! pow!)
Load the nine up, my time's up, yeah (Yeah, yeah)

[Outro: LIL CHOPPA & Lil Gin]
Grew up a fuck up
Load up my big nine, now I'm finna shoot to kill
Load the nine up (Fuck all this shit)
If you bustas slippin'
(My time's up, fuck)
It's this .50 finna—
