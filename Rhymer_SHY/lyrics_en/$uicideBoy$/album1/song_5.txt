[Verse 1: LORD OF LONELINESS]
Uh, local boy makin' fuckin' global noise, yes I came to destroy, ayy
Sold out shows 'round the globe twice
Now I feel like a fucking viceroy, I do
Never say no to whatever drugs, I always enter the void
When it is time that I die, make sure I'm buried in FTP corduroy
$uicideboy$, most avoided, most ignored
I like their old stuff from before (I do)
Who am I, Freud?
I'm not who I thought I was anymore

[Hook: LORD OF LONELINESS]
I'm not, like you
I'm not, like you
I don't want the life you live (I'm not)
I don't want the wife and kids (like you)
I don't want to die and miss (I'm not)
All the things that sailed around me (like you)
I don't want the life you live (I'm not)
I don't want the fucking kids (like you)
I don't want to die and miss (I'm not)
All the things that sailed around me (like you)
I don't want the life you live (I'm not)
I don't want the fucking kids (like you)
I don't want to die and miss (I'm not)
All the things that sailed around me (like you)

[Verse 2: BANNY DA PINT DRINKER]
Ask me if I'm happy, stupid motherfucking question (hold up)
No pity needed fighting grown men, I was seven
"What's happening—?"
Runnin' drugs up on my bike, you know I had a weapon
Then them drugs became my obsession
Nobody can say they gave me a fucking thing (yuh)
Got out from the mud, now I'm a G-O-D, hold up
Born Southside, West Bank livin' legend
Reborn Yung Christ, this your fucking day of reckoning

[Hook: BANNY DA PINT DRINKER]
Northside Shawty off the porch sippin' dip
Lil $lick wanna quit, life overrated as shit
Everyday eating sticks, gotta wash it down
And when I wash it down, you know what it's with (bitch)
I just want some happiness, to live a normal life again
Sleep late and do nothing
Talk with my cousin, like he actually my cousin (I said)
I just want some happiness, to live a normal life again
Sleep late and do nothing
Talk to my cousin, like he actually my cousin
