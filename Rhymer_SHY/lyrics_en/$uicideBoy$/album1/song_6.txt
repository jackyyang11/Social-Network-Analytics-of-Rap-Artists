[Verse 1: BIG GRIEVE]
Creepin' out the motherfucking tomb
Lil $lick been cursed since the womb
Ridin' in the 'Vette in the projects
Couple pills in me with a cocked TEC
Trigger finger itchin' from the Hi-Tech
Junkie with a $uicide mindset
Aimin' for a motherfucking cops head
Murder, murder, murder! Now they're all dead! (huh?)
Burnin' a crucifix, spit on your grave, lil' bitch
$carecrow don't give a fuck, fuck!
Eyes rollin' back as I'm whipping the 'Llac
We the sharks and we smell some, blood!
Underwater, full of slaughter
Grey*59 the God's of horror
Kill the priest and burn the altar
See the grey's creeping out the corner

[Verse 2: YUNG MUTT]
Pussy tryna throw some shade, but I'm shruggin'
Throw shade at Ruby
You gon' have to find a way to block out the sun or somethin'
Now that pussy boy strugglin'
Mutt in his bitch, got that pussy boy wonderin'
Cut in his wrists got that pussy boy stumblin', uh, yuh
All these suckers wanna hate, I ain't gon' lie it makes my fuckin' day
If it fucking escalates, hand Yung Simmie a banana clip
Yelling out "R.I.P!" as the chopper spray, ayy
7th Ward Lord got a grave full of fuckboys buried by the lake
7th Ward Lord gotta pay if you wanna be a boss hog instead of a fuckin' slave

[Verse 3: Yung Simmie]
I'm 'bout whatever you 'bout
These niggas talking just running their mouth
I'm a block boy, I came from the south
I'ma kick it with your girl, then I'm kicking her out
Niggas hating on my name, when they know what I'm 'bout
I've been that nigga; I can be your bitch clout
I was smoking Cali weed, thought it was a drought?
I been had golds in my mouth
I been Mac'd up
Fucked your girl at your house
Had my feet on your couch
Left the condom wrapper out
Rap niggas all talk, fuck gossip
I'm a real nigga, I be all about my profit
I pull up, do me, you don't do enough
I be smoking OG I be in the cut
Simmie, Simmie, two times, two double cup
If you run up on me, I'ma fuck you up
Nigga, what is up?
