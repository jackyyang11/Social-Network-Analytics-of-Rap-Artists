[Intro]
Free GuWop!
So icy

[Chorus]
Man I got the call this morn', hit me on my mobile phone
They say Gucci comin' home, Gucci comin' home
I'm like, "Damn it's been too long, we been waitin' all along"
When is Gucci comin' home, Gucci comin' home?

[Verse 1]
You can call up all the blogs, tell 'em Gucci comin' home
I might buy an ice cream truck and hand out cones in every zone
Say she don't know big GuWop, bitch you need a chaperone
I might sneak that nigga out if his release just get postponed
When I touch down in L.A. you know that weed is on the scale
And that shit so fuckin' loud that you might hear before you smell
I'm with dark skinned, white girls, Spanish girls as well
I pull up on Dre in Compton, send my Beats Pill in the mail
What the fuck? Roll another one, light another blunt
They say Gucci comin' home, it's 'bout to be another month
On that bullshit, fuck the law, we need another judge
Man if Gucci comin' home then we don't need no Donald Trump

[Chorus]
Man I got the call this morn', hit me on my mobile phone
They say Gucci comin' home, Gucci comin' home
I'm like, "Damn it's been too long, we been waitin' all along"
When is Gucci comin' home, Gucci comin' home?

[Verse 2]
Okay now drop a four for Gucci when he come home for this
This for my girls, they super freaky, like to twerk on the dick
You want this pussy on the Snap then you gon' work for this pic
All of my bitches super bad and they all got their own shit
She a boss ass bitch and she got her own business
She a Gucci girl, she live in a Gucci world
She a boss ass bitch and she got her own business
She a Gucci girl, she live in a Gucci world

[Bridge]
Gucci comin' home, Gucci comin' home
Gucci comin' home, Gucci comin' home

[Chorus]
Man I got the call this morn', hit me on my mobile phone
They say Gucci comin' home, Gucci comin' home
I'm like, "Damn it's been too long, we been waitin' all along"
When is Gucci comin' home, Gucci comin' home?
They say Gucci comin' home, Gucci comin' home
When is Gucci comin' home, Gucci comin' home?
