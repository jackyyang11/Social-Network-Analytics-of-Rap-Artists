[Intro: BiA]
BOBBY.... BOBBY.... BOBBY....

[Hook: Future]
Pool full of money and I'm bout to drown
I'm a fool on the corner with that Bobby Brown
Presidential Rollie and its flooded
Fool on the corner with that Bobby Brown
Fool on the corner with that Bobby Brown
Fool on the corner with that Bobby Brown
Fool on the corner with that Bobby Brown

[Verse 1: BiA]
Who the fuck said they been gettin' to that money?
Out here boy that shit is unheard of
Everyone you see me with
Bet they ain't sayin' shit if they witness a murder
Wipe down the clip, we on point like a cursor
When you know the plug, you don't talk to the server
The Feds think they on when they watch my horn
But I guess that bitch wrong because this one's a burner
(You know it)
I think I'm sick of these rappers
That talk about trappin' but showin' no urgency, oh shit
I come from Boston
Where niggas will do you like Bobby and off your security

[Hook: Future]
Pool full of money and I'm bout to drown
I'm a fool on the corner with that Bobby Brown
Presidential Rollie and its flooded
Fool on the corner with that Bobby Brown
Fool on the corner with that Bobby Brown
Fool on the corner with that Bobby Brown
Fool on the corner with that Bobby Brown

[VERSE 2: BiA]
Pool full of money I'm saving
I dive in like Amen, Can I get a witness
One thing you can be is broke
But two things you won't be
Is broke and in my business
I left that mall with that white Chanel bag
Now like that's what I call New edition!
Can't fuck a check up like Nick
When you acting suspicious looking for forgiveness

[Hook: Future]
Pool full of money and I'm bout to drown
I'm a fool on the corner with that Bobby Brown
Presidential Rollie and its flooded
Fool on the corner with that Bobby Brown
Fool on the corner with that Bobby Brown
Fool on the corner with that Bobby Brown
Fool on the corner with that Bobby Brown

[BRIDGE: BiA]
I'm sipping brown, I'm coming down
I'm young and high, I'm filthy rich
Mix Barry white, with Bobby brown
Now pass around that Trilla shit
I'm sipping brown, I'm coming down
Filthy rich
Filthy rich
Now pass around that Trilla shit
I'm sipping brown
Filthy rich
Filthy rich
Now pass around that Trilla shit

[Hook: Future]
Pool full of money and I'm bout to drown
I'm a fool on the corner with that Bobby Brown
Presidential Rollie and its flooded
Fool on the corner with that Bobby Brown
Fool on the corner with that Bobby Brown
Fool on the corner with that Bobby Brown
Fool on the corner with that Bobby Brown

[Outro: BiA]
I feel like Bobby in '80
For all the wrong reasons I'm Hated
Maybe I'm arrogant, maybe I'm flagrant
But my prerogative the reason I made it
(Tell em)
