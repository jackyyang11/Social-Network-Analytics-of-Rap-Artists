[Verse 1:]
All this sauce on me is uncontrolable
All this K on me, this ultra sound is extra audable
Niggas tryna play that game, I ain't no carnaval
LA got me going vegan, I ain’t no carnavor
He still take me to the stake house, bitch, what you dining for
I just had a lot of dinners, now I'm in the diamond store
Too busy in the studio, like, what you grinding for
You ain't spending what you making, nigga, what you grinding for

[Hook:]
My hundreds blue, but my shoes are pyrule
How I spend it, you can tell I’ve got a few
It's a coop, I ain't got no sunroof
Save that money, you know, right in the roof
Big bank, had to swap the little bank
Lost a couple friends, but I never lost count
Love a blue face, smurfs all in my acount
Heard that money talks, so I had to talk loud

[Verse 2:]
I like collecting smurfs, but I ain't talking bout cartoons
Bitch, I been about this money, way up in my mama woom
Now I'm really going up, it's like I'm smoking healiom
See my haters stuntin like me, that's alright, I’m amune
I can make a hit, even with no autotune
Missin them days when all I had was obsticals
Now I’m eating lobster tails, somewhere it's tropical
If we talkin bout this money, I don’t here a lot from you

[Hook:]
My hundreds blue, but my shoes are pyrule
How I spend it, you can tell I've got a few
It's a coop, I ain't got no sunroof
Save that money, you know, right in the roof
Big bank, had to swap the little bank
Lost a couple friends, but I never lost count
Love a blue face, smurfs all in my acount
Heard that money talks, so I had to talk loud
