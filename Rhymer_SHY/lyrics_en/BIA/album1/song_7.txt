(Intro)
You fuckin' up my fungshway!
'Shway, 'shway, 'shway, 'shway, 'shway
You fuckin' up my fungshway, 'shway, 'shway, 'shway
'Shway, 'shway, you fuckin' up my fungsh...

[Verse 1]
Now I'm all out in L.A! Now I'm all out in L.A!
They just gon' see me tomorrow, if they ain't gon' see me today
Rolled another joint of dope, rolled another joint of dank
All the weed that I smoke, Hennessy what I drink
Did a few shows in Atlanta and Houston
I still ain't met one man that don't wanna choose me
I still ain't had one rapper talk to me loosely
Just got off flight, I sat right behind Boosie
That's word to my mama, RIP Bankroll right now and all summer
Our total won't come back if it ain't no comma
I told 'em don't worry, my fungshway my karma
Two things I won't be is in debt and in drama

[Chorus]
I cannot kick it wit' you, get out my face
I can't trust you, I don't want you in my space
If you goin' broke, no I can't relate
I can't have you here, you fuckin' up my fungshway, hey
You fuckin' up my fungshway, hey
You fuckin' up my fungshway, you fuckin' up my fungshway
You fuckin' up my fungsh...

[Verse 2]
I might wake up in The Bean, might spend my night in The Bay!
I'll bring it home like LeBron, they gon' throw me a parade
Fuck what them broke bitches talkin', fuck what them broke bitches say
Mama gave birth to a Leo, stunt on a bitch every day
Comin' down ridin', I parked right on Highland
I picked up my homegirl Wi Ling Ling
She do designer and bling bling
Panda fur on the McQueen ting
Got me a plug in Colombia, now I'm the closest thing out to a queenpin
Got my two phones goin' ring ring, bookin' fees soundin' like ching ching

[Chorus]
I cannot kick it wit' you, get out my face
I can't trust you, I don't want you in my space
If you goin' broke, no I can't relate
I can't have you here, you fuckin' up my fungshway, hey
You fuckin' up my fungshway, hey
You fuckin' up my fungshway, you fuckin' up my fungshway
You fuckin' up my fungshway, 'shway, 'shway, 'shway
'Shway, 'shway, you fuckin' up my fungsh...
