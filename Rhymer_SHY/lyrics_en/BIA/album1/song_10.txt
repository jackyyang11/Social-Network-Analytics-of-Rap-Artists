[Intro]
Murda on the beat, so it's not nice

[Chorus]
I’m Hollywood (Hollywood)
‘Cause I can’t trust my friends in Hollywood (‘cause I can’t trust my friends no more)
Up in the hills, no that’s my neighborhood (neighborhood)
Can’t trust no nigga like they say you could
(Can’t trust no niggas like they say you could)
I’m Hollywood (Hollywood)
‘Cause I can’t trust my friends in Hollywood (‘cause I can’t trust my friends no more)
Up in the hills, no that’s my neighborhood (neighborhood)
Can’t trust no nigga like they say you could
(Can’t trust no niggas like they say you could) (That's right)

[Verse 1]
East coast shawty but right now I’m on the west
He know I'm not from out here by the way that I be dressed
I got rich white friends so you know I got connects
And I came with there white girls that all fuck with percocets
Take your phone off the speaker if you think ’bout callin’ me up
And be careful how you speaking, bitch, [?]
If you ever have a problem you should think before you speak up
I too cute out here to fight but will pay to get your heat up
I’m well known (I’m well known), I'm well hated (I'm well hated)
I just want a house in Hollywood that’s gated
I just want a man my homegirls haven’t dated
I just wish the hype with you wasn’t overrated (overrated)

[Chorus]
I’m Hollywood (Hollywood)
‘Cause I can’t trust my friends in Hollywood (‘cause I can’t trust my friends no more)
Up in the hills, no that’s my neighborhood (neighborhood)
Can’t trust no nigga like they say you could
(Can’t trust no niggas like they say you could, say you could)
I’m Hollywood (Hollywood)
‘Cause I can’t trust my friends in Hollywood (‘cause I can’t trust my friends no more)
Up in the hills, no that’s my neighborhood (neighborhood)
Can’t trust no nigga like they say you could
(Can’t trust these niggas like they say you could, say you could)

[Verse 2]
Aye, 4am, homie open up the door (open up the door)
Yes I’m in the valley but I got no silicone
Everybody know me, I’m low-key but well-known
If your baby daddy fine you should get him off my phone
Crack his code if he sneakin’ and sleep out on the weekend
If you check his DM then you might just hurt your feelings
Got a lot of fake friends but got no time to see them
All these bitches talk to me I barely do the speakin’
Girl you wasted (you wasted), you so plastic (you so plastic)
You just wrote your doctors number on a napkin (wow)
You just moved to LA to purse your actin’
Bitch get off them blues you know you should be on aspirin (aspirin)

[Chorus]
I’m Hollywood (Hollywood)
‘Cause I can’t trust my friends in Hollywood (‘cause I can’t trust my friends no more)
Up in the hills, no that’s my neighborhood (neighborhood)
Can’t trust no nigga like they say you could
(Can’t trust no niggas like they say you could, say you could)
I’m Hollywood (Hollywood)
‘Cause I can’t trust my friends in Hollywood (‘cause I can’t trust my friends no more)
Up in the hills, no that’s my neighborhood (neighborhood)
Can’t trust no nigga like they say you could
(Can’t trust thses niggas like they say you could, say you could)
