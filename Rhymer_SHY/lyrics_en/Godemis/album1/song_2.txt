[Verse One: Godemis]
I'm too fly, Anakin Skywalk, space-bound
Huffing gas passed out in the field, face down
Thuggish motherfuckers unaware how stupid they sound
Tryin' push a bag of shake and telling me it's k.town, stay 'round
If he's holding I ain't gotta tell 'em
If the weight is right tonight we then the signs tryina sell 'em
I put the Deevil on 'em and told 'em I ain't never fail 'em
Now I'm doing dirt with him and pinning verses on the velum
The preacher tried to tell me I would never make it rapping
And then he sucked me off and act like nothing ever happened
I stuck a blade in him, he took it out I stuck it back in
Coincidence or not I think stranger things have happened
But that's it, I started teeing off, touching T&A
Taking shots, giving heaven hell to this very day
Deevil in the blue dress, tube test fetus
Tell 'em she's in here with us father, do come eat it

[Hook]
6 minits, 6 minits, 6 minits, Jason Dean your on
Let's get it on
In 6 minits, 6 minits, 6 minits, Jason Dean your on
Let's get it on

[Verse Two: Godemis]
Like I'm a suicidal psycho
Serving you semen sandwiches
That sort of counter-productive when I blaze up the cannabis
Wait, I murder them all like I'm stuck inside of the Animus
Showing up to surgery drunken with bloody bandages
And if it's a problem we probably promise them hell
Insidious, serenading my Devil's ghost in a shell

I'm too sick, stuck with this beef like it's fucking Ruth's Chris
All of ya'll can suck on a dick or choke on a toothpick
Makes no, difference to me I don't want to play with ya
Say you going hard, all I hear is a lot of labias flapping
I'm W-C with a Mack-10
And for me to think, I used to look up to them back then
But, now we on the road to riches which is the main theme
Madden-arms armory color coded and gangrene
Sipping with the bitches, and we fixin' to load a bong
And I got a couple minutes to burn up before it's on

[Hook]
6 minits, 6 minits, 6 minits, Jason Dean your on
Let's get it on
In 6 minits, 6 minits, 6 minits, Jason Dean your on
Let's get it on
