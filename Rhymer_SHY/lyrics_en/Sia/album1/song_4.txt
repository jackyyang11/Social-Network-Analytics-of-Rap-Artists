Can't find my car, I saw it just last night
I won't ask mom or dad
'Cause I can find this car all by myself
I'll use my eyes, I won't ask those guys
I look around like I'm the FBI
I know that I can do this
It's got to be where I last put it down
This living room is one small town

I'm getting warmer
I'm getting closer
I'm getting hotter
I am...

I'm getting near it, here I've got a hunch
And it's time for lunch...
Now my detective work is done, I want
I found that car, it wasn't hard
Didn't have to ask my mom
