Well I live here with you
In, in a kind of "yes, will do"
Oh what part of now don't you understand
I'm showing you well apparent
Yeah I get the bluff if I'll get out
No room for three, you, me and your doubts
One of us has got to leave
And it'll sure be me

[Hook:]
And I think we could have a situation
We could have a situation

Any reason we can't just settle around now
Yeah, ok, and how?
Rather than shout and praise
[?] with them, not without [?]
Oh, what part of our old tune don't you understand
I think I made it clear that you're in the mend
In the mend

[Hook:]
Oh, we could have a situation
Oh, we could have a situation
