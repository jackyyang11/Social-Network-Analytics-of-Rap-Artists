[Verse 1]
Beautiful calm driving
Deep sea pearl diving
Constantly unwinding
Beautiful calm driving

[Pre-Chorus]
You turned into another
You turned into a nutter
You turned into another man

[Chorus]
You're a stranger to me
You're a danger to me
You're a stranger to me
You're a danger
To me

[Verse 2]
Beautiful calm driving
Emotional hiding
Effortlessly shining
Beautiful calm driving

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus - Extended]
You're a stranger to me
You're a danger to me
You're a stranger to me
You're a danger to me
You're a stranger to me
You're a danger to me
You're a stranger to me
You're a danger to me

[Outro] (x8)
Beautiful calm driving
