[Verse 1]
You turned him down
And baby you fall
A little piece of you

And it's a piece left in tact
A part that won't act
But it's overdue

So, you could just fail
You could lower your tail
And just lay down to die

But a sliver of hope
And a dream to elope
So sees my good eye

[Pre-Chorus]
And I
I see your infinite and I
I see your definite
You push that shapeshifting smile
And as your defense falls
Like your castle walls
It comes crashing down
It comes crashing down

[Chorus]
But I heal you
You don't want love anymore
But you're drowning, oh
And I feel you
You shut love out evermore
Peace surrounds you, oh

[Verse 2]
So, you could just fail
You could lower your tail
Don't just lay down to die
