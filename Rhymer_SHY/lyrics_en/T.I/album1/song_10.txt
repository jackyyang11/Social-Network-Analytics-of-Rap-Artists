[Intro]
It's okay
Tomorrow'll be a better day
When ya rent a day late and ya tryna stay straight
But the only way to get it is to slang that weight
Okay, tomorrow'll be a better day

[Verse 1]
We all came in the world with a sparkle in our eye
Not knowing the only thing that we was promise is to die
But a promise is a lie can't nobody guarantee it
Cuz death around the corner can't nobody damn see it
I can't agree that God good at all time
But we all know shit ain't all good at all time
So I tote my strap in the hood at all time
Cuz respect ain't just something that's understood in our time
Especially by our kind man I hate it for the future
Police don't wanna lock ya up no more they wanna shoot ya
Ain't as half as bad as these hatas'll do ya
As soon as ya get ya loot up, ya body they wanna shoot up
Lord forbid they kill me I bet ya nobody knew what
But suckas get shot and polices come straight to us
Imagine how they do us ever since niggas blew up
I know ya goin through it know I'm goin through it too bruh

[Hook 1]
When ya rent a day late and ya tryna stay straight
But the only way to get it is to slang that weight
Okay, tomorrow'll be a better day

When ya daughter like 6 and her pops ain't shit
You don't wanna tell her you and momma gotta go strip
Okay, tomorrow'll be a better day

[Verse 2]
I'm doin this for the hood, the kid wit no dad
I was just like ya'll don't feel so bad
Know it's hard when ya live so bad
They whoop ya ass and they wonder why ya still so bad
For long ya get whoopin's and just laugh
Momma washin' clothes find lil' blue bag
She ask what ya what ya doin ya tell her stuntin' like my daddy
You knew that I was gonna be a hustla when ya had me
Look around ma you sent me to the sto' to get some bread
And I'm passin' at least 8 J's or mo'
Ya know the rent been late for 8 days or mo'
But slangin' blow a better hazard than 8 days of snow

[Hook 2]
When ya speeding wit the white and ya see the blue lights
And ya on ya 3rd strike so the judge say life
Okay, tomorrow'll be a better day

If ya son 14 and just died a folk criminal
Hard to realize it Baby girl but God witcha
Okay, tomorrow'll be a better day

[Verse 3]
My momma girl son 14 just got killed
Had to catch myself
Bout to tell her I know how ya feel
I'd been a damn liar
See her tryin not to cry
She know he in a better place
But she just wanna know why
Know somebody touch mine
And a nigga gon' die
It's goin down
I did tell her to calm down
I tried to convince her that he in God's arms now
She said I don't believe that there's a God right now
I know its hard right now and ya heart's light now
But God give new beginnings you can start right now
I know you're scarred right now cuz you apart right now
But shit he in better shape than we are right now

[Hook 1]
When ya rent a day late and ya tryna stay straight
But the only way to get it is to slang that weight
Okay, tomorrow'll be a better day

When ya daughter like 6 and her pops ain't shit
You ain't wanna tell her you and momma gotta go strip
Okay, tomorrow'll be a better day

When ya speeding wit the white and ya see the blue lights
And ya on ya 3rd strike so the judge say life
Okay, tomorrow'll be a better day

If ya son 14 and just died a folk criminal
Hard to realize it Baby girl but God witcha
Okay, tomorrow'll be a better day
