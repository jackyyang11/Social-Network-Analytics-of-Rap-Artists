Live and direct from the traps of the A-town, nigga
West side, Bankhead, nigga
Pimp Squad Clique, nigga
Grand Hustle, pimp
Say I'm mad, huh?
Your faggot ass gon' be mad in a minute (Sissy ass nigga)
(Hey, let's go, nigga) I'mma hit your faggot ass in the mouth when I see ya, nigga
Fuck what you heard, homie, leprechaun ass nigga

King of the place called home of the bass
He emerged at the trap, from the zone of the flake
Caught a case, and he still keep a chrome on his waist
For the haters in the face gettin' thrown in the way
Like a pussy nigga named Lil' Wesley, tryna test me
On your best behavior what your faggot ass best be
Choose words carefully when you address me
You ain't gotta like me, but you're gonna respect me
(Or else) or else you get wet like a jet ski
Take ten of these and live, that'll impress me
Say I wanna rap on your songs but you ain't let me
See you on the front of The Source, like that upset me
Fuck you in the ass, I ain't mad 'bout shit
Try Tip, shot quick, that's all your ass gon' get
And I ain't finna put a mask on, Flip
I'mma empty out the clip and your ass gon' flip
Bet your mom and your dad gon' trip
But them the consequences try to mash on Tip
Nigga, lyrically I'll murk you, physically I'll hurt you
You ain't never ran the streets, you had a curfew
Pussy nigga playing with me, you'll be in the dirt soon
Look you in the eye see you sweet like perfume (muah)
So go on, keep running you dick suckers
I'mma swing, show the world that you just a big sucker
Daddy shoulda got some head, bet he wish he woulda worn rubber
But he didn't, so now I guess the world gotta suffer
You the kind of wanksta, gangsta's done had enough of
So I'mma take pride when I ride through and bust you
Tip will be the reason for the saddest day your momma seen
When I let this K slay a nigga like the Drama King

Better find a nigga to try, nigga I ain't the one
I got 99 problems, Lil Flip ain't one (ha, hey, hey)
I got 99 problems, Lil Flip ain't one
This pussy nigga wanna beef well he find him some
I got 99 problems, Lil Flip ain't one (ha, hey, hey)
I said, I got 99 problems, Lil Flip ain't one
Fuck, boy you wanted beef, well you found you some
I got 99 problems, Lil Flip ain't one

[Lil Flip]
Scarface the king of the South

[T.I.]
Pussy nigga, shut the fuck up
I'm cool with Face and even he know that you're a sucker
Paul Wall runnin' Texas along with Slim Thug
Mike Jones, ESG, and Z-Ro some real hustlers
Never been a Botany Boy, you just a buster
Never been seen outside on the Southside
Sucka nigga puttin' on like you run shit
After Third go to jail with this leprechaun shit
Half the time you don't like what I'm saying then buck
Nigga, swing when you see me, nigga, I don't give a fuck!
Cause I know you just a lame and your partners ain't tough
Know your aim ain't shit and know your fight game suck
So I couldn't image you what G's would wanna listen to
Just some kids, women, and a lot of homosexuals
I'm a stand up guy man I'm into principle
All you do is lie, and everything you say is fictional
I demand my respect, I'll die about that
But I'mma hit you with the tek, and let you lie about that
So keep me out your raps or this shit ain't done

I got 99 Problems, Lil Flip ain't one (come on)
I say, 99 problems, Lil Flip ain't one
Pussy nigga wanted beef well he found him some
I got 99 probelms, Lil Flip ain't one

[T.I. talking]
