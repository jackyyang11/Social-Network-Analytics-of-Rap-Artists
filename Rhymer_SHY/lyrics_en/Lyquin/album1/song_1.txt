[Intro: Fat Joe]
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up

[Verse 1]
This summer dog, we turning all the way up
I've been clubbing and recording so it's getting hard to stay up
On this flight got my mileage up, so now they gotta pay up
Why we talking 'bout practice cause this shit right here a layup
Young Quin biased, but I ain't that biased
You know the flow cold, the pen so fire
Uh, progression rapping got to forming formalities
You gon' check my resume, all you see is fatalities
Let's get it real dog, we only focused on salaries
I be deep in that pussy, be burning calories
Always happening, never believed in gravity
All the pain and the struggle but that's what had to be
I got some Henny and coke in my cup
Smoking that OG in LA, got me stuffed
I got my city but that ain't enough
Flow on Viagra, I'm all the way up
So just keep expecting this shit, tip top effecting this shit
I know I ain't perfect but at least I perfected this shit
Straight into high school into the league, I'm projecting this year
Just call me majesty Quin, royalty all that I spit
Loyalty over the fame
Enough'll come over the name
I'm tryna tell 'em man, we ain't the same
When you got nothing to lose, there's so much to attain
Get texts like where you at, I'm with a friend or two
Once just came from UFC, she going back to finish school
Body like a sire, her lips like Kylie Jenner's do
Young Picasso, they cannot stop you
When you spin like this, they either buy or they block you
Tryna point out your flaws and when they can't, they still knock you
When you being yourself, ain't no way they can stop you
Bigger shit in store, plus the new shit gon' drop soon
Quin 'head stop, they know a nigga 'bout to pop
I can't wait 'til I can get me a new Bentley with the drop
I ain't never, never stop, I ain't never, never quit
Lot of people gave up on me, unexpected to but shit
That's just whatever, this is life, dog I swear I'm the nicest
Nigga this flow I got, this 101, this just priceless
Me I'm just fighting battle dog, this life is enticing
I can't be one of these niggas that get caught in a hype
Quick it's like, a lot of niggas, they get on and they life switch
Me, my shit is green, I do this for my team
Man I'm all 'bout that cream, man this shit like a dream
Give a fuck if you feel me, your girlfriend know what I mean nigga
