[Verse 1]
I'm that nigga, same old nigga
Ain't shit changed, name getting bigga
Hoes be choosin, hoochies be rooting
Fuck is you doing? Bitch start screwing
I ain't here to play games witcha or kiss ya
Bitch youzza flipper, be on them dolphins
Since the 8th grade bitch you been tossin
They used to call you choo-choo at Dorsey
Seen her at Stars? Yeah at the back doe
In and out the club? Yeah that's that ho
Kicking it with rappers? Yeah that's that ho
Fuckin with athletes? Yeah that's that ho
Anywhere the money is, is where the pussy go

Damn shame cause the bitch she still broke
