[Verse 1]
Oooh
Tell me
If you want me to say what's on my mind, baby
I can't keep it to myself no more
Am I out of line, baby?
I know that we've been talking alot
But just on the surface I wanna know if it's worth it
Come on baby let me know something
Showing up at your job just to see your face, baby
Feeling like a stalker
You should come on and arrest me baby
Been behaving badly
Since the moment that you had me
Hate to see what you've been making me do
Maybe you should buy a little restraining order
Baby, put the handcuffs on me
Take me down or take me now
Lock me up
Or lock me down

[Pre-Chorus]
Put me in your cell
Treat me like I'm in your jail
Boy, your crime I have committed
But if you with it

[Chorus]
I wanna spend 25 to life with you (Oohh)
Not even kidding, boy
25 to life with you (Oohh)
Only if you with it, boy
Take me now
(Oohh noo)
Cause I want to
Spend the rest of my life with you

[Verse 2]
I am a repeat offender
That is why I stay with you
You're the number one contender
Let me have my way with you
Evidence is clear
There's no room for error
Boy I fell for you
Boy you got me going through it
Going through it baby
Show up at your spot
(Just so I can get next to you)
Something like a superstar
Must've been Inside Edition
Flicking pictures everywhere you are
You should know
I'm gonna get caught
Catch me if you can
You should buy
Buy a little restraining order
Baby put the handcuffs on me
Take me down or take me now
Lock me up or lock me down

[Pre-Chorus]
Put me in your cell
Treat me like I'm in your jail
Boy your crime I have committed
But if you with it

[Chorus:]
I wanna spend 25 to life with you (Oohh)
Not even kidding. boy
25 to life with you (Oohh)
Only if you with it, boy
Take me now
(Oohh noo)
'Cause I want to spend
The rest of my life with you

[Verse 3]
I'm willing to go before the judge
And testify my love
And put me on the stand
And I'll tell them you're the man
That I wanna spend my life with
I'll be your ride or die chick
Call up the reverend and
Baby I'm gonna tell him that
I do love you and if you love me too
Just say I do
And kiss you right
Let the people throw the rice
Honeymoon on an island
Baby you and I can stay 25 to life
Buy a little restraining order
Baby, put the handcuffs on me
Take me down or take me now

[Bridge]
Lock me up
Or lock me down
Put me in your cell (Baby)
Treat me like I'm in your jail (Oohh)
Lock me up
Or lock me down
Put me in your cell (Baby)
Treat me like I'm in your jail (Oohh)
Boy your crime I have committed
But if you with it
I wanna spend 25 to life with you (Oohh)
Not even kidding boy (Just make it more)

[Chorus]
25 to life with you
Only if you with it, boy
Take me now (Oohh no)
'Cause I want to spend
The rest of my life with you
