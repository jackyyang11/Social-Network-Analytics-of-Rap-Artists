[Verse 1]
Can somebody explain to me
Why everybody is tryin' to be
Livin' like a celebrity
Doin' what they see on MTV
Ice is cool but I'm looking for more
Simple things is what my heart beats for
Cause that's me
I don't ask for much
Baby, having you is enough

[Chorus]
You ain't got to buy nothin'
It's not what I want
Baby it's you
We don't have to go nowhere
It's not what I want
Baby it's you
It's not 'bout what you got
I know you got a lot
No matter what you do, you always get it hot it's you, it's you
Baby all I want is you, yeah

[Verse 2]
It don't matter that your car is fly, fly
And your rims are spinnin' on the side, and
It don't matter where we go tonight
Cause if I'm with you I'll be all right
That's cool, but I'm lookin for more
It's your love that my heart beats for
Cause that's me
Don't have to spend a dime
Baby
I just want your time

[Chorus]
You ain't got to buy nothin'
It's not what I want
Baby it's you
We don't have to go nowhere
It's not what I want
Baby it's you
It's not 'bout what you got
I know you got alot
No matter what you do, you always get it hot it's you, it's you
Baby all I want is you, yeah

[Outro]
You ain't got to buy nothin'
It's not what I want
Baby it's you
We don't have to go nowhere
It's not what I want
Baby it's you
It's not 'bout what you got
I know you got alot
No matter what you do, you always get it hot it's you, it's you
Baby all I want is you, yeah
