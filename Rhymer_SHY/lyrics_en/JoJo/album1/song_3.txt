[Intro]
All I want is everything

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I get overwhelmed
There are so many dreams that I have for myself
Some say I won't persevere
But their words and their ignorance can't interfere
'Cause I know that my drive exceeds circumstance
And my passion is clear when I'm given a chance
So, hate on me hater, turn down the fader
I wanna break down the walls, matter of fact
I want it all

[Chorus]
I wanna be the one, I wanna be on top
I wanna taste the sun, I wanna never stop
I wanna light the sky
Overall really, all I want is everything
I wanna touch the stars, I wanna feel the fire
Wanna speak my mind, I wanna be inspired
I wanna make a change, in the end really
All I want is everything

[Verse 2]
Who says that your goals are mere fantasies?
Promise you won't lose focus from their jealousy
'Cause our world, is in our hands
We gotta mould it and colour and shade
No reason why we can't
We can have it all

[Chorus]
I wanna be the one, I wannna be on top (Oooooo)
I wanna taste the sun, I wanna never stop
I wanna light the sky, overall really
All I want is everything (I just want everything)
I wanna touch the stars, I wanna feel the fire (I wanna feel the fire)
Wanna speak my mind, I wanna be inspired (Oooooo)
I make a change, in the end really
All I want is everything (In the end all I want is everything)

[Bridge]
I want the city streets, I want the picket fence
I want my privacy, I want the camera lens
I want my beethoven, I want some rock and roll
I wanna be the first and last (aaahhhh)
I wanna stay at home, I wanna see the world
I wanna date around, be your only girl
I wanna doctorate, still be rockin' it
Is that too much to ask
Tell me

[Chorus]
I wanna be the one, I wannna be on top
I wanna taste the sun, I wanna never stop
I wanna light the sky, overall really
All I want is everything (Wooooooaaaaaahhhhh)
I wanna touch the stars, I wanna feel the fire (Feel the fire)
Wanna speak my mind, I wanna be inspired (Speak my mind, be inspired)
I make a change, in the end really
All I want is everything (All I want is everything)
I wanna be the one, I wannna be on top (Onnnnneeeee)
I wanna taste the sun, I wanna never stop (Never stop)
I wanna light the sky, overall really (Overall really)
All I want is everything (All I want is everything)
I wanna touch the stars, I wanna feel the fire (All I that want, All I that need)
Wanna speak my mind, I wanna be inspired
I make a change, but in the end really
All I want is everything (In the end really all I want is everything)
