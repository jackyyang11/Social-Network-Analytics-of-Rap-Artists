[Intro]
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do

[Verse 1]
You know I don't know
What you do when you do what you do boy
But baby, baby, baby, baby
I don't even care no more
You got me so
Caught up in your spell, it's voodoo boy
Well baby, baby, baby, babe
I wanna be there for sure

{Pre-Chorus]
Cause every time that we rendezvous
I don't wanna go back home
And every time that I'm holding you
There ain't no way to let you go
You shut it down boy the game is through
I don't wanna play no more
Cause the only one that I want is you
So tell me what you wanna do because, baby

[Chorus]
Cause I just can't stay away
There's nothing that I can do
And baby, you can have your way
Just as long as I can have you
Cause I'd do anything baby, do anything for ya
Cause I'd do anything baby, do anything for ya

[Verse 2]
Now I've been told
That you got you a few and you ain't sure
But baby, baby, baby, baby
You gon' wanna let em go
Cause I've been sold
On you, I don't check for dudes no more
Cause baby, baby, baby, baby
You the way I wanna roll

{Pre-Chorus]
Cause every time that we rendezvous
I don't wanna go back home
And every time that I'm holding you
There ain't no way to let you go
You shut it down boy the game is through
I don't wanna play no more
Cause the only one that I want is you
So tell me what you wanna do because, baby

[Chorus]
Cause I just can't stay away
There's nothing that I can do
And baby you can have your way
Just as long as I can have you
And I'd do anything baby, do anything for ya
Cause I'd do anything baby, do anything for ya

[Bridge]
I'm down anything, boy you and me
It's the way you know it's supposed to be
Cause I would do anything for you, baby
I'm down anything, boy you and me
Should be doin' what comes naturally
Baby, cause I

[Chorus]
Cause I just can't stay away
There's nothing that I can do
And baby, you can have your way
Just as long as I can have you
See I'd do anything baby, do anything for ya
See I'd do anything baby, do anything for ya
Cause I just can't stay away
There's nothing that I can do
And baby you can have your way (Baby, you can have your way)
Just as long as I can have you

[Outro]
Cause I'd do anything baby, do anything for ya
Cause I'd do anything baby, do anything for ya
Cause I'd do anything baby, do anything for ya
Cause I'd do anything baby, do anything
