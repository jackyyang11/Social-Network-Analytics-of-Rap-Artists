[Chorus]
We stackin money to the ceiling
Im leaning while im sippin
Im ridin in that 2 door coupe
Thats yellow like the Simpsons
Im stumblin
Im trippin
Got hoes
So im pimpin
I spend it and I get back
Instead of catching feelings
Break a band
I break a band
I break a band
I break a band
I break a band
I break a band
I break a band
I break a band
I break a band
I break a band
I break a band
I break a band
I break a band

[Verse 1: Dreezy]
I chase a bag
I pop a tag
Got bitches mad
Im rollin solo
My hit is loco
I'm yellin YOLO
Blow a pack
I spend a a stack
I get it back
And I flex
We cuttin checks
Im getting neck
Im stuntin hard and my stacks up
Whack a bitch if she act up
So all my haters wanna join me
So we bought a pack and we matched up
I be on it like a missionary
Split hard like my swisher hairy
All my niggas be training gold
Like I picked em outta the military
All of my haters be under the radar
They claiming that life that i really be living
Blow me a rello dont blow A Capella
We stackin the money thats touching the ceiling
Yo nigga love me
He wanna be hubby
I give him no feelings
Unless he be knealing
My bitches thriliing
My niggas be drilling
I calling the shots
Eastiders be willin
Gone bitch Im woozy
Homie, toke that oozy
Not to brag but im poppin tags
So Im paid enough to be choosy
Suit cases say Loui
Let yo nigga do me
And he give me stupid brain like he smarter than Stewie

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Mikey Dollaz]
I break band
My bitch from France
She brought a friend to get it in
Im stackin ends
Thats on my mens
You niggas therms
I bet he learn
We he get burned
My gun will perm
My pockets earn
Im mikey turns
Im signing checks
This rap shit so easy
I murder shit
First degree I feel like Dreezy
We drill
Shit real
My block won't need me
She go
With no problem
This stomp box
Won't tease me
Im cooman commited
Smoke dope out that midget
Im rollin up blunts
My teeth steady grinning
My bitches be winnin
Im always be in it
To hell i be goin
Cause im always sinnin
Ridin with dope
Cause my windows
Be tinted
Bitches be goin
Thats head they be givin
Caught on the block
They know how im livin
Im cookin and flippin with bro in the kitchen
The way i got bars i should build me a prison
I won't spend a dime on these nothing ass women
And all I chase is money
And all I think is digits
Kush pills and patron
Got me stumblin and trippin
WAAAA


[Chorus]
We stackin money to the ceiling
Im leaning while im sippin
Im ridin in that 2 door coupe
Thats yellow like the Simpsons
Im stumblin
Im trippin
Got hoes
So im pimpin
I spend it and I get back
Instead of catching feelings
Break a band
I break a band
I break a band
I break a band
I break a band
I break a band
I break a band
I break a band
I break a band
I break a band
I break a band
I break a band
