[Verse 1: Dreezy]
Run around, I'm a underground gotta find my way like Hariett
Fell in love with the gang now I'm thinking maybe I should just marry it
Cinderella better than the fellas I'm a queen and I'm a need a chariot
?
I'll pop out with your main nigga make him spend a check if he ...?
Got my name tatted on his arm now you only let him wear long sleeves
You will never know when it's stakes out
?
You better think twice, when I'm in a fight I gotta nigga with me like Ray Rice
Tell the label I gotta cook a meal feed the fam like dinner time
They tellin me to go in...?
They televised and they tellin lies
I see through em like a ...?
And I'm the same me and getting money can't change me cause I been...?
Let's get it
[Hook:]
I start counting haters I got way too many
Always talking brands but you ain't breakin any
I know bitches hating but why niggas envy?
Queen of any city bitch you fucking with me
[Chorus:]
I'm a fucking boss, I'm a fucking boss (x4)
