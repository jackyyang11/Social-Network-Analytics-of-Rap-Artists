[Verse]
My freak
To do what it pleases
And she gon' drop it love and bring it to me
I put it on G's
Its only a few dollar signs
Whatever come between
And so I slide in to prove my point that she a skeeze
A beautiful one
If I let one go in her we'll have a beautiful son
Or respectable daughter
That's a bright future for some
But for the moment just roll it
And pop, pop on your gum
Watch your mouth 'cause its dumb
Watch your ass, its a plum
Watch you exit out the door
Beg for me, beg for me
Watch your wings when you fly away
Hummingbird won't you hum
And when you come watch your mind
Beg for me, beg for me
Sexually you got it gone
Actually I'm not at all
Amused by the way you ride
Right now you should write it off
Give me some charisma and equipment when you lock your jaw
But not to the point you blow
Bring back everything you sold (sold, sold, sold)

[Hook]
Shorty swing my way
You sure look good to me
Now would you please swing my way
Shorty swing my way
Shorty swing my way
Sure look good to me
Now would you please swing my way
Shorty swing my way

[Outro]
Its twenty, its fifty
Its a hundred, bring a little more
Its thirty, its sixty
Ninety, bring a little more
Twenty, fifty, two hundred, bring a little more
Hundred, five hundred
Now we're starting that show
Its twenty, its fifty
Its a hundred, bring a little more
Its thirty, its sixty
Ninety, bring a little more
Twenty, fifty, two hundred, bring a little more
Hundred, five hundred
Now we're starting that show
