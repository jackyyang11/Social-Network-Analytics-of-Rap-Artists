[Intro]
My freak
Yeah
My freak
Yeah
Look

[Verse 1]
My freak
She do what it pleases
I just wanna please ya
Good lord Jesus
Telling you I need this
Come here, strip down, exactly in that sequence
If you're talking swimming terms
Lets go to the deep end
Married to the nana
Had to make my fucking knee bend
Ooh la la la la la pussy more hot
Like soda shake it up
I spray it on ya

[Hook]
Oh my god (oh god)
This big old backside
Got a track record
For making me act right
For making me act right
For making me act right
(x3)

[Verse 2]
We freak
Whenever she pleases
Sometimes we just want some more
And bring another freak in
I'm freakin'
My god you're so freaky
You're leaking
No literally just like a fucking sink is
Farrah Fawcett
How you toss it
Never paid a damn dime to wear this costume
Don't want to lose it
Cause if I lost it
I would lose it
And that ain't bullshit
I'm an executive
Consecutive nuts
Every time I'm next to kitty
Man the kitty gon' nut
Queen bee a slut
King me enough
Yeah she mine, pretty, free
Baby my, free enough

[Hook]
