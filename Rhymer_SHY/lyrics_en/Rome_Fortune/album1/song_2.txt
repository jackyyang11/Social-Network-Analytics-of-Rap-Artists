I'm good on your love if it's 24/7
I know it sound crazy
But I still want you to come through when I need you
I know it sound crazy
I still be huggin' you tight and you be clingin' (?)
I know it sound crazy
Cause it's (?) with that ass up come touch me

I'm good on your love if it's 24/7
My schedule busy, I need temporary

I'm good on your love if it's 24/7
