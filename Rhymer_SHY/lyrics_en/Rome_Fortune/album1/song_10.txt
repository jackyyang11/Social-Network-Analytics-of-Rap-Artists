Cito on the Beat

[Verse]
I done sipped too much and called you up
But I need this nut, so I'mma try my luck
Don't need them lips if they ain't on "moi"
Don't need them lips if you can't say goodbye
I said my cup's looking very full
Now it ain't cuz she nigga pulled
Got some good weed, sip a good tree
So I can maybe put up with your bullshit
It ain't easy but you got some good shit
Live and let us but she's just a hood bitch
And I love that

So fuck me right and keep it quiet
(I'm bad for you)
So fuck me right and keep it quiet (I'm bad for you)
(I'm bad for you)
So fuck me right
(I'm bad for you)

[Hook x2]
I said you bad for me (hey)
So bad for me (hey)
And that's good for me
So gradually, you'll grab the D
And like what you see
We grown as fuck, communicate
You tryna fuck?
If not, I sure won't hate
So, we can line it up

Oh now I'm in too deep (x3)

[Outro]
