[Hook][x2]
Ho dropped to the floor like ayy
Five second rule, five seconds
Ho dropped to the floor like oh
Five second rule, five seconds
Still eat it, still eat it, still eat it, five seconds girl
Still eat it, still eat it, still eat it, five seconds

[Verse 1]
Round and round the round table
I’m around, stallions out of town stables
Pound for pound I’m damn able
Make em all rally up, understand cable
Turn it down, shame though, [?]
You got nipple rings and a nigga ain’t blame you
Back tats, back tats, aim shoot
Practice, practice, let it spray you
I said get off your high horse now baby
Little cigars, we’re treating them wavy
Hopped in vroom vroom to the crib on [?]
Beast on your body and a nigga stay eating

[Hook][x2]

[Bridge][x4]
I said drop it from 1 to 2, and 3 to 4
Five seconds, pick it up, eat it up

[Verse 2]
Hey, the rhythm is not broken
We in bed hitting pot, smoking
Baby girl keep your eyes open
On your knees, got your eyes closed

[Hook][x2]
