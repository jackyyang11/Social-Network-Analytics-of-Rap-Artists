[Chorus Rome Fortune]
I said let’s go, tippy toe
Why you in the same spot?
Used worry all night
Now it’s gon' be alright
Great job, keep it up
No lie, goin' up
Slow time, just enough
Now you see it’s alright
Now you see it’s alright
Now you see it’s alright
Now you see it’s alright, yeah, hey
Now you see it’s alright

[Verse: Rome Fortune]
Alright alright alright alright alright
Alright alright alright alright alright
Good God!
Here we go
I been grinding all night all night all night
All night all night [?] all day and all night
I I I I I I I I I I I(it’s hot!)
I dance to the pain
You cry ... Like a sucka!
Oh
I always take that pain in stride, like a mother
Sup [?]
Said said, the pain gon’ but me a big crib
The pain gon’ pay were my kids live
The pain done did like all of this
I gotta thank my pain that’s my best friend
That’s him, that’s him
You can stop guessing
Freshman, no freshman
Uh uh, I don’t need no guest list

[Chorus: Rome Fortune]
I said let’s go, tippy toe
Why you in the same spot
Used worry all night
Now it’s gone be alright
Great job, keep it up
No lie, goin up
Slow time, just enough
Now you see it’s alright
Now you see it’s alright
Now you see it’s alright
Now you see it’s alright
Now you see it’s alright
