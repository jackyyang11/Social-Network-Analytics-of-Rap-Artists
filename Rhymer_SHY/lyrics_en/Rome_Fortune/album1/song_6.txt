[Hook]
I've got to take it all the way
I've got to take it all the way
Bloody and limping I'm getting it all
This is no different I'm getting it always
Move from the bands 'cause it pushes you forward
Don't you forget that I get what I want
I've got to take it
All the way
I've got to take it
All the way

[Verse 1]
Me and my mama living in a motel
That ain't nowhere to be found
Listen nowhere
So much drama
I remember so well from that moment
Rome was taking no L's
Trying to row your boat
But your boat don't float well
In the river that you flowed (?) tears where to go now
Baby where to go now
Applied pressure to myself gotta say whoa now
Slow down
I was like ten
I had never rode in a Benz or had many friends
But I knew to get those dividends
At home alone with mama getting them
Yes
So I plotted
Diabolical plan, it was chaotic (crashing)
I'm like ok I got it
In the mirror like you the man in this melody

[Hook]
I've got to take it all the way
I've got to take it all the way
Bloody and limping I'm getting it all
This is no different I'm getting it always
Move from the bands 'cause it pushes you forward
Don't you forget that I get what I want
I've got to take it
All the way
I've got to take it
All the way

Gonna get it
Gonna get it
Gonna get it
Gonna get it
