[Verse 1]
This shit is crazy, I'm tired
And the race ain't started
I guess that's the feeling when you do it whole-hearted
Guess that's the feeling when you're really all in
But I ain't calling
Cause darling I'm working until the morning
I ain't killing time, sometimes you see it as that
Saying the time to say hello is time you're needing in fact
I could go throughout the day giving a fuck for nobody
But you will still expect attention 'cause you ain't just nobody
I hear it, I hear it
Said as I was cleaning my palate
You threw me off balance so quick I say so long now

[Hook]
I'm trying to find, trying to find my sanity
I'm walking on the thin line of vanity
I feel alone and unknown for too long
Are you understanding me? Are you understanding me?
I'm trying to find the exit at the entrance
I'm trying to make my exit my entrance
Does it make sense?
Are you understanding me? Are you understanding me?

[Verse 2]
I'm so uptight
Hit me up whenever you want to talk
I just don't want to be tied down anymore
You want the opposite
But I got to get these accomplishments
But hit me up whenever you want to talk
I just want you to know I'm giving this shit my all
I dream but I'm working more
You on a team in a different sport
I had to leave and that's (?)
So much potential ain't no coming short
You love me like a Christian love the lord
But I got to get this money
Signed, Rome Fortune

[Outro]
Ain't no place in a world that's so fake
Glad you're with me
And maintain the world for me too
Just don't you forget me
Doing everything because I'm focused
I need you to be too
Lord these hoes they be see through
Lord these hoes they be see through

Ain't no place in a world that's so fake
Glad you're with me
And maintain the world for me too
Just don't you forget me
Doing everything because I'm focused
I need you to be too
I know why these hoes they be see through
I know why these hoes they be see through
