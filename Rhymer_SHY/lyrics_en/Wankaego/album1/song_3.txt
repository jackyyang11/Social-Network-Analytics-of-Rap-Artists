(Chorus)
Everytime I turn around he lookin' at me
Talking bout how he ain't into trickin' but ain't really ratchet
Likin' all my photos on my instagram he picture happy
Told him, If he wanna give me something why he lookin' at me?
I'ma make it twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk(x2)

(Verse 1)
Say he got them bands homie, ima have to twerk for it
Say he want this pussy, ye gon have to work for it
For I put it on, I make him run ye gon hurt for it
Saturday night, i have him sunday mornin' up in church for it
Prayin' like, lord have mercy, cars and purses
Got these hoes poppin' and twerkin'
Shaking' when i'm movin' like i'm hurtin or som'thn
She a fine little thang shawty workin' with som'thn
Ye!

(Chorus)

(Verse 2)
I make it clap (ye)
I make it clap (ye)
I ain't from the nolia
But you know I make it clap (ye)
I bust it open when I'm right there in his lap (ye)
I got him open all he wanna do is talk (ye)
He wanna Project, she a good hood rat
She don't really give a fuck and said she took that, dick
Shaking' when i'm movin' like i'm hurtin or som'thn
She a fine little thang shawty workin' with som'thn
Ye!

(Chorus)

(verse 3)
I'ma make him pay for it, make him pay for it
Throw them dollas in the air i make him pay for it
He Talkin' nails in my hair ye i'm straight for it
Say he wanna pay some bills, I'll wait for it
Ye I'll wait for it
Shawty sure can get it, she got that ass she don't play
She a donkey wit it
She got them niggas goin ape shit monkey wit it
She go gorillas on the stage she a monkey wit it

(chorus)
