(Intro: Boosie Badazz)
They be like (x3)

(Hook: Boosie Badazz (x3))
They be like, You ain't got no money
Take yo broke ass home (x2)
They be like Yea when they song come on (x2)
They be like

(Verse 1)
Go, go DJ, that's my song, put that record on replay
If he lame, I ain't trynna hear what he say
He running game, tell him boy this ain't a relay
Oh my momma, I look good, Keep that drama
I ain't with it i'm good, came up out the hood
From a model, to a rapper with a clique
Now we all out in Cali gettin' lit
So if you ain't got no money take yo broke ass home
Wit all that, No I ain't get dough in all that
If he ain't spendin' fo sho i'ma fall back
If I ain't a trill bitch then what do you call that?

(Hook: Boosie Badazz (x2))

(verse 2 (Boosie Badazz))
Go, go shawty, like its your birthday
Yup we gon party, now get loud
Yup we go retarded
And if it ain't live, yup we gon start it
They be like, (Yea) When they song come on
(?) when they on patron
Got all, my ladies with me and we gettin' it on
So we ain't leavin' till six in the mornin
Is that cube zircon inside yo ice grills
Call these diamonds, but none of the ice real
Fake rolex watch it would not get the pass
Even if you got a knot full of cash, Nope, i be like!

(Hook: Boosie Badazz (x2))

(Bridge (x3))
If I ain't a trill bitch then what do you call that?
What do you call that?
