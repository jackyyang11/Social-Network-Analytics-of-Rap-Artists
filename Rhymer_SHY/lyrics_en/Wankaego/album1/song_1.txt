(Intro)
The royal pussy is clean your highness
Hahaha
I told ya'll niggas, I told ya
I'ma a queen bitch
But I do king shit
Trill as Kaego

(Pre-Hook)
He start trippin', i'ma put him in his place
He wanna kick it so I put it in his face
He wanna lick it so I ask him how it taste
Pussy smell so good he should put it in a vase

(Hook)
Flowers (x2)
I'm fresh out the shower
No towels
Pussy smell like flowers
Flowers, like flowers
I'm fresh out the shower
No towels, no towels
Flowers

(Verse 1)
It don't ever sour
Just look at that cat print
Black fist, my pussy got power
No lie, he lasted 3 minutes
But said that it felt like a hour
Gave me his will of fortune
And I didn't even have to buy flowers
No lie, pussies cookies on a platter
Dinner served, start eatin'
He bittin' on my apple
Like the garden of Eden
And I told him its forbidden
Didn't listen, now them juices
Steady drippin' down his chin
Got him beggin' to plea
And I got flowers all season

(Pre-Hook)

(Hook)

(Verse 2)
That's what he devours
Said he never ate it
I told him ok
But just don't be no coward
But he shat
Now he smell the (?)
Cuz i'm diggin' his (?)
How he think he love boosie
Got heart of a lion
He(?)and growls
No lie, suckers wanna lick the rapper
Soon as I start speakin'
But if I let him taste it
Niggas might start tweakin'
He follow me on IG
Told him if he trynna see
Put his face right in my book
And start readin'
I got em all tweakin'

(Pre-Hook)

(Hook)

(Verse 3)
January, February, March, April, May, June, July
I make him put the flowers in the pot
I make him treat it like he bout this
I told him tease it, beat it
Put it in the vase, no soft shit
August, all the way through September
October, November, December
These flowers he'll always remember
He got timber, in the winter
He fly south, when I tell him go down
He go way past the border
He fool around
But I told him that he can't plant no seeds in my ground
Unless he tryin' to water, all of my flower

(Pre-Hook)
Flowers!
