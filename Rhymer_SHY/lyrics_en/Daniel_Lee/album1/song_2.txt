[Verse 1]
I left out 'cause I never seen stuff much different
You don't know what you've got 'til it's come missin'
I need to get back to the land of pines
The cotton fields where the stars still shine

[Chorus]
If I got to take a train, plane, or road by road
I don't care long as I get home
Shoulda already been gone by now
If I get lost well that'll be fine
As long as I cross that Dixie Line
My heart and soul still knows where I'm bound
Brother I'm headin' south

[Verse 2]
I've been everywhere I've never been before
There's a lot of real nice places in this world
I need to get back to the place
Where the corn grows tall and the cows still graze

[Chorus]
If I got to take a train, plane, or road by road
I don't care long as I get home
Shoulda already been gone by now
If I get lost well that'll be fine
As long as I cross that Dixie Line
My heart and soul still knows where I'm bound
Brother I'm headin' south

[Bridge]
Hell I know where my heart and soul is
I ain't forgotten that I'm right all I know is

[Chorus]
If I got to take a train, plane, or road by road
I don't care long as I get home
Shoulda already been gone by now
If I get lost well that'll be fine
As long as I cross that Dixie Line
My heart and soul still knows where I'm bound
Brother I'm headin' south

If I got to take a train, plane, or road by road
I don't care long as I get home
Shoulda already been gone by now
If I get lost well that'll be fine
As long as I cross that Dixie Line
My heart and soul still knows where I'm bound
Brother I'm headin' south (south)
Brother I'm headin' south (south)

[Outro]
Train, plane, or road by road
Shoulda already been gone by now
