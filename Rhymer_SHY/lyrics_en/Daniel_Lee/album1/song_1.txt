When the sun goes down on the little town
They roll the sidewalks up
Make it hard to find a good time
Oh, but that never does stop us

'Cause, when it comes to cuttin' loose
We know how to hold our own
Buy our beer and gas at the Texaco
But the smoke is all home grown

We put our trucks in the mud
Trust in the Lord
Fall for the girls in the cut-off shorts
Sang a little Hank
Pour Jack in our Coke
And pass around the backwood tobacco

Work all week and make ends meet
Sometimes we barely do
Wish Uncle Sam would give a damn
'Bout folks like me and you

When it comes to kickin' back
Hell it shouldn't be a crime
If we don't wanna slow our role
Hey Lord we're runnin' wild

We put our trucks in the mud
Trust in the Lord
Fall for the girls in the cut-off shorts
Sang a little Hank
Pour Jack in our Coke
And pass around the backwood tobacco

Me and my baby on a Friday night
Sittin' on a tailgate, country fight
It's the kind of life that I like to live
It's the kind of life that I like to live

We put our trucks in the mud
Trust in the Lord
Fall for the girls in the cut-off shorts
Sang a little Hank
Pour Jack in our Coke
Fall for the girls in the cut-off shorts
Put our trucks in the mud
Pour Jack in our Coke
And pass around the backwood tobacco

And pass around the backwood tobacco
Pour Jack in our Coke
And pass around the backwood tobacco
