[Intro]
You ready?
This is the big time

[Verse 1]
I grew up where the world was simple an' slow
Learn right from wrong, work [?] though
There was never plan b just the path I'm takin'
Breakin' on through on the road I'm makin'
I knew one day I'd get my shot
So here I am to give it all I got

[Chorus]
This is the big time ready set go
Work so hard just to make this show
Burn up the lights it's time to shine
Put your game face on 'cause this is the big time
This is the big time

[Verse 2]
Ever since my boots first hit these streets
Had to scratch and claw, made me hard to beat
There were real early mornin's and late late nights
Had to put in the time just to get it right
Now it's time to make my stand
Gonna show the whole world justa who I am

[Chorus]
This is the big time ready set go
Work so hard just to make this show
Burn up the lights it's time to shine
Put your game face on 'cause this is the big time
This is the big time

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
This is the big time ready set go
Work so hard just to make this show
Burn up the lights it's time to shine
Put your game face on 'cause this is the big time
This is the big time ready set go
Work so hard just to make this show
Burn up the lights it's time to shine
Put your game face on 'cause this is the big time
This is the big time
