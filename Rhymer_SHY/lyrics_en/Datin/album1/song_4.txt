[Intro]
Uh oh
You hear that?
It's the roar!
Ayo DJ Shock
Who are these uncircumcised Philistines defying the army of the living God?
Let me at 'em
Watch these giants fall
God Over Money!

[Verse 1]
See these cats just wanna rap for them
I want them to see what I say in my lines like I close caption them
Vivid pictures to capture men
I want every rap I pen to be like an audio baptism
All I hear is aggressive rhyming without an ounce of substance or depth [?]
The depth that I am supplyin' from my pen
Is a depth that Poseidon couldn't even survive in (That's deep)
So tell the skeptics chime in
When this song is over they'll be testifying
They spit death, my lyrics are death-defying
Like a trapeze artist without a net to dive in
By brainstorms open up a floodgate of thoughts
That run so deep, hip-hop'll suffer major loss
I flush it out with my Creator [?]
Your favorite artist wouldn't survive if he tried to recreate an ark
Huh, let's go

[Chorus]
When it's time to go to war
I'm relying on the Lord
So the giants gon' fall
I'm defyin' all the odds
I'm never hide, and I'mma charge
And the giants gon' fall
When Goliath wanna brawl
I'mma aim, fire, then of course
You know the giants gon' fall
Hit Goliath with the sword
Hold his head high and then'll I'll roar
You know the giant, the giant's gon' fall

[Verse 2]
See the truth is, you dudes couldn't hang in nooses
This is dynamite with the fuse lit
The flow's like Boaz in chapter three of the book of Ruth
Ruthless, and them songs you makin' are useless
So I could claim king like that dude Tip
And stake my claim for a crown like a tooth-fix
But that is not why I do this, this dude spits
To lift His name higher than a Kung-Fu kick (Jesus)
I spit the Good News, you couldn't spook this
With an autotune, Gregory brothers YouTube skit
It's more than music
I'm just an instrument of God, and you can hear him echo in the acoustics
See I am not an Einstein at this
I write 'cause inside there's a divine Guy trafficking
Lines through my mind, yes He provides my raps
And designs every line to open blind eyes
That is why, I do, this

[Chorus]
When it's time to go to war
I'm relying on the Lord
So the giants gon' fall
I'm defyin' all the odds
I'm never hide, and I'mma charge
And the giants gon' fall
When Goliath wanna brawl
I'mma aim, fire, then of course
You know the giants gon' fall
Hit Goliath with the sword
Hold his head high and then'll I'll roar
You know the giant, the giant's gon' fall

[Bridge]
You know the g-the giant's gon' fall
You know the g-the giant's gon' fall
You know the g-the giant's gon' fall
You know the g-the giant's gon' fall
You know the g-the giant's gon' fall
You know the g-the giant's gon' fall
You know the g-the giant's gon' fall
You know the giants, the giants gon' fall

[Interlude]



Maintain my focus


Uh
Maintain my focus



Maintain my focus


Well I ain't done
Maintain my focus, and watch where I'm headed



Cause truth must be spread and the lies must get [?] so I


Yeah
Maintain my focus


Uh oh

Maintain my focus


You hear that?
Maintain my focus, and watch where I'm headed


It's the roar!
Cause truth must be spread and the lies gon'

[Verse 3]
I treat this beat like Jason with a machete close
Very gross, hacking 'till it doesn't have any pulse
Deadly flows, like flood waters and all your levees broke
Raw and [?] Colombian [?]
This is that fire that'll take cats higher
Than the stuff on on spoon over the flame of a crack lighter
Flow cold as an iceberg that can capsize the
Titanic, I'm [?] trying to baptize her
Reportin' live from the upper tier
Where you corny rappers couldn't make the cut, like a pair of rusted sheers
And you know DJ Official's up in here
The way he go animal on them drums, you'd think the muppets near
We keep them blood stained banners way up in air
Red-flaggin' like a Tampa Bay Buccaneer
We offer one that won for all, but we not musketeers
We the army of Christ, Wu-Tang won't bring the ruckus near
You ain't the best just 'cause you say so
Roast you rappers, full of yourself like Mr. Potato
Head, hip-hop is dead, and I don't listen to fables
You ain't makin' hits, them dee-jays are just on yo payroll
Lyrical [?] I squish 'em like Play-Doh
My bars are explosive like soldiers letting their grips on grenades go
My lips are like volcanoes, tongue twist like tornados
My verses earthquakin', and Datin spit hurricane flow
Yeah, but nevermind these raps dudes
Aye yo 'Fic, I'm just out here trya

[Outro]


Yeah
Maintain my focus


Uh
Maintain my focus


Yeah
Maintain my focus


Huh
Maintain my focus, and watch where I'm headed


Cause truth must be spread and the lies must get [?] so 
Cause truth must be spread and the lies must get [?] so I


Huh
Maintain my focus


Yeah
Maintain my focus


Huh
Maintain my focus


Yeah
Maintain my focus, and watch where I'm headed



Cause truth must be spread and the lies gon'
