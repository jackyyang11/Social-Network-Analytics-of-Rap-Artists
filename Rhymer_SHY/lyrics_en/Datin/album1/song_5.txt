We had enough, we had enough
We had enough, we had enough
Go head and be mad at us, ?

[Verse 1: Datin]
People see us with them ice grills in the videos and they mad at us
But the truth is we should be upset cus you ain't lookin mad enough
You thinkin it's a tough guy image cus you never seen believers like us I get it
But open your Bibles and it will surprise you cus you will see there's lots of tough guys in it
They say I am possessed and I'm evil cus I look like I am upset
But they're supplying this death to my people and that is something I can't accept
So what's it to you if my mood has been ruined and my attitudes like I'm through with this, homie I'm mad cus this music influencing crime in my hood and you dudes are excusing it
I guess you would rather I digress
Sit back and be idle in the name of love
And just watch the hands tick on the Timex
While the crime and the violence
Outside gets worse bullets flying thru where I rest
While the kids cook crack in the pyrex
To provide death to whoever's gonna buy next
I bet ya would..
But never that you better read His divine text
Cus it says that faith comes by hearing and it's apparent that faith in the music that they digest
It influences their mindset
And it produces terminators like SkyNet
So my mindsets been ready to fight yes
I've had enough so don't you interfere with my quest
Cause my anger is righteous
