[Verse 1: Datin]
Oh oh menace ah ah can can can I show
Man it hurts we just preach faith hope and love
Trying to bring people shouting
You can come as you are
Him with open arms Jesus receives you yeah
But there's people in this country fighting
Trying to make this message illegal yeah
They have hate for the ones that spread it
They would treat you like you preach evil yeah
Can somebody tell me how is that
The moor compass is out of wack
They say were looking down from our high horses
Telling everybody how to act
But is it really cause they got so comfortable
Sitting down in a pile of crap
That they now attack anyone presenting change
Trying to help them pull them out of that
They have delusions of freedom
They don't know that slave's the sin
That's why they abusing mistreating
The ones that can unlock the cage their in
But I know it's Satan on the low the hiss in the ear
Telling them His Holiness don't exist
They were so convinced
They rejected Jesus Christ then the holy scripts
They don't want no leaders no accountability no Jesus
We were warned that they hated Him
They hating us I'ma throw fear

[Chorus: Datin]
I still gotta give em truth
Even if it means a fate so ugly
But I preach it from a place of love
That is why they won't budge me
I opened up His word
And there's the truth that I found yeah
Homie you can't budge me
There's a way to love the one that lays His life down
Yeah yeah yeah
Homie you can't budge me
Homie you can't budge me
Homie you can't budge me
I'ma still give them truth
Even if it means a fate so ugly
Homie you can't budge me
Homie you can't budge me
I'ma still give them truth
Even if it means a fate so ugly

[Verse 2: Steven Malcolm]
Yeah no weapon formed against me
Shout never ever prosper
Boy you dancing with the wolves
We looking real Kevin Costner
2010 was the end yeah I began
Living soul livid
