[Intro]
I'll give you everything
And more

[Sy Ari Da Kid]
They know where I came from
Strangers show more love than the day ones
It's crazy
No need to look in the sky for a style when you made one

[Tokyo Jetz-Verse 1]
I come from nothing
Started out speaking my mind
I swear I, hated being broke
Just had a dollar and a grind
And no I, never liked attention
I'm just rapping cause I could
And then I gave it all away
This shit ain't get me out no hood
I started working, barely sleeping right
Cause rapping ain't gon feed me right
Just trying to get these pieces right
So mama can get sleep at night
But you it hit me like Tok you know it's time at night
And know all of your reasons like I'm tripping or I'm blind
But you stayed down
Fuck how much I played round
2 years I was out the game
I'll start back in the day now
Dropped DM and you ran with it
Funny I was joking like I missed your whole point
That's just what you on

[Sy Ari Da Kid]
They know where I came from
Strangers show more love than the day ones
It's crazy
No need to look in the sky for a style when you made one

[Verse 2]
I do shows and y'all sing along to every word
And til' this day, that's still the dopest shit I ever heard
Cause you believe in me, I ain't believe myself
You pick me up when I was down, my pride ain't let me ask for help
I wanna thank you
You did some shit I ain't do
I know I gotta win cause giving in some shit I can't do
And yeah I'm still the same to me
When y'all see the growth
That's why I let you in on everything, yeah
Y'all see the most
You see my vision
Just keep rocking, we gon make it through
Been here since day 1
Y'all the reason that I'm living proof
Appreciate it
Wanna let you know in every way, that y'all the reason I'm still going til this very day

[Sy Ari Da Kid]
They know where I came from
Strangers show more love than the day ones
It's crazy
No need to look in the sky for a style when you made one

[Outro]
I'll give you everything
And more
