[Intro]
T&K a monsta

[Chorus]
I got a big house, who is you stayin' with?
Can't fuck with petty niggas, who is you playin' with?
Sideways, you a hater or a fan bitch?
That money talk, Chris Tucker, what you sayin' bitch?
I got a big house, who is you stayin' with?
I got a big house, I got a big house
I got a big house, who is you stayin' with?
That money talk, Chris Tucker, what you sayin' bitch?

[Verse 1]
LV, give me this, that, two of those
New hundreds, blew me those, pull up with two hoes
Been bossing since way back, 'fore Ross had the Maybach
When Jams played on 8 track, I'm lyin', why I say that?
You know I'm playin' bitch, kicking it since the sand bitch
I said turn me up, would you understand what I'm sayin' bitch?
Know we independent, the fuck is a hundred grand bitch?
When you from the hood and you know how to flip a band bitch
I can't fuck with petty hoes with they hands out
So don't come around me beggin', tell 'em stand down
And if that nigga broke, it's a code red
That's a flag on the play nigga, man down
You know the red on the bottom, that's them CL's
Keep it on the DL, don't give these hoes no details
If girls find out, then we gon' call that shit a re-tell
'Cause she told him and we know damn well that he tell

[Chorus]
I got a big house, who is you stayin' with?
Can't fuck with petty niggas, who is you playin' with?
Sideways, you a hater or a fan bitch?
That money talk, Chris Tucker, what you sayin' bitch?
I got a big house, who is you stayin' with?
I got a big house, I got a big house
I got a big house, who is you stayin' with?
That money talk, Chris Tucker, what you sayin' bitch?

[Verse 2]
I got one, two, three, four, five different attitudes
If I'm pulling up, you know it's about a bag or two
I'm too real to kick it with the fake, wouldn't lie with you
Paper adding up, and I can show you what this math will do
I just dropped four features, run in for the walk-through
We sit outside the club, backend 'fore we walk through
Book twelve shows, and they got me on the brunch
You mean to tell I'm getting paid to have lunch?
You know I’m ratchet, I get paid for my hair too
Five six seven zeros to change my hairdo
And I just signed a bottle deal, what you drinkin'?
Looked at the check like what the fuck was I thinkin?
Pose for the 'Gram, hold this, give a shout-out
It's an extra two for every hour we let fly by
I never paid for no drugs and I be sky-high
So shout out to the plug, he keep me faded, call him tie-die

[Chorus]
I got a big house, who is you stayin' with?
Can't fuck with petty niggas, who is you playin' with?
Sideways, you a hater or a fan bitch?
That money talk, Chris Tucker, what you sayin' bitch?
I got a big house, who is you stayin' with?
I got a big house, I got a big house
I got a big house, who is you stayin' with?
That money talk, Chris Tucker, what you sayin' bitch?
