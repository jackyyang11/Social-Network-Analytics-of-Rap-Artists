I'm tryna fuck on the first night
I beat it up on the first night
We fell in love on the first night

Touching you till six in the morning

[Verse 1: Tokyo Jetz]

Just me and bae and ain't really gotta say why
And when we riding I be rolling he be right here
So when we lay up we get hyped here yahhh
Gave me a vibe and ain't feeling nobody
So when I'm chilling I be missing yo body
In the streets late night got my feet up
Looking like a snack so you know baby gon eat up

[Verse 2: Yung Booke]
Hmm, I'm looking for a real not the fake kind
Grip on her hair so my fingerprints on her waistline
No service can't call, text or FaceTime
I'm off air saved by the bell then go to Bayside
Yeah
And I know you heard through the grapevine
That'll take a nigga bitch before they take mine
Stop lying you're not ice so stop trying
Rare diamonds shinning bright leave you cockeyed
