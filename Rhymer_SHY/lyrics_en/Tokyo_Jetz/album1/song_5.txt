[Verse 1]
Crab shit, you can't make it if they didn't
Where them Old niggas blockin, like that shit gonna make a difference
When they hate you cause you shining
But act like they really fuck with you
Get em with they potnas, you see they don't really fuck with you
Get it on your own cause nobody owes you shit
Where you can owe a nigga paper but he'll kill you bout his bitch
Swear yo dog ain't yo dog for real
Hate to see you ball for real
Close to the top, where they can't wait to see you fall again
I'm all in, they rather see you beefing
Get popped make a status like
"I feel bad for the kids and they daddy"
Just to forget about you, they ain't
Thinking about your kids how you fed all yo people and
Took care of yo mama bills
This shit be for the moment
They faker than a bitch
Give Your homeboy your last, for that bitch to turn snitch
Cold world
Cut your nigga off, for your home girl
Now he fucking her, you should've said fuck em both girl
Aye listen, I just need a minute with my city

[Chorus]
Can we talk?
Hey listen, I just need a minute with my city
I wanna know if you feeling what I'm feeling
I wish that I could, and you would
Can we talk?

[Verse 2]
Where it's okay if he a deadbeat
He the one you fucking
And they don't want you to make it
You coming from nothing
And these hoes clique together because they hate you
But every nigga around wanna piece to think they made you
They all blame bigga, they ain't blow yet
And radio ain't fucking with the locals shit we know that
Where You can't even chill in your hood cause they plotting
You keep your face clean and they still making you the topic
Where they hate you and they love you, just to hate you again
Well you can't trust your family, so you turn to your friends
When niggas lying on they dick
And they be lying to they bitch
You gotta worry about a nigga cause yo nigga like dick
Shit crazy in my city right
Pop done the city lights
The good die young so ain't no good in living right
Gotta keep it on you and just pray it never jam
I just need a minute
Need a minute, man damn

[Chorus]
Hey listen, I just need a minute with my city
Can we talk?
I wanna know if you feeling what I'm feeling
I wish that I could, and you would
Can we talk?
