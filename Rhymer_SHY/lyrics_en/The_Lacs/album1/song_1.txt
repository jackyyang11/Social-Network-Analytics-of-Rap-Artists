I'm back up in the saddle and I"m ready to ride
I've got a fifth up Jim Beam and a jug of moonshine
I'll be geeked all week on two days sleep
So go on and slide to the side of the passenger seat

Got the pedal to the metal can"t stop that diesel
With a tour bus full of straight partying people
Rollin 128 got to pick up the pace
I had to pass Jimmy Johnson just to take first place

I met Miranda Lambert at the CMA"s
She said I never seen a country boy rock this way
I don"t need to rehearse I"m just doing what I"m feeling
Muscadine, red wine and the Pabst Blue Ribbon

I could give a good damn about the money and the glam
Give me ole Johnny Cash and a beer up in my hand
I represent the real, the red, white, and blue
I represent the truth, 190 proof

(190) LAC Boys, LAC Boys
190 Proof, 190 Proof

Came crawling through the mud and we tripped up on a goldmine
Working on a buzz holler at me when it"s show time
Me and big boy pop a top and get it going
Got you reaching in your cooler you"ll be drunk before you know it

Yeah, we got drink smoke no passing out
We like to get the party started right around about now
I put the shots up on the bar and go to throwing em" down
And find a little country girl and maybe go for a round

So keep it country as a coon dog holler at my people tell em
Meet me at the pool hall it"s on for tonight
I"m gonna try and drink a case or two before the morning sun
And kill a half a gallon bottle go ahead and get it done
