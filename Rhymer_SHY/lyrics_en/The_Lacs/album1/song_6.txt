[Verse 1: Brian "Rooster" King]
It’s a long ride, long road
Long line of a lot of shows
Look close and you can see my crooked little smile
I’ve been dreaming about it my whole life
I think it put a few pounds on me
Ol' six string kinda sticks out on me
A bunch of fast food, a ton of Bud Light
Little sound check always keeps the band tight
Coast to coast doing shows for good folks
Man I love it but I never wanna see it snow again
Nothing in the world like a bunch of fans
Singing every line holding up the beer cans
Dear friends gotta roll but we had a blast
Need sleep and a couple of us need a bath
Hang out with the youngin's and my better half
Mama’s cooking me a honey ham

[Chorus: Craig Campbell]
Now I’m going back to Georgia
Just can’t wait to see that old state line
Now I’m going back to Georgia
Been laid up here got Georgia on my mind

[Verse 2: Clay "Uncle Snap" Sharpe]
The alarm clock’s ringing
Gotta get up, gotta go
But them boys still singing, gotta hit another show
I holler at my boys cuz you know we stay down
I try to bring em out every time we came around
Packing the bags and living outta suitcase
So bad on the road that the food tastes
Missing home and mama’s cornbread
It won’t be long until I’m in my own bed
I keep rolling and just play it to em' every night
I take a swig of the shine to get my head right
Chasing dreams right behind the headlights
A song is good for the soul if it’s said right
Ten more days and ten more shows
Got that rig stretched out
Let the black smoke roll
When we get back home no phones will ever find me
Wasting time way back up in the pine trees

[Chorus: Craig Campbell]
Now I’m going back to Georgia
Just can’t wait to see that old state line
Now I’m going back to Georgia
Been laid up here got Georgia on my mind

[Chorus: Craig Campbell]
Now I’m going back to Georgia
Just can’t wait to see that old state line
Now I’m going back to Georgia
Been laid up here got Georgia on my mind

[Chorus: Craig Campbell]
Now I’m going back to Georgia
Just can’t wait to see that old state line
Now I’m going back to Georgia
Been laid up here got Georgia on my mind

[Outro: Craig Campbell]
Got Georgia on my mind
Yeah, that’s right
