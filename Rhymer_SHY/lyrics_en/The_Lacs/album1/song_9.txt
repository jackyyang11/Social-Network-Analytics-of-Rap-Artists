You can ride shotgun buddy, I'll drive
Roll this one, we'll drink a little homemade wine
In a long dirt road, get some things off our mind
I need some country boy downtime
Small-town boys need room to breathe
Life can get rough and women can get mean
Call my dog, let's roll, I'm bout to lose my mind
I need some country boy downtime
I wake up early in the morning
Breath stinking as I'm yawning
Just another sunny day in backs of Georgia
See my buddy called me up, said he's running kind of late
But no rush man, I ain't going in today
Can you pick up my check when you get on a break?
Then holler at me 'cuz, when you head this way
Nah I ain't sick, I ain't feeling no pain
I might take the boat out, I hope it don't rain
I might catch me a fish, I might wash my truck
Hell, ride the four-wheeler, I ain't done that in months
Or build me a fire and cook what we caught
Or empty out the cooler cause I drank on the boat
Now we're shine time, talking bout the good old days
This uncle doodle and his good old ways
Got the fire bale glowing for most of the night
Can you smell the fat lighter?
This country boy downtime
You can ride shotgun buddy, I'll drive
Roll this one, we'll drink a little homemade wine
In a long dirt road, get some things off our mind
I need some country boy downtime
Small-town boys need room to breathe
Life can get rough and women can get mean
Call my dog, let's roll, I'm bout to lose my mind
I need some country boy downtime
Quitting time, had enough, I'm bout to lay low
Lot of folks like me just need a back road
Let the boat tide creep to a low speed
Feel that breeze, it's all G double O D, good
Beer stop by the river bank
Drop the tailgate and play some more Hank
Might sip a little bit and take the edge off
Hit the deep woods, riding shorty get lost
Sometimes it's in your best bet
To let your country hang out just like a redneck
Get loose, drink booze with friends
Make use of them til it's you again
You can ride shotgun buddy, I'll drive
Roll this one, we'll drink a little homemade wine
In a long dirt road, get some things off our mind
I need some country boy downtime
Small-town boys need room to breathe
Life can get rough and women can get mean
Call my dog, let's roll, I'm bout to lose my mind
I need some country boy downtime
