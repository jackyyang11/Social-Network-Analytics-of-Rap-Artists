Say tell me how you want too buddy
I'm a backwoods boy where you boots get muddy
A two path road to the left but you better not see it again
And I ain't never seen a Carolina sky
Where I didn't have to do it again
There's a big heart of gold
That black moon shine'n on the river
That black moon shine'n on me
That black moon shine'n on the river
That black moon shine'n on me
Black moon, black moon, black moon
Black moon, black moon, black moon
Theres the finer things in live like kids and a wife
Before see'n that black moon shine'n
Yeah, I listen to my pa as the days go by
Cause he says it's all about perfect timing
Got the old stan man runnin and the hooch still comin
Hope that old evinrude don't stall (don't stall)
If you need me just call
That black moon shine'n on the river
That black moon shine'n on me
That black moon shine'n on the river
That black moon shine'n on me
Black moon, black moon, black moon
Black moon, black moon, black moon
I'm just a river rat raised up on blackwater shine
We got a still in the field way back in the pines
See my pa taught me well and now its all mine
Got a drum filled with 55 gallons of time
(Ya) pumpin out tradition every minute it comes
White lightnin, pond water boy come get you some
Get a pint, mason jar or get a whole jug
Down by the river spreadin blackwater love
