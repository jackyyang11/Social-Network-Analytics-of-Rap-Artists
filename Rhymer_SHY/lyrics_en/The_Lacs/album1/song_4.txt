[Intro]
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America
And to the Republic for which it stands
One nation, under God indivisible
With liberty and justice for all
It's about that time, Rebelution (x3)
Yeah, it's time for the American Rebelution

[Verse 1: Clay "Uncle Snap" Sharpe]
A bunch of rowdy ass rednecks comin' up out them wood works
Savin' up all our paychecks, pumpin' up on that good herb
Holy jeans and muddy boots, yeah, you can check my footwork
I'm takin' names, it's plain to see, I'm kickin' ass 'til my foot hurts
It's time to ride and I'm on the scene, all the way live, I'm on the beam
I'm rollin' up, not holdin' up, I'm hoppin' out, tryna see the scene
Grab your guns, grab your knife, one more move, it's on tonight
Back us down, prepare to fight, country folks, we'll unite
Who y'all think y'all are? Yeah, you know we run this
Hopin' D.C, talkin' all that dumb shit
Rich man get out the way, wreckin' man pave the way
'Cause we ain't gonna sit around and get pushed down another day
And did I mention that we ain't gonna listen
To another two bit crooked ass politician?
Let's take our country back, I think I got the solution
It's the American Rebelution

[Verse 2: Brian "Rooster" King]
Get a beatbox in this king's practice, own up, 'bout to get beat
Hope you don't think you would just come fall
What you thinkin', Time McGraw
Boy, that 30 Ought got a big kick and them crosshairs don't mean shit
Don't take too much for no city slick in his skinny jeans and them weird kicks
Mind you, only leave us ‘lone, that's your best bet
Man, I don't think y'all wanna be messin' 'round with them rednecks
Pissed off them outlaws, don't play nice, don't mind laws
Sneak around and hunt ya down, y'all get it now? We stand tall
Hey, when the folks, don't like my style, I creep on by with a crooked smile
Take a big boy swig and a homemade shot and lose ya down that country mile
Rebel people, y'all don't mind what we doin', when you see us comin' through
The American Rebelution
