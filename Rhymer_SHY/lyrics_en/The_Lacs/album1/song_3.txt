She just wants to leave this bar and hit a back road
Slide close, girl you got just what I want
She hit the gas said baby, I don't wanna ride slow
Haul ass
It's me and you all weekend long
She just wants to leave this bar and hit a back road
Slide close, girl you got just what I want
She hit the gas said baby, I don't wanna ride slow
Haul ass
It's me and you all weekend long
Same old weekend
Nothin' to do but hang around this pub
Same old DJ, same old clich?
'bout then, she come walkin' up
Had them cut offs and them tan thighs
And that bud light and it's just right
Say, what you say about you and me
Jump in the truck, go ride the creek
So I didn't waste too much time
Called up pa, got a bottle of wine
Bout ten minutes to the county line
And there's nothing but dirt roads for miles and miles
I knew she couldn't hold back
She grabbed the CD from off the dash
Say, what you know about johnny cash
She popped it in sang every track
Devil's ridin' shotgun
Picked up my wrap and said
Let's burn it if you got one
Think I'm in love
We rode all night just drinkin', talkin'
Didn't really know when she had to be home
She said, keep rollin' I know where I'm goin'
Its gonna take all weekend long
She just wants to leave this bar and hit a back road
Slide close, girl you got just what I want
She hit the gas said baby, I don't wanna ride slow
Haul ass
It's me and you all weekend long
She just wants to leave this bar and hit a back road
Slide close, girl you got just what I want
She hit the gas said baby, I don't wanna ride slow
Haul ass
It's me and you all weekend long
Droppin' down that tailgate
Crankin' out that george straight
Georgia on them license plate
She ready, so why wait
Bowed legs and boots on
Got them daisy dukes on
And a baby blue thong
Wildin' out to tucson
Wanna hit that creek bank
Pretty little sweet thang
She could cause a heat wave
Flyin' down the breezeway
Goin' 75 down the dirt road ridin'
It don't matter as long as she beside me
Ridin' fast and we ridin' high
We hit the gas
And we fly on by
Drank tequila at sunrise
Talkin' over them fun times
Turnin' over them mud tires
Seein' how far the mud flies
Turnin' off them new phones
Turnin' up them old songs
Ridin' out 'till the beer is gone
Ain't goin' home all weekend long
She just wants to leave this bar and hit a back road
Slide close, girl you got just what I want
She hit the gas said baby, I don't wanna ride slow
Haul ass
It's me and you all weekend long
She just wants to leave this bar and hit a back road
Slide close, girl you got just what I want
She hit the gas said baby, I don't wanna ride slow
Haul ass
It's me and you all weekend long
Say she can't wait
Drop the tailgate
Hit the riverbank
(just me and you all weekend long)
Say she can't wait
Drop the tailgate
Hit the riverbank
(just me and you all weekend long)
She just wants to leave this bar and hit a back road
Slide close, girl you got just what I want
She hit the gas said baby, I don't wanna ride slow
Haul ass
It's me and you all weekend long
She just wants to leave this bar and hit a back road
Slide close, girl you got just what I want
She hit the gas said baby, I don't wanna ride slow
Haul ass
It's me and you all weekend long
She just wants to leave this bar and hit a back road
