[Verse 1]
Fuck a 9 to 5
Cause a 9 to 5 ain't me
Doin what I love to do
Is all that i need
Boy, I got my team
Tryna live stress free
Cause i remember them long nights
In my dorm room back in Kansas
With no money in my account
And no way home
But you wouldn't understand it
Cause I was working and lurking
And living life with a purpose
My momma telling me to get a job
Like is it worth it
I got to do a 9 to 5
That's an 8 hour shift
I rather work an 808
And just light the spliff
I rather do what I love to do
Even if what I love to do
Didn't pay cause there's much more to life
Then just going to school
And then working it off everyday
So I show my haters[???]
[???] but I'm gon' flex
Every chance that I get I spit devilish shit
That's that flame in my heart but there's no triple 6
But it is triple 6 minus 566
If you don't get with that, then you not on my list
[???] let's be honest most you niggas took an L
In a generous way
Now niggas wanna be like "Feed Me"
Coming with the games
I ghost like a  ouija
No disrespect to them niggas
They only show love when they need me
You don't know shit about adversity
Droppin off from universities
Just to do what you love
And I swear the devil keep cursing me
So fuck it

[Hook]x2
Fuck a 9 to 5
Fuck a 9 to 5
(Fuck That)
My Momma Telling me
To get off my behind
(Fuck That)
Fuck a 9 to 5
Fuck a 9 to 5
(Fuck That)
I'm gettin to the money
I can't fall behind

[Verse2]
No days off, I'm no Bueller
So I sit back and use my Medulla
My nigga stealing my style
I never did the same
Nor bit, why act like Rasputia?
See they get a little jealous
When you paving the way
While they work a 9 to 5
And making minimum wage
Why trip when I'm out
Doing shows in LA
Fuck that
I'm making more than you can make in day
So I'm Californicating
[???] like I was a Jamaican
I'm burning bread
Let's have a toast
This moment cause for a celebration
Tell Uncle Sam I'mma get it how can
Cause I do it for the love of it
And never do it for the man
Or the fame or the money
Or the praise
So at every single chance
Imma do it for the fans
Im the motherfucking man

[Verse 3]
Cause I been in the lab
Working like Dexter
Mom interrupt like DeeDee
Telling me I should let go
Asking Me "[???] are you still keeping hope"
Cause this rap shit
It remind me of a [???]
And the [???] remind me of an A&R
They want to bait you in
When your life not still
Then cut your drive off
Then they want to take charge
That's why I would never do a label
Cause when they cain they'll treat you like abel
So watch your back my brother
And never listen to others
And never ever let'em steal your joy
Even if it's your mother
Cause see my mother
Yeah she thought this shit was temporary
Until I started putting beats up in obituaries
So when I scream I'm the best
[???]
Just know that we the modern day Ben & Jerry's
MotherFuck them
