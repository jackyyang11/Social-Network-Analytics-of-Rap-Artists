[Intro]
Ronny J, listen up

[Hook] x2
Have you ever had sex with an angel?
Woke up, made love to a demon?
Fucked up, all night to the evening
Oh god, I love this feeling

[Verse 1: [?]]
Have you ever had a white girl
When an Asian took cocaine off your dick, boys was amazing
Hotel room, sit back and I'm blazin'
I swear I saw a stripper, that's an Asian persuasion
I might just fuck her and her friend at the same time
But it's like threesome, we trynna unwind
But yo, yo, relax, I got her wrapped around my fingers but it's no strings attached
And she gave me that monster head, tryna to take it full
God, I'm putting my balls in her mouth, look like that energy drink
Bottles, yeah she said you nasty
One thing that she wanna axe me
I know what you prefer, but is it Braddy or is it daddy?

[Hook] x2
Have you ever had sex with an angel?
Woke up, made love to a demon?
Fucked up, all night to the evening
Oh god, I love this feeling

[Verse 2: Pouya]
Abortion is the only option, baby
We gon' have to kill this fucking baby
Baby girl, you know you drive me crazy
I wanted to pull out, but it feels so good
I've thought about, never thought it would
Happen to me, cause I'm a rapper
I'm invincible, indestructable
But baby boys don't come with deductables
I gotta pay my rent
I can't have another motherfucker under my tent
CBF for the plan b
For which one, I don't know cause I ran three, not me
Not feeling so dandy
Please tell me that it's not my, he gon' be
25 when I'm 45
Baby swallow this pill and just let it die

[Hook] x2
Have you ever had sex with an angel?
Woke up, made love to a demon?
Fucked up, all night to the evening
Oh god, I love this feeling

[Verse 3: [?]]
Okay
I can't even lie boy
Lately, I've been fucking groupie hoes
Meet 'em out in public, then invite them to the studio
Hit it twice, now she start liking shit
Now she wanna post a nigga on IG
I've been through chick fans before, had a Twitter
Before we do shit, I need ID
Just to verify me on that sloppy toppy
While I'm under water, that's an aqua bobby
I'm under water like a seel
She's ready to swallow a niggas seed
She ready to suck my soul
Ready for reaching the goal
Little does she know, she gon' suck it and fuck it and go
That's what they get when ya dealing with a monster
It can get you everyday, but it's gon' cost ya
