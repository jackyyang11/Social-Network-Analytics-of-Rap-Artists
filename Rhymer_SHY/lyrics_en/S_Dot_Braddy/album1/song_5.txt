[Intro/Dialogue]
Crew members continue with this rescue, uh
Demonstration of the cipher unit disc- (scrambled)
Looks like you got an optic [?] if you look out there
I don't see these things

[Verse 1]
Gas suit and hopped out the mo'fuckin space ship
Man this shit is not fair, man
Cause a nigga blacked out
And I'm reaching elevations of a tuskegee air, man
Cruising with Johnnie Walker right beside me
I'm talking to the *bleep* that nigga just wanna sign me
He said he gone need my mind, body, and soul
If it don't involve power then I won't let it go
I just want the willpower, he just want my Hancock
Nigga I'm an asshole, he won't get my Hancock
But I let my hand cock back with a Mayweather
And right hooks that rain like Mayweather
From George, T.J., and Lincoln
Hamilton Jackon's what I'm thinkin'
Grand Benjamin Franklin could ride to
I kept it grand times two and I stayed true

[Interlude/Dialogue]
Developing now at 11
There's a bizarre situation in South Miami right now
Police are investigating multiple reports of a strange object falling out of the sky
The search was centered around the area of South-West 87th Street and Red Road
As for CBS 4's, Tiffany Hellbert, is live with the latest
Tiffany

[Verse 2]
My vision is half of Jay-Z's club
With a blueprint to the city, tryna spread love
But I have to pack to steal the shoe
When given the cue, I got the juice
Shit is real so now I'm talking to a bishop
I brought the snakes, the guns, the para-medics
Just know that I'm high, off the ca-nnabis and psy-chedelics
I dare a motherfucker in the room to just say shit
Highly possessed *bleep* with a face-lift
Sodium-chloride is what a nigga pay with
[?] better face it
Rap niggas swear that they fly, with no bars
Airplane mode, niggas know who they are
They ain't seen it like this since 1995
I'm the current Bernard Harris
I'm keeping hope alive
Motherfucker that's fly shit
Bitch I'm out of this world
Motherfucker that's fly shit
Bitch I'm out of this world
Motherfucker that's fly shit
Bitch I'm out of this world
Motherfucker that's fly shit
Bitch I'm out of this world
