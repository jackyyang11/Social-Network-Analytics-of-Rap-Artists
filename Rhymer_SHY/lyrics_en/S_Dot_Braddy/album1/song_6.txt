[Verse 1: SDotBraddy]
Look, Look
It's the black that's too white to be niggerish
Sipping black Henny my heart is darker than liquorice
"Oh my fucking God" did that just came out his nigga lips
"I'm Sorry" to my fans ya'll got to excuse my ignorance
She all over my woody since I caught a little buzz
That was such a light year and she loves what I does
Now she showing me her nudes, I'm trying to find where the pics are
As soon I saw, I plotted to kill the pussy I'm Jigsaw
I can see the critics now talking shit later
Comparing me to that Odd nigga Tyler The Creator
No disrespect to him, but if I'm Tyler The Creator
Ya'll can all suck my dick and swallow, Tell me hows the flavor
Disrespectful than a motherfucker, fuck you motherfuckers
I insist to bring that sick shit, like I'm my mothers fucker
Fuck you tremor rappers man I hate when ya'll around
Talking about you such a monster, then why you underground
You a lame ass nigga,no fans ass nigga
"Hey I just dropped a song" go and spam ass niggas
And to you fucking promoters, listen up to what I'm saying
Fucking With my Piccolo will have me turning into Saiyan
Or maybe Goku, dumb nigga that means loco
Throw they ass in the Trunk and just have them scream out they vocals
Helen Keller to labels, they can't see me cause I'm local
"Fuck It" They couldn't see me even if they had bifocals

[Hook 1: Taylor Simone]
Tell me whats good, tell me whats real
Ain't no use in keeping secrets baby, tell me how you feel
I know it hurts, Can't keep it in
Ain't no use in keeping secrets baby, tell me all of it

[Verse 2: SDotBraddy]
Uh, Look
I'd be lying if I said I loved my father
JK I'm rolling while watching Harry Potter
Excuse my drug abuse, but I never gave a fuck
So the abstinence to your virgin ears is out of luck
I inhale the April two zero to find serenity
And ate the pussy side ways hoping it last infinity
Missing three out of three to connect the dots to the trinity
Holy Spirit, The Sun, I hope my father is hearing me
And at age 14 I spit my first 16
I was trying to get my cake up , spitting sweet 16's
Don't let that ho tell you she like your sweet 16
She only in the room to get the millions: Christin
And these lines were meant from my mouth, I'm spitting listerine
Don't come with that trash, not here cause I'm mister clean
Cleaning up you trash rappers
Wrapping trash rappers up
And throw them in the trash
Cause they ass backwards
Watching your every little move, I'm the S.S.A
But on top only us and we no Ese's
But for that paper I will go essay
And body a beat with a intro, conclude as I say
"We the illest and a menace to society"
Better watch your back you know they all keep eyeing me and trying me
Trying to split us up but we Siamese
See I lay low like genetics of a Chinese

[Hook]
