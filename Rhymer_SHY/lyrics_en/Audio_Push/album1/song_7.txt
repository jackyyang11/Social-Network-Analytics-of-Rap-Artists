[Verse 1 : Price]
One time (One time)
One time (One time)
B-O-Dub
I really want her, but my man stuck on her
Baby bad put them hand cuffs on her
These niggas lying, but I'm giving her the truth
Both hands on her booty like I'm giving her a boost
She got her cakes back, with her face front
And she gon clown on you if you gotta lace front
And If it's hater in here tryna act all hardy
They gon get stomped out and drug out this party
Cause I'm here with my team, getting this green
Her booty on my lap, man I'm living the dream
We kick it fo sho, we making it snow
And if Cash DJ she gon shake it some mo
I said I must be in heaven, seven eleven
She shake it so hard I can see through her leggings
We up in this thang, and Bow is the gang
And if they ask who she is, I ain't sayin no names
Imma just tell em

[Hook: Price]
She a Bad Woa, A lil Bad Woa
She hear her song, hit the floor
And take it mad low
She a Bad Woa, A lil Bad Woa
She hear her song, hit the floor
And take it mad low
She a Bad Woa, A lil Bad Woa [x3]
She hear her song, hit the floor
And take it mad low

[Verse 2 : Oktane]
Alright, nine outta ten if she bad then I beat it
And you probably mean muggin looking sad and you heated
Yo girl a necessity, imma get it when I need it
And I treat her like fruit, if it's clean, imma eat it
I hit it once and knock that tummy out the park
She wanna kick it when I lick it, that's tongue martial arts
Legs up in the air, like an upside down stick up
If I call, two rings, bet a hundred that she pick up
She go to school, I'm trynna take her tonight
But she said she can't cause she gotta paper to write
Imma get her, imma take her, imma strech her, imma reach her
And she ain't gon care about her professor or her teacher
All these women here, and you hatin everyday
Rally with some haters, nigga you gay!
Yo team run they mouth, my team run the game
And I would say you fine, but girl I forgot your name
So I say

[Hook: Price]
She a Bad Woa, A lil Bad Woa
She hear her song, hit the floor
And take it mad low
She a Bad Woa, A lil Bad Woa
She hear her song, hit the floor
And take it mad low
She a Bad Woa, A lil Bad Woa [x3]
She hear her song, hit the floor
And take it mad low

[Verse 3 : Oktane]
You like it because it's dressed and got a weave on it
She make me love it, make me wanna put a ring on it
Because I love the way she walk in, I love the way she walk it out
Five chicks texting me and she the one I'm talking about
She don't ever get in my business, don't ever bug me
Clique full of chicks and ain't none of them ugly
She listen to Bow music and know all of the words
Said she brought the hair on her head she said its her's

[Verse 4 : Price]
And if it's her's then it's mine, cause what’s her's I own
The Bad Woas got ta tootin once they heard this song
Yo baby flexed up, looking clean on her bum
She a freak, you could see the ring on her tongue
She on the tip, lil mama never trip
Purse hangin off her wrist and her polish never chipped
She Party hard and ain't ever gotta sleep in
School during the week, but clubbing on the weekend
She know that

[Hook: Price]
She a Bad Woa, A lil Bad Woa
She hear her song, hit the floor
And take it mad low
She a Bad Woa, A lil Bad Woa
She hear her song, hit the floor
And take it mad low
She a Bad Woa, A lil Bad Woa [x3]
She hear her song, hit the floor
And take it mad low
