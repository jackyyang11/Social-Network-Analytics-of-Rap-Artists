[Intro: Price]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I always wanted to rap on this beat
A nigga love Forces
So shit, my turn, yeah

[Verse 1: Price]
I wake up, kiss my woman, shower, brush my teeth, hit the dro
Grab my G Nikes off the shelf and then I peace out the door
And you know I'm steppin', like to keep the crease at the toe
And Price don't ever fuck 'em up, I keep a toothbrush for the scuffle

[Verse 2: Oktane]
Yeah, gum bottoms for real, take me back to Nellyville
Them kids finna buy again, tell Nike give me the deal, yeah
Fresher than me? Try again and bring me somethin' real
Custom pair, ain't tried, yeah, wipe me down until

[Verse 3: Peice]
I spend $150, none less on them
If I ain't rockin' Vans, then you know I'm rockin' mid tops with the checks on 'em
You get choke slammed if you step on 'em
Might bring back the Burberry
Might bring back the Spurs jersey
Who all in it, got the black and red
'cause I ain't had to say it but I keep it on replay
Was in my momma room buggin' like every hour and every week day
For the paddlers out in East Bay
Got the good vibes with the gum bottoms
Custom made, don't no one got 'em
Wait I lied, my wife got em, Wait I lied, my son got em

[Hook]
Give me two pairs
('cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones
(I said) give me two pairs
('cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones

[Outro]
Give me two pairs
('cause) I need two pairs
Woah, oh shit, we live?
Ah, alright, fuck it, next one
