[Verse 1: Price]
Stop what ya doin', press pause, we might can share time
I got so much steeze that maybe we can share mine
Catch me up in the air I’m starin' with a nice dime
I’m in the clouds so now they call me Price Airlines
Now you can try to tell me who can hold these streets
Or name a better rapper that can hold these beats
I keep rasisin' the bar while your flow decrease

[Hook: Oktane]
Now lemme lemme lemme tell, hello to all of y’all
We flyin’ over here and you look so small
Girl i’m so fly i’m never gon’ fall
I’m busy or booked whenever these girls call
Yeah, all the girls they tryna ride with me
I got the G4 baby, you can glide with me
I’m above the clouds so come and fly with me
We can go high fill the sky with me
Hit me cause i’m fly
