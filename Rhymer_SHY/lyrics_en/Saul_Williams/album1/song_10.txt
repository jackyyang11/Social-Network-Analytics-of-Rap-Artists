I used to hump my pillow at night
The type of silent prayer to help myself prepare for the light
Me and my cousin Duce would rank the girls between one and ten
And the highest number got to be my pillow's pretend
Now I apologize to every high ranker
But you taught me how to dream and so I also thank you
I never had the courage to approach you at school
We joked around a lot and I know you thought I dressed cool
But I was just covering up, all the insecurities that came bubbling up
My complexion had me stuck in an emotional rut
Like the time you Flavor Flaved me and you played me "Yo Chuck"
They say "You're too black man", I think I'm too black
Mom, do you think I'm too black?, I think I'm too black
I think I'm too black, I think I'm too black
You're black, you're black, you're black, you're black

[Hook: Saul Williams]
Black Stacey, they called me Black Stacey
I never got to be myself, cause to myself I always was
Black Stacey, in polka dots and paisley
A double goose and bally shoes, you thought it wouldn't faze me
I was Black Stacey, the preacher's son from Haiti
Who rhymed a lot and always got the dances at the party
I was Black Stacey, you thought it wouldn't faze me
But it did, cause I was just a kid

[Saul Williams]
I used to use bleaching creme
Til Madam C.J. Walker walked into my dreams
I dreamt of being white and complimented by you
But the only shiny black thing that you liked was my shoes
Now, I apologize for bottling up
All the little things you said that warped my head and my gut
Even though I always told you not to
Brag about the fact that your great grand
Mother was raped by her slave master
Yeah, I became militant too
So it was clear on every level I was blacker than you
I turned you on to Malcolm X and Assata Shakur
In my three quarter elephant goose with the fur
Had the high top fade with the steps on the side
Had the two finger ring, rag top on the ride
Had the sheep skin, name belt, Lee suit, Kangol
Acid wash Vasco, chicken and waffle

[Hook: Saul Williams]
Black Stacey, they called me Black Stacey
I never got to be myself, cause to myself I always was
Black Stacey, in polka dots and paisley
A double goose and bally shoes, you thought it wouldn't faze me
I was Black Stacey, the preacher's son from Haiti
Who rhymed a lot and always got the dances at the party
I was Black Stacey, you thought it wouldn't faze me
But it did, cause I was just a kid

[Saul Williams]
Hold up y'all, here we go
Now here's a little message for you
All you baller playa's got some insecurities too
That you could cover up, bling it up, cash in and cha-ching it up
Hope no one will bring it up, lock it down and string it up
Or you can share your essence with us
Cause everything about you couldn't be rugged and ruff
And even though you tote a Glock and you're hot on the street
If you dare to share your heart, we'll nod our head to its beat
And you should do that, if nothing else, to prove that
A player like you could keep it honest and true
Don't mean to call your bluff, but motherfucker that's what I do
You got platinum chain then, son, I'm probably talking to you
And you can call your gang, your posse and the rest of your crew
And while you're at it, get them addicts and the indigent too
I plan to have a whole army by the time that I'm through
To load their guns with songs they haven't sung, like

Black Stacey, they called me Black Stacey

Black Stacey, they called me Black Stacey
I never got to be myself, cause to myself I always was
Black Stacey, they call me Black Stacy
I'm Black Stacey, oooooh, Black Stacy!
Move Black Stacy
Groove Black Stacy! Shake Black Stacy!
Make, Black Stacy, cry! Cry!
No, not I
They say I'm too black
They say I'm too black
Brrrr stick up, ha-ha-ha, stick up
Brrrr stick up, ha-ha-ha, stick up
