[Refrain: Saul Williams]
Fuck you understand me
Fuck you understand me
Fuck you understand me
I said fuck you understand me
Fuck you understand me
Fuck you understand me
Fuck you understand me
I said fuck you understand me
(repeat)

[Verse 1: Saul Williams]
Ay raise up
Ignorant motherfucker get your game up
Who out there running things? Who out there running things?
First nation sweat ceremony in a space ship
Nigga get out of here, unanimous goldmine
What happened to peace?
All Coltrane solos at once
Race is performative, asked Maya to translate Joplin
She said Scott or Janice
To be honest I was used to the shackles
Religious upbringing, patriarchal manchild in the promised land
My identity was encrusted with the myth of having been chosen
Stopped and frisked Monday morning
Got schooled before I even arrived there
Teacher want to know why I'm late
Criminal justice and the pipeline...
Get yours cause I got mine
Get yours! Get yours!
Virtual freedom, avatar dust and the mockingbird

Fuck you understand me
Fuck you understand me
Fuck you understand me
Fuck you understand me
Fuck you understand me
I said fuck you understand me

[Bridge: Haleek Maul]
Your feeling
Coming through the ceiling
Never let the light in, you heard it gives you cancer
Never had an answer for anything in your life
If you think you do then you better think twice
Everything is trife, everything is fright
Knife, through him if he don't look at you right, like flex

[Verse 2: Saul Williams]
All Coltrane solos at once

Twist them horns 'round the necks of each equation and expand upon multiples of death
We were crowded in the shitbins of a floating toilet
Dreaming of an afterlife
Memory stored in a cloud, terrabytes in sea major
The winners of religious thinking praise books for bookends
Here is the invention of the astronaught
First Nation sweat ceremony in a spaceship
To imagine Hell is privilege
Paint a dreamworld solid enough to hold us
Held by blocks of time, margins and calendars, divisions of labour, contracts social and otherwise
With each kiss biodynamic in direct co-relation to stars and seasons
The ability to calculate distance, harness power, stem cells, erect mobile mansions capable of projecting destruction at greater and greater will
What could be keeping us here?
Here is what death is like, life without fear

[Refrain: Saul Williams]
Fuck you understand me
Fuck you understand me
Fuck you understand me
I said fuck you understand me
Fuck you understand me
Fuck you understand me
Fuck you understand me
I said fuck you understand me
(repeat)
