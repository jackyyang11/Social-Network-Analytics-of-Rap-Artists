Downtown, on the block, at the club
Steaming hot, dancing, talking shit, telling lies
Like a pimp, meanwhile, underpaid
Read like, second grade
Uncle Sam, sign you up
Benefits, and a gun
Now tell me, where my niggas at?
Now tell me, where my niggas at?
Now tell me, where my niggas at?
Now tell me, where my niggas at?
African people, African people, African people, African people
Shotgun, shotgun, shotgun, shotgun
Rise up, over-stand
Stand your ground
Own your land
Serve all, love all, never sleep
Never fall, meditate
Eat right, pray first
Then fight, but for truth, not for fame
Not for glory, or the game
Now tell me, where my niggas at?
Now tell me, where my niggas at?
Now tell me, where my niggas at?
Now tell me, where my niggas at?
