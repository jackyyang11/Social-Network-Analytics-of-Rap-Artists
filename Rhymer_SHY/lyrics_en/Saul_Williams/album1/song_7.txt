Dancing on the corpses' ashes, the corpses' ashes (x3)

Dancing on the corpses' ashes
Dancing on the corpses' ashes

Gone from all the corpses' ashes

Here comes Lazarus
Triangulating green
God, dear Pythagoras
Equal to the sum of what the matter is
What the matter is
What the matter is
What the matter is

What's the matter?
Some politicians' pockets getting fatter
The Robert Moses of the useless chatter
Ignores the data
Ignores the data
Ignores the data

But it keeps building
The wall between the poor and the rich building
Headquarters for the police worth a billion
They make a killing
They make a killing
Protect and serve
Your bullets won't deliver the last word
Police of the religions as absurd
(Fuck the word)
Heed the feeling
The calculating masses are appealing
The jury hung from every museum ceiling

Dancing on the corpses' ashes (repeating in background)

History
Tries it's best
To keep us kneeling
We have come
Standing in the field of bankers dung
Extinguishing the fires of the young
Who should have listened when the sirens rung
Cause we found them
Dancing on the ones who have renowned them
And they couldn't give a fuck
