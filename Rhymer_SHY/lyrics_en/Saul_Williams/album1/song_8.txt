[Saul Williams]
We are broken... instruments
Burst wide open...smashed and bent
Not what you'd expect from these city streets
Who serves to protect the orchestra in me?
Conductor! Conductor!...I feel electricity
Conductor! Conductor! Can you bring out the song in me?

Instruments, instruments, instruments (banged and blown through)
Instruments, instruments, instruments (banged and blown through)
Instruments, instruments, instruments (banged and blown through)
Instruments, instruments, instruments, instruments

We are broken... instruments
Burst wide open...smashed and bent
Not what you'd expect from these city streets

Instruments, instruments, instruments (banged and blown through)
Instruments, instruments, instruments (banged and blown through)
Instruments, instruments, instruments (banged and blown through)
Instruments, instruments, instruments, instruments

[Saul Williams]
Conductor! Conductor!
...Conductor! Conductor!
Can you bring out the song in me?
