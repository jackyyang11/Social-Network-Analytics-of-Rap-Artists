[Chorus: Yung Mal]
Big house with the lake, hit the booth, one take
Beat the trap, earthquake, good lawyer, beat the case
Me and Pablo in the Wraith, we got bands, extra cake
Hit the gas, meditate, we done came a long way
Now we got racks the long way
We send them packs the long way
These niggas broke and they gay
But we get paid, 1017 ways
Now we got racks the long way
We send them packs the long way
These niggas broke and they gay
But we get paid, 1017 ways

[Verse 1: HoodRich Pablo Juan]
I'm from the gutter, everybody robin hoods
Whey I pull up it's called the GOAT bus
Got bitches sellin' pussy to the trap
We got bread for the beef like the Fudruckers
Me and 1'5, we the mud brothers
I fuck on your baby mama, I'm a motherfucker
That nigga funny, call him Chris Tucker
I know how to shoot, I don't need no must
I'm on the sip when I go to the sip
Gun on my hip, I'm bustin' out the rip
She ain't wanna suck the dick, I dip
Blue hundreds in my pocket
Water drippin', nigga mop it
You ain't rich, nigga stop it
Bought a new freezer with the profit
I'm the original, you a copy
I need a bitch with a natural body
Me and Lil Jay Brown ridin' in the Masi
We stackin' the money up then divide it
Smoking gelato, you never tried it
Drippin' the ice, I'm gliding
My money so long, gotta count by the mileage
Got a palace, still got to the palace
She wanna fuck now but I'm childish

[Chorus: Yung Mal]
Big house with the lake, hit the booth, one take
Beat the trap, earthquake, good lawyer, beat the case
Me and Pablo in the Wraith, we got bands, extra cake
Hit the gas, meditate, we done came a long way
Now we got racks the long way
We send them packs the long way
These niggas broke and they gay
But we get paid, 1017 ways
Now we got racks the long way
We send them packs the long way
These niggas broke and they gay
But we get paid, 1017 ways

[Verse 2: Lil Jay Brown]
Real street youngin, money hungry, itchin' for a big lick
I just got my fuckin' soul snatched by a thick bitch
I see your baby mama fell in love with the wrist
Wrecked the Masi swervin' just like a ripstick
Get in the trap and I flip shit
She sucking my dick and she leavin' her lipstick
Woah, 1017, strapped the fuck up, what the fuck do you mean?
The Louis Vuitton, I mix it with Supreme
Ten bands in these Balmain jeans
Money Power Respect, you know I need all of that
I fucked your bitch yesterday but won't call back
You want some problems, you know we can solve that
Tryna stand up against us, you gon' fall flat
Ayy, thirty clip, fifty round, hundred round
Nigga you know we got all that
Yeah, ex bitch see a young nigga makin' moves
Now she really wanna crawl back
Plus your big sister just told me she fuck with my music
So I'm tryna get where her jaws at
Get where her walls at
Yeah, and I won't call back

[Chorus: Yung Mal]
Big house with the lake, hit the booth, one take
Beat the trap, earthquake, good lawyer, beat the case
Me and Pablo in the Wraith, we got bands, extra cake
Hit the gas, meditate, we done came a long way
Now we got racks the long way
We send them packs the long way
These niggas broke and they gay
But we get paid, 1017 ways
Now we got racks the long way
We send them packs the long way
These niggas broke and they gay
But we get paid, 1017 ways
