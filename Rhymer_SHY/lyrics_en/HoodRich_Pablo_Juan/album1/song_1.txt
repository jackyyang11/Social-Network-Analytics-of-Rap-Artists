[Chorus: DC White]
She's my number one fan
Little mama always sold the bands
She's my number one fan
Took a trip to the island just to tan
She's my number one fan
She's my number one fan
She's my number one fan
She's my number one fan

[Verse 1: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Trapping by Birkin, jugging at Buscemi's
[?] Louis V seaweed
She kept the skurt from me, I bought red bottoms
She just wanna fuck something, she don't want nothing, no problem
She's my number one fan, I'm her number one fan
All she wanna hit me up from the airport when I land
She say she tired of her buster and she got a man
Givenchy thumbs, [?] toes in the sand

[Chorus: DC White]
She's my number one fan
Little mama always sold the bands
She's my number one fan
Took a trip to the island just to tan
She's my number one fan
She's my number one fan
She's my number one fan
She's my number one fan

[Verse 2: DC White]
Shawty's pussy so good, I bought a Range Rover
And she told me, "Tell them bitches that the game over"
She always in the kitchen, throwing away my baking soda
Took her on a trip, let my partner take my orders
Yeah, she's my number one fan
Mama stayed down and we shopping out of France
I love the way she dance
[?] bitch left her man

[Chorus: DC White]
She's my number one fan
Little mama always sold the bands
She's my number one fan
Took a trip to the island just to tan
She's my number one fan
She's my number one fan
She's my number one fan
She's my number one fan
