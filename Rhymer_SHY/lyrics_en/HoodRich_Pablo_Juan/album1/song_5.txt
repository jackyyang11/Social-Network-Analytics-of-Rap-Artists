[Chorus]
Two bitches in a jacuzzi like I'm Uzi
I got the chopsticks, drinking the raw like it's sushi
"One call, that's all" like I'm Ken Nugent
My young niggas pull up they roof and they shoot
I switch up my fit like I dress out in movies
Fire up the cookie, the air get polluted
Captain Planet ring, I'm fucking the groupies
Ice on me, got me feeling the coolest
Nigga, I'm good anywhere
Pull up in your hood with brick fair
Oooh, bitch, I'm Ric Flair
I'm whipping the chicken, got babies like daycare
Trap out the house, you know we don't stay there
Hundred round drum, you know we don't play fair
Pound for pound, undefeated like Mayweather
I fucked that hoe, I ain't know that y'all stay together

[Verse 1]
Rollie DayDay, I pulled out the belt
I double on dates, I fuck without [?]
I heard you a rat, you eating the cheddar
I'm still trapping, get a bag of [?]
Eighteen karat, iced out the gold metal
My young niggas ready to shoot, they don't know better
Niggas be faking, they hating, they snakes
I'm Gucci, I'm a double G: go-getter
All you pussy and hoe niggas
Bad bitch ride the dick like a four-wheeler
Chopper on me, nigga, I ain't scared of no nigga
Pots out the whip on the stove with it
Nigga, you broke, you better get fixing
Five different plugs, you know I'm consistent
Big ahk with the blood on the Christians
I walk there with two bitches dripping like I just got [?]

[Chorus]
Two bitches in a jacuzzi like I'm Uzi
I got the chopsticks, drinking the raw like it's sushi
"One call, that's all" like I'm Ken Nugent
My young niggas pull up they roof and they shoot
I switch up my fit like I dress out in movies
Fire up the cookie, the air get polluted
Captain Planet ring, I'm fucking the groupies
Ice on me, got me feeling the coolest
Nigga, I'm good anywhere
Pull up in your hood with brick fair
Oooh, bitch, I'm Ric Flair
I'm whipping the chicken, got babies like daycare
Trap out the house, you know we don't stay there
Hundred round drum, you know we don't play fair
Pound for pound, undefeated like Mayweather
I fucked that hoe, I ain't know that y'all stay together

[Verse 2]
Undefeated like I'm Mayweather
80 pointers in a rollie, trying to break the bezel
I blocked the little bitch, she trying to send a letter
I'm an ex-robber and a dope seller
Strapped up everywhere with heavy metal
I fucked that bitch right on your dresser
Don't give no fuck, why you trying to impress her?
In the lab, making work on the compressor
[?] but the diamonds in [?]
I trap out the tree, then I wrap them in [?]
So bitch, you better get your shit together
All these diamonds on me, I'm applying pressure
Hood, they label me rich or better
Pimp like a nigga with a hat and feather
Hot like a stove, water like a tea kettle
Still shipping out, nigga, like I don't know better

[Chorus]
Two bitches in a jacuzzi like I'm Uzi
I got the chopsticks, drinking the raw like it's sushi
"One call, that's all" like I'm Ken Nugent
My young niggas pull up they roof and they shoot
I switch up my fit like I dress out in movies
Fire up the cookie, the air get polluted
Captain Planet ring, I'm fucking the groupies
Ice on me, got me feeling the coolest
Nigga, I'm good anywhere
Pull up in your hood with brick fair
Oooh, bitch, I'm Ric Flair
I'm whipping the chicken, got babies like daycare
Trap out the house, you know we don't stay there
Hundred round drum, you know we don't play fair
Pound for pound, undefeated like Mayweather
I fucked that hoe, I ain't know that y'all stay together
