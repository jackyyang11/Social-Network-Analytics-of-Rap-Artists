[Chorus]
Rollie eighteen karat gold like my Cartiers
Got a whip, I got a chain, I guess I'm still a slave
Drinking lean, I got addicted, now I'm pouring drank
I can't never stop grinding, that's just how I'm made
I got two bitches trading places
Bossed up, got a team full of aces
Yeah, I'm the one beating they faces
Can't fuck with that ho if she basic
Last real nigga left in the matrix
Off-White shoes, Maison my laces
Ice all on my neck like a glacier
She got some fat lips, Fantasia

[Verse 1]
Don't fuck with these niggas, they cowards
Can't fuck with these bitches, they corny
I'm smelling like baby powder
I'm fucking that bitch in the morning, yeah
I fucked that bitch for an hour
She sucking it good, performing
I'm stacking that money tall like the towers
Shittin' on niggas, hope you knowing
How you let a trap nigga start hating
I drink the pint, I don't measure what I'm pouring
She was basic, left her name on the board
I'm high and I'm fly, a young nigga soaring
V-Lone how I'm looking at orange
Got a real freak bitch out a foreign
Bought a Porsche, call it Mike Larry
Bought an Audi, call it Martin Lawrence
Hoes chasing me like I got a warrant
Fuck your hundred round form
Bossed up, nigga watch how I'm doin'
Shootin' at these niggas, I'm making a movie
Most of these niggas acting like some groupies
Most of these bitches nothin' but some coochie
I got a need for speed, feeling couped up
Fuck these hoes, I be duck duck goosing

[Chorus]
Rollie eighteen karat gold like my Cartiers
Got a whip, I got a chain, I guess I'm still a slave
Drinking lean, I got addicted, now I'm pouring drank
I can't never stop grinding, that's just how I'm made
I got two bitches trading places
Bossed up, got a team full of aces
Yeah, I'm the one beating they faces
Can't fuck with that ho if she basic
Last real nigga left in the matrix
Off-White shoes, Maison my laces
Ice all on my neck like a glacier
She got some fat lips, Fantasia

[Verse 2]
I'm selling that off white, treating the trap like the Price is Right
Flooded my Rollie with ice
From the junkies smoking dope out the pipe
I get money wrong, I know I ain't right
A nigga try me, I'ma send him to Christ
I'm living my life like I'm rolling the dice
Money got me fucking hoes the same night
Them niggas get cheese but they some mice
Pop a percocet, I do it twice
Sparklers on the Fanta, lean on the ice
You ain't a nigga pussy, that's a dyke
Fuck nigga pull up, it look like a stripe
I want the money power respect all of my life
Fuck it, I'm shooting on sight
Both thumbs up like I hitchhike
They eat it up, got a big bite
I turn to HoodWolf in the midnight
Started fuckin' her, her ass so fat that I just can't fit right
Money the only thing that I like
Money the only thing feel right
Deuce of Actavis in twenty ounce Sprite
These diamonds hit hard like they fight

[Chorus]
Rollie eighteen karat gold like my Cartiers
Got a whip, I got a chain, I guess I'm still a slave
Drinking lean, I got addicted, now I'm pouring drank
I can't never stop grinding, that's just how I'm made
I got two bitches trading places
Bossed up, got a team full of aces
Yeah, I'm the one beating they faces
Can't fuck with that ho if she basic
Last real nigga left in the matrix
Off-White shoes, Maison my laces
Ice all on my neck like a glacier
She got some fat lips, Fantasia
