[Chorus]
I got the plug in St. Tropez
Don't ask what I pay, I get it off in one day
Only one way?
Who told these niggas there was only one way?
I play with piano keys like I'm Ray
Ain't talking school, but I just passed the essay
I bust down the bricks, I'm the sensei
I just got fifty keys of that grey

[Verse 1]
Put fifty keys on the Greyhound
Junkies dancing like they James Brown
My Detroit nigga from the 8 Mile
(They on the way, they need ten pounds)
Young nigga from the streets, stayed down
Fuck I need a nigga for? I got a hundred rounds
Me and Sosamann sauce through the H-Town
Juug fifty keys on the PayPal
Another fifty pulling up right now
Push it, salt and pepper, white and brown
Dirty Sunkist done fucked up my mind
Fuck it, went and bought another fifty rounds
Twelve trying to buy the work through the grapevine
That nigga ran up, it's a man down
Come get your bitch, she all in mine
Wanna know how I got bales and don't make a sound

[Chorus]
I got the plug in St. Tropez
Don't ask what I pay, I get it off in one day
Only one way?
Who told these niggas there was only one way?
I play with piano keys like I'm Ray
Ain't talking school, but I just passed the essay
I bust down the bricks, I'm the sensei
I just got fifty keys of that grey

[Verse 2]
Smoking that cookie straight from the Bay
I need it, andale, comprende?
Country nigga, buy it all at one place
I might go buy it all at the mall today
Traffic coming down the one way, the wrong way
Dropping my ticket, it fall on a summer day
Let the little nigga live, it's your lucky day
I got work, but I ain't never worked one day
I got UPS, FedEx, and AAA
These niggas know I'm real, wanna imitate
Bitch, I'm the plug, ain't signing for no package or no deal
Nigga, what the fuck you make?
Do what you do in a month on my bad days
Your bitch with the plug, you got the sad face
Pussy nigga snitching, running the rat race
Run up on you, catch you slipping, how does that taste?

[Chorus]
I got the plug in St. Tropez
Don't ask what I pay, I get it off in one day
Only one way?
Who told these niggas there was only one way?
I play with piano keys like I'm Ray
Ain't talking school, but I just passed the essay
I bust down the bricks, I'm the sensei
I just got fifty keys of that grey
I got the plug in St. Tropez
Don't ask what I pay, I get it off in one day
Only one way?
Who told these niggas there was only one way?
I play with piano keys like I'm Ray
Ain't talking school, but I just passed the essay
I bust down the bricks, I'm the sensei
I just got fifty keys of that grey
