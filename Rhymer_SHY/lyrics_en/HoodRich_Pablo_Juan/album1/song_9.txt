[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Two bitches, five bitches, ten bitches, need all the bitches
Twenty bitches, fifty bitches, hundred bitches, need all the bitches
White bitches, black bitches, mixed bitches, need all the bitches
My bitches, your bitches, his bitches, need all the bitches
I want all the bitches, yeah, nigga, I want all the bitches
I want all the bitches, yeah, nigga, I want all the bitches
I want all the bitches, his bitch, your bitch
My bitches, want all the bitches
Mixed bitches, want all the bitches

[Verse 1: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
I want all the bitches
I want that hoodrat and that thot
I need me a bitch with that straight drop
Need me a bitch to put it in a headlock
I need me a mixed bitch with long hair
Riding with me when I chop off the top
I need me a bitch with a real and a fake ass
Long as she having that slop
I need me a bitch to work the crockpot
Hit up my main bitch and bond out
Got a bitch from the gump, let me find out
My Houston bitch let me fuck in her mouth
Got a white girl give me my style
I got all the bitches, fuck you talking 'bout?
My bitches say, "Fuck you talking 'bout?"
They know you can't live without

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Two bitches, five bitches, ten bitches, need all the bitches
Twenty bitches, fifty bitches, hundred bitches, need all the bitches
White bitches, black bitches, mixed bitches, need all the bitches
My bitches, your bitches, his bitches, need all the bitches
I want all the bitches, yeah, nigga, I want all the bitches
I want all the bitches, yeah, nigga, I want all the bitches
I want all the bitches, his bitch, your bitch
My bitches, want all the bitches
Mixed bitches, want all the bitches

[Verse 2: Diego Dose]
"Who ain't got no bitches?" Like I'm Welvin
I need a bitch with that Aquafina
Let me drill her in the back of the Bimmer
Got her own, bring money with you
Pablo got a bitch he can't live without
I got a bitch I can't forget about
Fucked her in her baby daddy's house
They all love the secret, don't run your mouth
Turned my sidechick's crib to a trap spot
Go there to bust the blocks
My Cuban bitch know how to smuggle it
My westside hoe know how to juggle it
Diego fresher than the Doublemint Twins
I need two on to cuddle with
Asian hoe speak with a accent
My police bitch call me by my government
Diego

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Two bitches, five bitches, ten bitches, need all the bitches
Twenty bitches, fifty bitches, hundred bitches, need all the bitches
White bitches, black bitches, mixed bitches, need all the bitches
My bitches, your bitches, his bitches, need all the bitches
I want all the bitches, yeah, nigga, I want all the bitches
I want all the bitches, yeah, nigga, I want all the bitches
I want all the bitches, his bitch, your bitch
My bitches, want all the bitches
Mixed bitches, want all the bitches
