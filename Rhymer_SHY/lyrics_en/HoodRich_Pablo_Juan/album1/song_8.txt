[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
All you gotta do is tell me what you want, place your order
No Aunt Jemima, cooking pancakes, just add water
My 'migo meet me halfway, that's somewhere by the border
I pull up in that Audi with them packs, transporter
Bags and the gas worth a whole quarter
Ten bricks on me worth a whole quarter
See this jewelry on me? Worth a whole quarter
That foreign on them Forges, worth a whole quarter, nigga

[Verse 1: MPA Spud]
Wheel across the border, I had to get my order
Pull up in that Jag, sipping on oil
Bricks everywhere, nigga, I'm a hoarder
The skillet and the pot got me spoiled
The Frank on my wrist cost me a quarter
Hitting every brick, trying to meet my quota
Got that boy throwing up in the foil
Solicit them bricks, standing in front of the border

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
All you gotta do is tell me what you want, place your order
No Aunt Jemima, cooking pancakes, just add water
My 'migo meet me halfway, that's somewhere by the border
I pull up in that Audi with them packs, transporter
Bags and the gas worth a whole quarter
Ten bricks on me worth a whole quarter
See this jewelry on me? Worth a whole quarter
That foreign on them Forges, worth a whole quarter, nigga

[Verse 2: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Left wrist worth a quarter, right wrist worth a quarter
Whipping up the dope so hard, my Rollie dropping 40-pointers
I'm up early in the morning, cooking bricks with Tom Joyner
Reggie Miller out of town, I'm shooting three-pointers
Bags in the mansion came from trapping on the corners
I put another separate stash up just for my lawyers
I had to put together my blood just for one order
Mix it like I'm DJ Spinz, turn the four into a clip

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
All you gotta do is tell me what you want, place your order
No Aunt Jemima, cooking pancakes, just add water
My 'migo meet me halfway, that's somewhere by the border
I pull up in that Audi with them packs, transporter
Bags and the gas worth a whole quarter
Ten bricks on me worth a whole quarter
See this jewelry on me? Worth a whole quarter
That foreign on them Forges, worth a whole quarter, nigga
