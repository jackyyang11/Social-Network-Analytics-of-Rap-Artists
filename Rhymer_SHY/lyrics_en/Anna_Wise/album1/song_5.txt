[Verse 1]
Met a lover on the sea
Said “you’ll miss me”
In another galaxy
Hid me in soul
She saw men
Oh torment
In and out of silent shapes
Soul mate

[Chorus]
Comes up and I know it comes in
Comes up and I know it comes

[Verse 2]
I was going the other way
Til I saw you
Painting on your fingernails
I remember how
It felt to be yours
Til I came into my own

[Chorus]
Comes up and I know it comes in
Comes up and I know it comes in
Comes up and I know it comes in

[Outro]
Keep it up, keep it up, up
Keep it up
Keep it up, keep it up, up
Keep it up
Keep it up, keep it up, up
Keep it up

Keep it up, keep it up, up
Keep it up
Keep it up, keep it up, up
Keep it up
Keep it up, keep it up, up
Keep it up

Keep it up, keep it up, up
Keep it up
Keep it up, keep it up, up
Keep it up
Keep it up, keep it up, up
Keep it up
