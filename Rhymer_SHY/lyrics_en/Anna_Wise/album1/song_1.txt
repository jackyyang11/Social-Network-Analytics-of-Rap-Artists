[Verse 1]
Here we are standing
In the earth light
At any given minute we could die
But all the same, it’s beautiful and bright, the light
We love laughing at purpose in the darkness
We are laughing at the darkness

[Chorus]
Never shine without casting a shadow
So there is balance in all

[Verse 2]
If you look closer (Smell the sun on your skin)
Don’t listen to what’s important (We have no use for that)
Run beside wild things throw away your gold
The mountainside is where the truth unfolds

[Bridge]
Going through our collective bodies
Right out of your open mouth
Straight into my eager ears
Shining from both our eyes
Tingling behind your knee caps
Slithering inside your spine
Beaming out in all directions
This is the game for life

[Chorus]
Never shine without casting a shadow
So there is balance in all
