[Verse 1]
I spot a breakup
I spot a make-up
And then I hit my vapor
Tryna get this paper
The world is turning
And ooh! My eyes are burning
I see all that I'm learning
But what about my earnings?

[Chorus]
Decrease my waist, increase my wage
Decrease my waist, increase my wage

[Refrain]
Is all ya sayin', all ya sayin'
All ya sayin' to me
Is all ya sayin', all ya sayin'
All ya sayin' to me
Is

[Verse 2]
I'm with my girlfriends
And they got girlfriends
You like to talk about us
But you don't ever speak to us
I'll tell ya straight up
We're all a little messed up
I see you filling yours up
So put a little in my cup

[Chorus]
Decrease my waist, increase my wage
Decrease my waist, increase my wage
Decrease my waist, increase my wage
Decrease my waist, increase my wage

[Refrain]
Is all ya sayin', all ya sayin'
All ya sayin' to me
Is all ya sayin', all ya sayin'
All ya sayin' to me
Is

[Chorus]
Decrease my waist, increase my wage
Decrease my waist, increase my wage
Decrease my waist, increase my wage
Decrease my waist, increase my wage

[Refrain]
Is all ya sayin', all ya sayin'
All ya sayin' to me
Is all ya sayin', all ya sayin'
All ya sayin' to me

[Bridge]
Everybody talkin' 'bout a new generation
Everybody talkin' like they the one
Why can't we all grow together?
Why can't we all be as one?

[Verse 3]
Separatin', lady-hatin', coughin' up for education
Stiflin' imagination, side eye to our liberation
Heavy hitters sellin' sex, hungry for who's comin' next
We still here, did you forget?
We still here, did you forget?

[Chorus]
Decrease my waist, increase my wage
Decrease my waist, increase my wage
Decrease my waist, increase my wage
Decrease my waist, increase my wage

[Refrain]
Is all ya sayin', all ya sayin'
All ya sayin' to me
Is all ya sayin', all ya sayin'
All ya sayin' to me

[Outro]
They try to break us up
They try to break us up
Try to break us up
Try to break us up
They try to break us up
They try to break us up
Try to break us up
Try to break us up
They try to break us up
They try to break us up
Try to break us up
Try to break us up
