It's a matter of opinion
When it comes to what you're thinking of me
Everything is beautiful and ugly
At the same time it's all how you see

I can feel the distance
Growing between what you're told and what you're thinking
All the governors of status
Quo know that they're old that ship is sinking
Go for it you know when we're together
Baby there's nothing that we can't do
So ignore their disapproval
Let's go for the free and novel me and you
