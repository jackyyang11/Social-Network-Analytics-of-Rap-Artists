[Intro]
Petals fall
Petals fall

[Chorus 1: Anna Wise]
Petals fall
Easy when I'm with you now
Such a chaotic start
But I'm hopeful for the future now
And I thank the universe for this gift
You and me
You've got me

[Post-Chorus]
Petals fall
Petals fall
Petals fall

[Verse 1: Xavier Omar]
Trouble calls easy when I'm with you now
There's danger in your smile
There's pleasure in right now
Now do we make this better
Will we ever?
Don't wanna leave, baby never, no
I need you in my arms
Don't make me wish it
Can't you see that you've got me?

[Verse 2: Anna Wise, Xavier Omar]
Petals fall
Easy when I'm with you now
(When I'm with you now)
Such a chaotic start
But I'm hopeful for the future now
(Hopeful for the future now)
And I thank the universe for this gift
(And I thank the universe for this gift)
You and me
You've got me

[Outro]
Petals fall
Petals fall
Petals fall
