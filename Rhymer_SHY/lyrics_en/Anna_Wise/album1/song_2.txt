[Verse 1]
So they're calling you a bitch, calling you a slut
Cause you dressed up, cause you dressed down
Cause you said no, cause you slept 'round
Cause you played games, cause you lost your head
Cause you went slow, cause you jumped ahead
Cause your hair's long, cause you shaved it off
Cause you did wrong, can't erase it, tough

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Cause beauty is fleeting, all an opinion
Cause you felt pretty when you attracted your minions
Cause people are seeing what they wanna see
The mirror of reflections to see who's to beat
But it's all a deflection

[Chorus]
I, I know what kind you are
If I say no, I'm a bitch
Say yes I'm a slut
I, I know what kind you are
If I say no, I'm a bitch
Say yes I'm a slut, say yes I'm a slut
I, I know what kind you are
If I say no, I'm a bitch
Say yes I'm a slut
I, I know what kind you are
If I say no, I'm a bitch
Say yes I'm a slut, say yes I'm a slut

[Verse 2]
I'm walking down the street with my hands tied
Cause I wore a skirt, you think I'm down to ride
You think I wanna fuck cause I comb my hair
Cause I'm at the bar next to an open chair
Cause I always have to be polite
Cause I look you in the eye
Cause I grin back, green light
Go ahead, give it a try

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I know there are people who like the attention
I know admiration is a kind of affection
But I'm more into the heart of a person
The day I follow fleeting is the day I'll be hurting
Yes, I'm into attention

[Chorus]
I, I know what kind you are
If I say no, I'm a bitch
Say yes I'm a slut
I, I know what kind you are
If I say no, I'm a bitch
Say yes I'm a slut, say yes I'm a slut
I, I know what kind you are
If I say no, I'm a bitch
Say yes I'm a slut
I, I know what kind you are
If I say no, I'm a bitch
Say yes I'm a slut, say yes I'm a slut
