[Chorus]
I'm back
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back
I'm back in the saddle again

[Verse 1]
Riding into town alone
By the light of the moon
I'm looking for all Sukie Jones
She crazy horse saloon
Barkeep give me a drink
That's when she caught my eye
She turned and gave me a wink
That made a grown man cry

[Chorus]
I'm back
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back
I'm back in the saddle again

[Verse 2]
Um, come easy, go easy
Alright until the rising sun
I'm calling all the shots tonight
I'm like a loaded gun
Peeling off my boots and chaps
I'm saddle sore
Four bits gets you time in the racks
I scream for more
Fool's gold out of their mines
The girls are soaking wet
Ain't no tongue's drier than mine
I'll come when I get back

[Chorus]
I'm back
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back
I'm back in the saddle again

[Bridge]
Riding
I'm loading up my pistol
You know I'm riding
I really got a fistful
You know I'm riding
I'm shining up my saddle
Can you see me, I know, I'm riding
This snake is going to rattle

[Chorus]
I'm back
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back
I know you see me
I'm back in the saddle again

[Outro]
I'm riding high
I'm riding high
Riding high
I'm riding high
I'm riding high
I'm riding high
Back, back, b-back, back, back in the saddle in the again
Back, back, back, b-back, back, back in the saddle in the again
Back, back, back, b-back, back, back in the saddle in the again
Back, back, back, b-back, back, back in the saddle in the again
Come on with me man
I'm riding high
I'm back in the saddle again
