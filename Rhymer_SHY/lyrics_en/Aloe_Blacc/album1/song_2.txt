[Chorus]
All I want for Christmas, yeah, is you (I said it now)
All I want for Christmas, yeah, is you (I said it now)
All I want for Christmas, yeah, is you (I said it now)
All I want for Christmas, yeah, is you (I said it now)

[Verse 1]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There's just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day

[Pre-Chorus]
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
'Cause all I want for Christmas is you

[Chorus]
All I want for Christmas, yeah, is you (I said it now)
All I want for Christmas, yeah, is you (I said it now)
All I want for Christmas, yeah, is you (I said it now)
All I want for Christmas, yeah, is you (I said it now)

[Verse 2]
I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
And I'm just going to keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click

[Pre-Chorus]
I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do?
'Cause all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

[Chorus]
All I want for Christmas, yeah, is you (I said it now)
All I want for Christmas, yeah, is you (I said it now)

[Bridge]
All the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children
The laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need?
Won't you please bring my baby to me?

[Verse 3]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just want to see my baby
Standing right outside my door

[Pre-Chorus]
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
'Cause all I want for Christmas
Is you

[Chorus]
All I want for Christmas, yeah, is you (I said it now)
All I want for Christmas, yeah, is you (I said it now)
All I want for Christmas, yeah, is you (I said it now)
All I want for Christmas, yeah, is you (I said it now)
All I want for Christmas, yeah, is you
All I want for Christmas, yeah, is you
All I want for Christmas, yeah, is you
All I want for Christmas, yeah, is you (I said it now)
