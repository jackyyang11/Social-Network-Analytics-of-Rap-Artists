[Echoes]
Yo
It's a blind world
Yo

[Verse 1]
What is the world coming to?
The way I feel about my life right now is as if I don’t
Do something quick that I might end up sick or homicidal
Appreciate the blessings lingering in my vibrato
Administrate the lessons I’m singing in my recital
Give it another title, call it the daily bread
A special formula you fix to get the baby fed
It's brain food, that kind they ooze into a baby’s head
So he won’t be misled and when the baby’s dead
Bury him where they buried Terry just to grow a tree up
They cutting down the rainforest looking for space to free up
And paving paradise with parking lots where buildings be up
What is the world coming to? It’s really messing me up
I got a brand new nephew in about a year
His lungs will be older than he is from the cloudy air
Not saying cloudy like the molecules of H20
I’m talking about the factories and fumes, whatever you know
And every time I’m driving, I’m thinking "I’m such a culo!"
My contribution of pollution isn’t very cool though
But what am I to do though? I got to work to live
And if I happen to be living where my working is
Then will I ever learn to celebrate it through my kids
One day I’ll have 'em maybe but first I need a lady
And will I give her all my time and will she really love me
And will she give me shelter when the storms are up above me
I know sometimes it be my personality is ugly
And no amount of make up can make up for that
But know I recognize a game and when I’m up to bat
I’m gonna put a little change into the thinking cap
Because to change the world you gotta change your mind
We can’t go on living wrong inside of the same design
It gotta be that you and me agree to make a difference
Put up a canvas and manipulate the color pigments
To paint a portrait of tomorrow full of broader figments
In your imagination could you imagine nations?
At peace and harmony instead of genocidal warring
Where borders don’t exist and nobody’s considered foreign
Mother Earth is respected, animals are protected
Society perfected, Capitalism's rejected
What is the world coming to? Almost the end of us
And it’s the evils in the world today we tend to trust
How could we let the ashes crumble till they come to dust
I guess that’s what is meant to happen if you blind enough
If you ready for what is coming, then come on with me
Follow my voice, if you can hear it let the song lift me
Into the graces of Heaven’s hugs, to learn love’s embrace
And share with every beautiful face
I place my right hand on my heart
And say, let me be the start
I pound my fist on my chest and request
Allow me to be the test, and when I’m at my best
I can make a Catholic priest confess
Cause guilt is worse than the parasite in his flesh
And the flesh is weak but the pride is strong
And it can make a little lie last a little bit longer
Than it was ever intended by whom ever intended to send it
Watch the evil manifest that it rendered
And I hope you remembered your place in this
Look up at a shooting star, go 'head and make a wish
Hopefully it will be granted by the gods
Against all odds you’ll be wise enough to see through the facades
What is the world coming to? I wish I had a answer
Better than seeing human beings as a living cancer
Better than being what I’m seeing hope I have a chance to
Raise the consciousness
Peace ya’ll and god bless
