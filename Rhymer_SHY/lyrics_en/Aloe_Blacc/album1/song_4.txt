[Hook x2]
You know I got you
I got you where I want you
You can't run from me
And you can'd hide from me now

[Verse 1]
Lay down
Don't say a word
Please don't move
Calm your nerves
Just relax
I got your back
Hold you down
Get comfortable
I'm in control
Love your body now
Open up
Let me in
This is [?]

[Pre-Hook]
I can see the look in your eyes
When I'm inside
You can even scream if you like
When you arrive

[Hook ]

[Verse 2]
So beautiful
Your face my dear
The way you look
When you're almost there
And when you walk
The way you sound
It makes me
Wanna be down town

[Verse 3]
Scream if you want like its your party
Dance with my hands all over your body
Taking of your g-string oh my lordy
How you did with your pants still on? You naughty
Find some paper and a pencil or a pen quick
Write down everything you ain't did yet
Write down all the things that you wanna do
That's probably all the things I'm gon' do to you
If not now then the next time we get up
When you think about get your 'uh' all wet up
Meet me at your place we can go head up
And let me see that look, I wanna see that look now
