[Verse 1: Moe Gang]
All my niggas got sauce, all my niggas got spice
Crack cocaine in the life
100 thousand 1's on dice
Nice hotel, it's her life
$1500 just to hit that twice
Nintendo 64 in my Glock at night
Pussy nigga chirpin' nigga that's your life
Drip on a nigga, this an easy ass sight (Whoo!)
Cold, than a motherfucker
Got Hoes like a motherfuker
Drip salt like a motherfucker
Yellow, Gold, Green, you know I cough like a motherfucker
Gold rims Christian Tucker
Drip sauce to my brother

SAUCE!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Saucho Saucy (Sauce Twinz)]
I'mma show you niggas how to drip
I'mma show you niggas how to splash
Robin jeans sittin' on my ass (on my ass)
4 rip 2 on the dash, and I got a pistol in the stash
Your main bitch trash, looking like JJ Fish
Man I wouldn't pimp that bitch, wouldn't touch that bitch
I don't know that bitch
Sauncho wouldn't fuck that bitch
I'm a motherfucking G
Let me drip real quick
Let me pimp real quick
I'm a pimp in this bitch
I'll break your bitch
I'll take you bitch straight to the fucking condo
Sell pussy out my condo
Got guns like rambo
I'm Sauncho, and I got a Gucci poncho
More Sauce than a Lambo
SAUCY!

[Hook]

These hoes nasty, warm champagne
All my nigga's drippin', saucy situation
Baddest bitches strippin', started as a waitress
Pussy kinda sore, fuck a new bitch
