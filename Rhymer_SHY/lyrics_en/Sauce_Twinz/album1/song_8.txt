[Chorus]
All my niggas is creatures (they creatures)
I put that on Jesus (on Jesus)
AK's and street sweepers, my niggas a reach ya
I'm down for my people, but a fuck nigga ain't gettin' no features (not ever)
All you fuck niggas ain't gettin' no features (no way) (not ever)
I can't hear wit no fuck nigga
Can't get no sec wit no fuck nigga
Never chat wit no fuck nigga
Never take a rock for a fuck nigga
You a fuck nigga
And you fuck niggas ain't gettin' no features

[verse 1]
Nigga fuck a feature, pussy I don't need ya
Rappers ima eat ya, rappers ima creature, rappers ima teacher
Call me Hakeem (Hakeem)
Call me the dream (the dream)
Lost the purp, but now we sippin' the green
We gotta lean, fuck do you mean?
All you niggas rappers, all you niggas cappers
All you niggas actors, all you niggas not factors
Smoke a nigga like tobacco
Close the book and your chapter
You [?], you [?]
Sauce
And now, I'm tellin' the truth, I'll show you the proof
Ask about me bitch I'm triller than you, so post it as you
212 to braze wood in a taliban
I could bick back on 89, bleed a my man
And my [?], I'm a blood of the streets
They know me, you niggas is phony
You niggas jabroni's, nigga who yo big homie?

[Chorus]
All my niggas is creatures (they creatures)
I put that on Jesus (on Jesus)
AK's and street sweepers, my niggas a reach ya
I'm down for my people, but a fuck nigga ain't gettin' no features (not ever)
All you fuck niggas ain't gettin' no features (no way) (not ever)
I can't hear wit no fuck nigga
Can't get no sec wit no fuck nigga
Never chat wit no fuck nigga
Never take a rock for a fuck nigga
You a fuck nigga
And you fuck niggas ain't gettin' no features (never) (not ever)

[verse 2]
Nigga fuck your plug, nigga fuck your ice
Probably went to college, probably had a job
Mama raised you right, now you sippin' sprite
Now you drug dealin', now you thug livin'
Till a nigga run up on you wit a pistol, is you still wit it?
Nigga up the 40 on ya broad day, hit ya face wit it
Ain't no balls nigga, ain't no laws nigga, boom ya fall nigga
Unlike y'all niggas I'm really out here, and I'm bout it
My mama smoked dope when I was comin' up
I ain't have nobody
But the streets, and my daddy
I thug nigga
Cold cases, [?]
Pimp hoes from foreign races, and sell dope to [?] chasers
Really though? (Really)
Thought I told you niggas I am so Diddy hoe (Diddy Diddy) (I'm Diddy)
And I'm a be the nigga that's gone bring back the mother fuckin' city hoe (on sauce)
Oweeee, sauce dat
Splash town that's my city, and the feature pussies ain't gettin' that

[Chorus]
All my niggas is creatures (they creatures)
I put that on Jesus (on Jesus)
AK's and street sweepers, my niggas a reach ya
I'm down for my people, but a fuck nigga ain't gettin' no features (not ever)
All you fuck niggas ain't gettin' no features (no way) (not ever)
I can't hear wit no fuck nigga
Can't get no sec wit no fuck nigga
Never chat wit no fuck nigga
Never take a rock for a fuck nigga
You a fuck nigga
And you fuck niggas ain't gettin' no features (not ever) (never)
