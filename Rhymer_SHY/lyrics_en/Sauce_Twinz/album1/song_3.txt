[Intro: Sauce Walka]
Aye, man, say, man, Sauce on the way man
I'm tired of hearing all these motherfucking niggas rapping about trapping bricks, guns, they've killed everybody, man, niggas ain't never did a motherfucking thing, man
Imma just keep it real and spill, talk about this shit the Twinz really did tho, you underspill me?
It's all about the drip bro

[Hook: Sauce Walka]
It's all about the drip, It's all about the drip
It's all about the drip, It's all about the drip
Fuck the cars and whips, fuck the guns and clips
Fuck the plugs and bricks, its all about the drip
It's all about the drip, It's all about the drip
It's all about the drip, It's all about the drip
Fuck the cars and whips, fuck the guns and clips
Fuck the drugs and bricks, its all about the drip

[Verse 1: Sauce Walka]
I made it out, out the drip though
Buscemi bug on my big toe
300 thousand my front door
And that is my second house, hoe
Grand piano by my couch bro
20 thousand in my mouth, hoe
I meet these rappers and I see they lives
You ain't sell [?]
You was selling burgers and fries
Value meals, dollar twenty-nine
I was really selling pills and pies
But I hated selling hams and dimes
My momma smoked work when I was 5
I knew that selling dope was alive
I broke a bitch and it changed my life
I hate when fake niggas claim these stripes
You can't get credit if you ain't lived this life
In every song niggas catch a body
But you ain't never ever shot nobody
Your brother sold dope, you rap about it
Oops, my bad I meant to say your cousin
Lying on them songs got you buzzy
Catch me dripping sauce out in public
Everything I rap about, I've done it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Sosamann]
It's all about the drip, it's all about the spill
In the splash I'm dripping sauce, no Ragu
I'm Big Sosa, got some bad news, I'm going nuts, no cashews
I told her meet me by the bathroom
I broke lil mama she was half Jew
The other half, she was hispanic
I'm dripping sauce and I'm causing damage, dammit
Sit down if you can't stand it
Sipping lean, I don't do the brandy
Sipping lean, I don't do the worm
Yellow mama, yeah, yeah, you're fine
Yeah, yeah, you're more dinner down
But I need it, on [?]
That's a [?], off the cobs
I remember I was [?]
When it was all about the crack
When it was all about the sack
When it was all about spend your money, flip the pack, nigga, get it back
Top suit, what I say the truth, now I [?], fool

[Hook]
