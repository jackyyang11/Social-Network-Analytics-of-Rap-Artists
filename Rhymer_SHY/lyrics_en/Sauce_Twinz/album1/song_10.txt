The way I drip sauce, it's amazing
The way I live my life, this shit be amazing
I got a foreign bitch and what she do with me?
Drip her down, splash time, this shit amazing
It's amazing, it's amazing
The way I live my life, this shit be amazing
It's amazing, it's amazing
Stay fuckin' nigga hoes, it's amazing

[Verse 1: Sauce Walka]
My car got wings on it, that's amazing
This kush that I'm smoking dry as a raisin
My bitch got a big booty, Jody Blazer
I pull up with a bitch, woo, she Asian
Chinese, blowing weed, big trees, I'm amazing
My bitch, she white, her daddy Patrick Swayze
Pull up in a motherfuckin'- I don't even know
Niggas be talking about the hoods, but they don't even go
I swear on sauce, oohwee, that's me, I'm amazing
I ain't never had a job, but a nigga got a whole lot of paper
Ciabatta, I'm amazing running from the coppers
Clear the fence without even touching that bitch, I'm so straight Johnson

[Verse 2: Rodji Diego]
Jehovah blessed me with this flavor, shit amazing
Amen, hallelujah, thank God, nigga goodness gracious
Green lean got me mean, nigga you could taste it
Icy Rolex faces got these hoes chasing
Momma told me "Roy, chill boy, be patient"
But she don't understand this flavor, so I'm catching cases
Stomp a nigga out like a step show
Thug life nigga like I'm Death Row
Sipping on pink like Pepto
What the fuck you think I got a tec for
Hoes on a nigga at the front door
Bitches passing out like promo
Nigga kick flavor like a dojo
Til they ass death like soso
Fuck 12, never liked popo
Love a ho, nigga that's a no no
Cause feelings up and down like a pogo
Nigga came right back in the four door, that's flavor
