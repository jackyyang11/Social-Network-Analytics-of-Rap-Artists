[Intro]

[Verse 1: Sauce Walka]
These niggas slept on sanch
But ain't no rapper on [?]
So I can't be mad at ya close the chapter like it dont matter
Apply pressure Sauce Twinz gon sit together
Keep ya cheddar cuz that shit don't mean shit to me
To tell the truth this rap shit don't mean shit to me
And nah a nigga did shit for me
That's why i make em pay for the sauce cuz ain't shit for free
For me,at least and  that's on sauce
You can't lie to me, you rappers living miserably
I see the cars that you driving, fake Rolex watches
Man stop it (Man stop it)

[Verse 2: Sosamann]
Probably be in the same position
Dark highways, the same clothes, not getting paid
Knew nothing about the pimping till they put me on game
These niggas lame start doing the same thing
Big brother taught me the brand dripper starting pimping
I Broke a bitch five racks in one weekend
Niggas trippin fuck it time to sleep em
Pull it out, cock it back, air em out
Nigga this flavor last forever im a twin in it
CEO, baby twin, still the fucking man in it
Still fucking hoes this year, but still on some different shit
Shout out to big saunchy, Sauce Gotti and shit
OoooWeeeeee
