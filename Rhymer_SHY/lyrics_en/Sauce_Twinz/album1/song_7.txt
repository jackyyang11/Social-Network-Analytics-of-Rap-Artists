[Verse 1: Sancho Saucy]
All the hoes wanna know Sanchy
All the hoes wanna give me money
All the hoes wanna do my liturgi
Hit me on Sunday, cause I'm god
Meet me in church bitch, but Im a pimp
Pull her skirt bitch, I did it first bitch!
I'm a trendsetter
No love letters, I'm mayweather
No losses
Bitches with me they bosses
My niggas with me they bosses
I'm Jesus bitch where's my crosses? (I'm God!)
Sauce to death where's my coffin?
That loud pack where that at?
93 you gotta kidding me
You smoking regular I smoke supreme
Everybody wanna know the Sauce twinz
Everybody wanna be like me
Everybody wanna be me
Everybody wanna be Sanch
Make a bitch bring me punch
Take a bad bitch to westheiemer
Make her sell her pussy cause its fire
Bitch got a mouth like meyer

Look at my tire
Forgiatios on my tire
