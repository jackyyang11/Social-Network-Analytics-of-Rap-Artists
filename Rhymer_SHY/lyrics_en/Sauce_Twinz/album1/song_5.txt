Fuck the bitch, Fuck the bitch. Fuck the bitch
Fuck the bitch, Fuck the bitch, Fuck the bitch
If she ain't making me no money
Then Fuck the bitch (fuck the bitch)
If she ain't making me no hundreds
Then fuck the bitch

[Verse 1: Sauce Walka: Sauce Twinz]
I know the sauce all on me, but the sauce costing' me
So bitch why you all on me, if you ain't part of me?
I'm taking these jerseys, these lost cause they calling' me
This bitch thank she know me
This bitch, cause she follow me
She see all the glamour, she see all the glisten
We rolling up switches. and riding in Benzs
She liking' my pictures. she see [Offset?] with me
But bitch is ya with me
Or bitch is you plotting on me tryna get me?
I don't trust you bitches (I don't)
No, no, no way
All my young niggas pimping
Like Payday Rose
I need all my money. bitch I need dollars
If the bitch ain't paying me then she holla
I need gualla, Sauce!!!

{Verse 2: Sancho Saucy: Sauce Twinz]
I just wanna pour my 10 toe
Pimped a bitch from Texas to California
The callin' me, they all on me
And I better get sleep
Because the bitch, she keep stalking me
Fuck tha Bitch, Fuck tha Bitch
She made me rich, Mariah - Nick
Fuck a brick
Can't loose the Benz, no no, no no
I made her pay, everyday (everyday)
I'm pimping the bitch, and sending the bitch
Not bending the bitch, you loving the hoe
She making me rich, what's wrong with you?
That bitch do exactly what I tell her to
And Sauncho Saucy, she lost in the sauce fool
