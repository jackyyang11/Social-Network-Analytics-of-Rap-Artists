[Intro]
Yeah
Ha ha ha ha ha
Hey

[Verse 1: Hard Target & Cymple Man]
I’m sauced up like Post Malone
And I’m underground like a gophers home
That bell will ring like a mobile phone
I disconnect your neck broken bones
Get your lip swole now you need Cortizone
Lookin' like the logo for the Rolling Stones
We goin' in like an open home
But I'm focused knowin' our hope is gone
And I'm bat shit, and I'm coo-coo
When that track hits, I get screws loose
And that ratchet, that does hat tricks
With no magic and no voodoo
You better ask them, closed caption
I want access, to your Hulu
I got a bad bitch, like Brad Pitt
She got ass tits, and cooks noodles, ha

[Pre-Chorus: Cymple Man]
Shit I was born and raised in the middle of nowhere
My mama told me son, this life ain't no fair
You better stand (better stand)
'Cause I won’t be there to hold your hand (hold your hand)
Don’t you worry 'bout me I’ll be a man

[Chorus: Hard Target, Cymple Man, Both]
I’m all grown up and this world ain’t never give me shit
Throw that whiskey in my cup, that why I’m drinkin' for the hell of it
You keep tryin' to tell me somethin' I ain’t listenin' for nothin'
Singin' woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I’m all grown up and this world ain’t never give me shit
Throw that whiskey in my cup, that why I’m drinkin' for the hell of it
You keep tryin' to tell me somethin' I ain’t listenin' for nothin'
Singin' woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2: Uncle Snap]
That whiskey’s up and that bass is down
Just gimme that mic don’t make a sound
Your face is frown when it came around
'Cause all my folks we stayin' down
We stayin' true they ain’t afraid of you
Just sayin' dude a lotta change in you
I stayed the same you changin' lanes
Just sit back and see what we came to do
I'm on another level baby you can check my status
South Georgia flatwoods rebel you better remember that
From trailer parks to private jets man I done seen it all
My middle of nowhere took me somewhere, believe it y'all

[Pre-Chorus: Cymple Man]
Shit I was born and raised in the middle of nowhere
My mama told me son, this life ain't no fair
You better stand (better stand)
'Cause I won’t be there to hold your hand (hold your hand)
Don’t you worry 'bout me I’ll be a man

[Chorus: Hard Target, Cymple Man, Both]
I’m all grown up and this world ain’t never give me shit
Throw that whiskey in my cup, that why I’m drinkin' for the hell of it
You keep tryin' to tell me somethin' I ain’t listenin' for nothin'
Singin' woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I’m all grown up and this world ain’t never give me shit
Throw that whiskey in my cup, that why I’m drinkin' for the hell of it
You keep tryin' to tell me somethin' I ain’t listenin' for nothin'
Singin' woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 3: Rooster]
Po-po-po-po poor white boy with the bass and the balls
Little backwoods drawl with the way I talk
I don't know a lotta folks gettin' down like that
Ain’t sayin' y'all trash but your rap game wack
Get mad at the Kickin' Up Mud track
Most cats play the one song and they go and judge off that
Take a minute take a listen to the lyrics
I bet that what your hearin' is a whole lot different
Than the boys talkin' loud got a belly full of beer
Gonna kill me a deer same time every year
Me I’m laughin' like y'all no fear
'Cause we out castin' lines off the pier
To make another dirt road ride party a miss
Don’t call it hick hop I don't like that shit
I do believe The Lacs earned a spot
So we changin' up the name to Dirt Rock

[Pre-Chorus: Cymple Man]
Shit I was born and raised in the middle of nowhere
My mama told me son, this life ain't no fair
You better stand (better stand)
'Cause I won’t be there to hold your hand (hold your hand)
Don’t you worry 'bout me I’ll be a man

[Chorus: Hard Target, Cymple Man, Both]
I’m all grown up and this world ain’t never give me shit
Throw that whiskey in my cup, that why I’m drinkin' for the hell of it
You keep tryin' to tell me somethin' I ain’t listenin' for nothin'
Singin' woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I’m all grown up and this world ain’t never give me shit
Throw that whiskey in my cup, that why I’m drinkin' for the hell of it
You keep tryin' to tell me somethin' I ain’t listenin' for nothin'
Singin' Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
