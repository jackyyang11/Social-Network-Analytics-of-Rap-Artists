[Verse 1: Rooster]
Caught me with a blindside, ambushed, nothin' less than sabotage
Started off my buddy now my moneys bein' camoflaged
I see 'em watchin', waitin', plottin' on my next mistake
It's aggravatin' gettin' paid from several different ways
I’m just a music man put a Gibson in my hand
Round me up a pen and pad, I'll write a song that's really sad
About a boy that gave it all to show up on the scene
He can play guitar and sing, but he joined the wrong team
Got a cut throat contract, somethin' like a kill shot
If and when you make it out you’re so lucky if you're still hot
Will not ever be a puppet on a string
Doin' everything you're trained man you got to stay away from the

[Chorus: Rooster]
Snakes in the grass don't be fooled when they tryin' to be smooth
Just lyin' waitin' on the crabs in the grass dig right through
Little loop holes all around all that you do
Ooh, ooh, they can sneak up from behind and get your ass
We’re so (that's right) cruel (ha ha ha) better watch out for the snakes layin' in the grass
Snakes in the grass

[Verse 2: Uncle Snap]
I guess a couple million dollars just lost in the wind
And a couple people lost that I thought were my friend
You put 'em in they place but they brought it again
In this industry first man it taught me to grin
In the face of the snake, tell the real from the fake
Learn to deal with the hate, sit back and know your place
More radio friendly and a little less attitude
Then they suck the creativeness right outta you
Then they mold you who they want you to be
And they only let you see who they want you to see
And a lotta these folks talk shit behind your back
Be the same sum'bitches wanna get you on the track

[Chorus: Rooster]
Snakes in the grass don't be fooled when they tryin' to be smooth
Just lyin' waitin' on the crabs in the grass dig right through
Little loop holes all around all that you do
Ooh, ooh, they can sneak up from behind and get your ass
We’re so cruel better watch out for the snakes layin' (yeah) in the grass
Snakes in the grass

[Verse 3: Hard Target & Cymple Man]
All these snakes with their spine bent, an ambush is there intent
Don't expect a bite because the venoms in the fine print
Similar to pythons with how they squeeze the life out
Your dreams they show you things you never seen and then it's lights out
Poisoned by a contract from a serpent of the industry
They're financial parasites and they envy creativity
I'm gettin' sick of all these labels pretendin' like they gonna help us
Like where was you when I was broke and I was feelin' helpless
'Cause they ain't give me no money just a marketin' plan
But the profits went in your pocket 'cause it's all was a scam
'Cause when that moneys comin' in it makes you wonder the worth
It's like you want your cut but you ain't doin' none of the work
I see them

[Chorus: Rooster]
Snakes in the grass don't be fooled when they tryin' to be smooth
Just lyin' waitin' on the crabs in the grass dig right through
Little loop holes all around all that you do
Ooh, ooh, they can sneak up from behind and get your ass
We’re so cruel better watch out for the snakes layin' in the grass
Snakes in the grass
