[Chorus]
I pop the cork off the wine bottle
Feelin' brand new like I hit the lotto
Tell everybody in the whole town
Tonight I’m gettin' down like James Brown (wow-wow-wow)
Tonight I’m gettin' down like James Brown (wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wow)
Tonight I’m gettin' down like James Brown (wow-wow-wow)
Tonight I’m gettin' down like James Brown (wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wow) (yeah, yeah)
Tonight I’m gettin' down like James Brown

[Verse 1: Cymple Man]
I’m gettin' fucked up way high stoned like a gravesite
You’re girl so excited like she Jesse up in Bayside
Great minds think alike, think not think I might
Be a bad motherfucker Ray Charles see it right
I’m on that boom boom boom
And you can tell I’m famous by my YouTube views
Yeah my momma told me stop and I should get up and go
But all you wack country rappers got me itchin' my dome
It goes one fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish
My team, too sick, y'all suck, two dicks
I dare one a y'all to say my name
I act a monkey motherfucker I orangatang
While a blue suit whip 'em Django Unchained
I go Cobain and turn your dogs to lo mein
I said my rhythm keep 'em in, I am too Soul Train
And can’t nobody tell me nothin'
Bartender keep 'em comin' I'm gone (comin' I'm gone)

[Chorus]
I pop the cork off the wine bottle
Feelin' brand new like I hit the lotto
Tell everybody in the whole town
Tonight I’m gettin' down like James Brown (wow-wow-wow)
Tonight I’m gettin' down like James Brown (wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wow)
Tonight I’m gettin' down like James Brown (wow-wow-wow)
Tonight I’m gettin' down like James Brown (wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wow)
Tonight I’m gettin' down like James Brown

[Verse 2: Rooster & Uncle Snap]
Gassin' up a [?] is not an option for us
I step away for a minute burn a jay by the bus
And now I’m blitzed, shit, I musta missed the opening act
So I hung around the back just to give her some dap
Now lets go and get some honeys from the crowd
Take ,em out to the country where they love to get down
Tried to tell him I'm a smooth lookin' talkin' walkin' son of an outlaw
I lay around the whole next day like a hound dog
I said pop the champagne cause' I’m runnin' for president
It’s the campaign and I’m drunk as I ever been
They’s a lotta talk and it's strictly irrelevant
I say kill 'em all and lets burn all the evidence
Commander in chief, [?] beef
And I a [?] voted man of the week
Its the land of the free I gotta handle a beat
And ain’t another motherfucker hold a candle to me
So lets go

[Chorus]
I pop the cork off the wine bottle
Feelin' brand new like I hit the lotto
Tell everybody in the whole town
Tonight I’m gettin' down like James Brown (wow-wow-wow)
Tonight I’m gettin' down like James Brown (wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wow)
Tonight I’m gettin' down like James Brown (wow-wow-wow)
Tonight I’m gettin' down like James Brown (wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wow) (ow, yeah, come on, huh)
Tonight I’m gettin' down like James Brown

[Verse 3: Hard Target]
Allow me to parental advise ya tonight we hyper
And we gettin' loaded up like a toddlers diaper
Vipers them fangs come out we just ravenous
So I’m grabbin’ every bottle in that liquor liquor cabinet
Runnin' with these savages fight clubs and night clubs (survey says)
We don’t give a fuck if you like us
Keep them little fifths we got handles (Rondo)
Say they ill as me but they can’t be (Mutombo)
I stay one hundo, microphone gunsmoke
It’s over pull the plug bro, your ass Gonzo
Wess makes the beats Jo Deen play the DJ
Me and Ryan pass the rhymes around like a relay
Your minutes up, prepay, storm the beach, D-Day
Why you look confused like Bruce Jenner in a three way (wow)
I'm the champ, pass the crown this way
We gettin' money in the mud like the Cassius Clay, I'm the greatest

[Chorus]
I pop the cork off the wine bottle
Feelin' brand new like I hit the lotto
Tell everybody in the whole town
Tonight I’m gettin' down like James Brown (wow-wow-wow)
Tonight I’m gettin' down like James Brown (wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wow)
Tonight I’m gettin' down like James Brown (wow-wow-wow)
Tonight I’m gettin' down like James Brown (wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wow)
Tonight I’m gettin' down like James Brown

[Outro]
Wow-wow-wow-wow
Bow-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wow
Wow-wow-wow-wow
Bow-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wow
Tonight I’m gettin' down like James Brown
