[Chorus]
I told my baby I would slow down
Ought to take another shot for all the times we missed
But you know how this can roll down
'Cause I'm too hard headed when I drink like this
(Blacked out chrome light)
But if the truck don't start and that roads too long
And the moon don't shine tonight
Then let my girl know I'd rather be alone
Mississippi here I come
So I'm out tryin' to catch me a ride
I'm too drunk to drive
(Blacked out drunk in my front yard)
I'm too drunk to drive
(Blacked out drunk in my front yard)
I'm too drunk to drive
(Blacked out drunk in my front yard)
I'm too drunk to drive
(Blacked out drunk in my front yard)
I'm too drunk to drive

[Verse 1: Rooster]
She hits the sack to sleep at night around nine
To me it's fine she won't be cuttin' in on my drinkin' time
And so I'm creepin' bein' quiet tryin' to get to the drive
She must've heard me stumblin' around 'cause then she flipped on the light
So it's on we fuss and fightin' breakin' bones
I guess I might be stayin' home and I'll be gettin' too stoned
I don't know she got my keys but not my money
Honey want me come and get me I'll be gamblin' down in Mississippi
Gettin' shitty

[Verse 2: Uncle Snap]
Now I'm catchin' my second wind and it's on
Ready to be anywhere but at home
I took a whole bottle straight to the dome
A couple more shots of the vodka I'm gone
I'm twisted and blisted and [?] the POD like a Bone song
So give me the whiskey, shoot it up with me
But the bottles long gone
The bourbon is swervin' and curvin'
When flashin' past it should say oh no
I'm mashin' the gas I might just pass and lookin' it's the po-po
I swing it around in the middle of town
Let's just see how it goes down
Day to the night my baby was right
Maybe I need to slow down

[Chorus]
I told my baby I would slow down
Ought to take another shot for all the times we missed
But you know how this can roll down
'Cause I'm too hard headed when I drink like this
(Blacked out chrome light)
But if the truck don't start and that roads too long
And the moon don't shine tonight
Then let my girl know I'd rather be alone
Mississippi here I come
So I'm out tryin' to catch me a ride
I'm too drunk to drive
(Blacked out drunk in my front yard)
I'm too drunk to drive
(Blacked out drunk in my front yard)
I'm too drunk to drive
(Blacked out drunk in my front yard)
I'm too drunk to drive
(Blacked out drunk in my front yard)
I'm too drunk to drive

[Verse 3: Cymple Man]
A bottle of Jim a bottle of Jack
I'm pushin' the throttle right down I won't crash
I swallow a shot and I'm wobbelin' back
More sooner than later I'll fall on my ass
Hey hey, tell my little buddy to pass me the glass
I said I would stop, believe it or not
But nothin' will stop me from throwin' 'em back
Gettin' blacked out 'til I fall out with straight shots bring 'em all out
First it's fireballs then it's Tylenol
I got work tomorrow and I'm a call out
In the front yard of some random house
Face down I'll be passed out
Cash gone and my phone lost
Say it's 'bout that time I tapped out

[Verse 4: Hard Target]
I'd probably be better to stop this I got no conscious
Poppin' the tops 'til I'm loud and obnoxious
Grovelin' in my own state of hypnotics
Since I surrendered my license to cops
It's like I've been drunker than ever before
Drivin' my lawnmower right to the store
Not sure how it's gonna work out
At the court house they smell beer when I step in the door
Alcohol we call out for
Malatovs our cocktail choice
Drink a fire truck of Fireball
'Cause we light up 'til we fall out boy
Arguin' late night all outdoors
In our neighbors yard makin' all that noise
'Til I call my boys to come pick me up
In the back of the truck yellin' haul ass George

[Chorus]
I told my baby I would slow down
Ought to take another shot for all the times we missed
But you know how this can roll down
'Cause I'm too hard headed when I drink like this
(Blacked out chrome light)
But if the truck don't start and that roads too long
And the moon don't shine tonight
Then let my girl know I'd rather be alone
Mississippi here I come
So I'm out tryin' to catch me a ride
I'm too drunk to drive
(Blacked out drunk in my front yard)
I'm too drunk to drive
(Blacked out drunk in my front yard)
I'm too drunk to drive
(Blacked out drunk in my front yard)
I'm too drunk to drive
(Blacked out drunk in my front yard)
I'm too drunk to drive
