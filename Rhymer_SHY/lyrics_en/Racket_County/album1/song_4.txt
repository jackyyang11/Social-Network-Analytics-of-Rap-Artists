[Verse 1: Uncle Snap]
I got a migraine splittin' and a motel tanline
The pool party hittin' last night it was damn fine
Thirteen people passed out at the pool
Now wake 'em up make 'em jump we 'bout to leave them fools
'Cause my Jim Bean habits got a habit of its own
I get drunk and try to sing every 90’s rock song
Now I’m jukebox jumpin' keep it bumpin' 'til my change gone
I'm out now, southbound, country roads take me home

[Chorus: [?] & [?]]
I live my life on the road
All day 'til the law come and get me like
I live my life on the road
Y’all don't wanna know y'all don't wanna know
Catch me runnin' through a red light e'ry night
Pushin' on the gas' til my [?] say it like, what
I live my life on the road

[Verse 2: Cymple Man]
Down in Mississippi sippin' on that Tennessee
You see me sippin' whiskey by the liter gettin' high in Pasadena
From Chicago to Ohio, West Virginia, Carolina
While Tarzan he married Jane in Michigan I married Juana
Yellin' turn up, turn up, everybody know it's us
Yellin' burn up, burn up, somebody please roll the dutch
Back in Oklahoma we drank enough to go in a coma
Back in Dallas tappin' Alice at Gas Monkey we towed up
You can take me back to Florida and you can take me back to Georgia
Everywhere I back it up whether I'm here or in New Orleans
Try to keep me back at home but then I hear the people callin'
Then I'm back out on the road like I never ever left it
From overseas to Canada bring me back home
We run it back and play again like it's a sad song
The higher I get the lower I go
I live my life like a show on the road I'm closer to home, I'm safe

[Chorus: [?] & [?]]
I live my life on the road
All day 'til the law come and get me like
I live my life on the road
Y’all don't wanna know y'all don't wanna know
Catch me runnin' through a red light e'ry night
Pushin' on the gas' til my [?] say it like, what
I live my life on the road

[Verse 3: Rooster]
Stretchin' and yawnin' ’bout who got the marijuana
We tore outta Georgia ended up in North California
Man we been drinkin' with everybody we party regardless
Outta be watchin' for law but instead this blonde got me stoppin'
Y’all know that Prevost is ridin' we wind up in Carolina
Tryin' to get back to the hizzy but these people keep whinin'
Man we so blessed, don’t bet on us ever quittin'
Hit up that number I gave you we’ll talk and see what your spinnin'
Listen we packin' up and rollin' out at five o’clock for mamas house
And fire up that ole GPS and find out what's the closest route
I know that we forgettin' somethin', microphones and shit for drummin'
Pedalboards and all the gear, I bet we don’t forget the beer
Eighty mile an hour party flyin' tryin' to cover ground
Pilots got a Hardies probably why I gained a bunch a pounds
Water fountain satisfaction gassin' up the diesel
Make some memories and money with my partyin' people
We goin' loud

[Chorus: [?] & [?]]
I live my life on the road
All day 'til the law come and get me like
I live my life on the road
Y’all don't wanna know y'all don't wanna know
Catch me runnin' through a red light e'ry night
Pushin' on the gas' til my [?] say it like, what
I live my life on the road

[Verse 4: Hard Target]
Set out to show the globe that I'm a microphone killer
So I’m on the road longer than a flattened armadillo
Up in Michigan they had a blizzard but we wasn't chillin'
We was rollin' on the ice ice baby like vanilla
Ohio it was fire though we was swingin' off the rafters
They was lovin' these old drunk ass crazy southern rappers
Shared the stage with Uncle Kracker it was packed and they was clappin'
And I swear to God my dogs Clay and Brian made it happen
You ain’t gotta like us you can try hard to ignore us
But I thank the lord for the support it's sorta euphoric
That Ford van is forced to forge ahead and stay on course
That's our work horse we live our life according to the chorus
We some Highwaymen like Waylon and Chris
I keep that straight six screamin' while I’m grippin' the fifth
'Cause when we show up it's a wrap you been given a gift
Jed Clampett on the mic boy it's a hit when I miss

[Chorus: [?] & [?]]
I live my life on the road
I live my life on the road
Catch me runnin' through a red light e'ry night
Pushin' on the gas' til my [?] say it like
I live my life on the road

I live my life on the road
All day 'til the law come and get me like
I live my life on the road
Y’all don't wanna know y'all don't wanna know
Catch me runnin' through a red light e'ry night
Pushin' on the gas' til my [?] say it like, what
I live my life on the road
