[Chorus: Rooster]
'Cause I ain’t never done a whole of shit talkin'
I earn my strikes and I ke-I keep walkin'
Bruise my face you can call that flossin'
For any punk bitch that wanna try to come cross me
'Cause I ain’t never done a whole of shit talkin'
I earn my strikes and I ke-I keep walkin'
Bruise my face you can call that flossin' (yeah)
For any punk bitch that wanna try to come cross me

[Verse 1: Uncle Snap & Rooster]
They say the louder the bark the softer the bite
It happens all the time and I ain’t talkin tonight
See I'm talkin' for life I just keep walkin' for spite
But you talkin' too hard so I ain’t walkin' tonight
You're tellin' all your folks he don’t look country to me
You're feelin' lucky little buddy go on touch me a see
See he wasn’t raised right little bad ass children
So come here and get this Racket County ass whoopin'
There's plenty room to show me what you’re feelin'
So get it off your chest so I can go back to chillin'
And I don’t know why you insist on talkin' shit son (shit son)
Lets get to scrappin' quit your yappin' come and get some (get some)
See talkin' lets me know that you are fake
Showin' off to your friends it mighta been a big mistake
Little lesson to learn to keep your eyes on the man with the lick
You keep on askin' for a brawl and it's what you're gonna get

[Chorus: Rooster]
'Cause I ain’t never done a whole of shit talkin'
I earn my strikes and I ke-I keep walkin'
Bruise my face you can call that flossin'
For any punk bitch that wanna try to come cross me
'Cause I ain’t never done a whole of shit talkin'
I earn my strikes and I ke-I keep walkin'
Bruise my face you can call that flossin' (yeah)
For any punk bitch that wanna try to come cross me

[Verse 2: Hard Target & Cymple Man]
I’ve tried hard to keep peaceful tendencies
But your level of respect will grow eventually to enemies
I hear all them snakes side conversations
But I'm broke and desperate and that's the wrong combination
I’m startin' to realize that it stems from fear
'Cause it’s crystal clear you gettin' nervous we here
I hear your whole agenda when your gums get to flappin'
Keep your name up out your mouth before somethin' bad happens
The situation would be different if you left out pride
We could handle this like gentlemen or step outside
'Cause I am not the one you ever wanna try to or threaten
Or get to the point where talkin' will be out of the question
Think that I'm kiddin' bitch you say a thing I'm hit 'em
You talkin' funny 'cause you got a little drink in your system
Believe me I'm with it I'm quicker you won't see that I did
The minute you step outta line and I'm a put you back in it
I thought I told you

[Chorus: Rooster]
'Cause I ain’t never done a whole of shit talkin'
I earn my strikes and I ke-I keep walkin'
Bruise my face you can call that flossin'
For any punk bitch that wanna try to come cross me
'Cause I ain’t never done a whole of shit talkin'
I earn my strikes and I ke-I keep walkin'
Bruise my face you can call that flossin'
For any punk bitch that wanna try to come cross me

[Verse 3: [?] & [?]]
Don't do it take a moment to think on it (think on it)
You still want it then buddy (what) you can bank on it
I'ma give it to you sure as the sun will rise
To make a long story short let me summarize (come on)
Crossin' me brings consequences and repercussions (yes)
I hope you comprehend English I'm not speakin' Russian (no)
I'm not speakin' Spanish (no) let me see how you manage (what)
Talkin' shit while eatin' on this knuckle sandwich
Damn it boy those suckers are bumpin' gums again
But they don’t walk that walk it must be fun to them
No sir I wasn’t raised that way
100% grown man I don’t play no games
Naw that shit talkin' is a character flaw
They ever push me to the point I swear I’ll bury 'em all
And they don’t wanna see that lead fly
'Cause we live by the code man it’s I4Ni come on

[Chorus: Rooster]
'Cause I ain’t never done a whole of shit talkin'
I earn my strikes and I ke-I keep walkin'
Bruise my face you can call that flossin'
For any punk bitch that wanna try to come cross me
'Cause I ain’t never done a whole of shit talkin'
I earn my strikes and I ke-I keep walkin'
Bruise my face you can call that flossin'
For any punk bitch that wanna try to come cross me

'Cause I ain’t never done a whole of shit talkin'
I earn my strikes and I ke-I keep walkin'
Bruise my face you can call that flossin'
For any punk bitch that wanna try to come cross me
'Cause I ain’t never done a whole of shit talkin'
I earn my strikes and I ke-I keep walkin'
Bruise my face you can call that flossin'
For any punk bitch that wanna try to come cross me
