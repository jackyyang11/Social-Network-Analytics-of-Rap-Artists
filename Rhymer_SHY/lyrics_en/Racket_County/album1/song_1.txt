[Chorus: Cymple Man]
'Cause I been travelin' this road alone
And tell my mama I ain't comin' back home
I said it's fine bury me with a bottle of jack
My 45 cocked still in my lap
The law man want me dead (let 'em know they ain't takin' me alive)
The law man want me dead (let 'em know they ain't takin' me alive)
I said it's fine bury me with a bottle of jack
My 45 cocked still in my lap
The law man want me dead

[Verse 1: Hard Target]
It's a viscious cycle throw a suitcase in my El Camino and then I get the rifle
Mama know I ain’t comin' back this time, she standin' on the porch cryin' while she grip the Bible
Blood shed could be in order my babies ready to ride and I'm comin' for her
Didn’t mean to fall in love with the sheriffs daughter, but that asshole feels like he can't support her
He gonna learn today ask for her hand in marriage
Tried to do this thing the earnest way
He had the nerve to say over my dead body
Be the only way well he should be concerned today
'Cause I'm comin' to get her without an invitation
Been anticipating this altercation so he can reassess this situation
But I’m on my way that's all I'm sayin'

[Verse 2: Rooster]
APB out on my truck
Go ahead and rev my cruisin' up
Let em all know I’m quick as hell
Hit him like Richard Jeff and Dale
Many might not be racin' fans
Smoke them peas like honey baked ham
Choke three nine three piston cams
Two front tires tryin' to make a stand
I’ll be damned you hand cuff me
Colt 45 might disagree
Ain’t it kinda funny how the shotgun
Rides shotgun like a triple OG
If you know me you know my mama
Wants my guns just like Obama
But I can’t do that
No way I straight up bang lets regulate

[Chorus: Cymple Man]
'Cause I been travelin' this road alone
And tell my mama I ain't comin' back home
I said it's fine bury me with a bottle of jack
My 45 cocked still in my lap
The law man want me dead (let 'em know they ain't takin' me alive)
The law man want me dead (let 'em know they ain't takin' me alive)
I said it's fine bury me with a bottle of jack
My 45 cocked still in my lap
The law man want me dead

[Verse 3: Cymple Man]
'Cause I been pissed you can sense this
Bets off when I walk through the entrance
Never watch my mouth or regret shit
I wreck shit I got a death wish
This bar right here I set this
You better withdraw I check shit
Better back step 'cause I crack necks
You’re the one way ticket to your last breath
I got problems nope no medications
I got a duffle bag full of all the heads I've taken
Think I’ll stop now boy you dead mistaken
I got hair triggers man I'm gettin' aggravated
White boy went nuts now he actin' shady
Law man want me dead 'cause I’m catchin' cases
And I ain’t goin' back in you can tell 'em all then
This time I’m goin' out with a bang (bang)

[Verse 4: Uncle Snap]
Lookin' at the clock it’s 8:05
Everything gonna stop and it ain’t no lie
Even those boys said I ain’t gonna ride
Better fight or run 'cause it ain’t gonna fly
I’m gonna ride 'til the end 'til the days go by
Them corners won't bend and I can’t go right to then end of the tunnel
Man that ain’t no lie they ain’t no sinner got a halo right

[Bridge]
Steady roll out, roll out keep it movin' don’t look back
You better hold now hold now 'cause them boys are all unstrapped
You better slow down slow down I don’t think you wanna do that
Cause when it go down go down some of us ain't comin' back

[Chorus: Cymple Man]
'Cause I been travelin' this road alone
And tell my mama I ain't comin' back home
I said it's fine bury me with a bottle of jack
My 45 cocked still in my lap
The law man want me dead
The law man want me dead
I said it's fine bury me with a bottle of jack
My 45 cocked still in my lap
The law man want me dead (let 'em know they ain't takin' me alive)
The law man want me dead (let 'em know they ain't takin' me alive)
I said it’s fine bury me with a bottle of jack
My 45 cocked still in my lap
The law man want me dead

'Cause I been travelin' this road alone
And tell my mama I ain’t comin' back home
I said it’s fine bury me with a bottle of jack
My 45 cocked still in my lap
The law man want me dead (let 'em know they ain't takin' me alive)
The law man want me dead (let 'em know they ain't takin' me alive)
I said it’s fine bury me with a bottle of jack
My 45 cocked still in my lap
The law man want me dead (dead, dead, dead, dead, dead)
