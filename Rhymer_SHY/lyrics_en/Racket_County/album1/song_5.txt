[Intro]
Yeah, ahh-ooh
Ha ha ha ha ha
Come on

[Verse 1: [?]]
Another shot of private stock yeah I'm the captain of this vessel
We gon' ride to Crooked River and do backflips up off the tressles
We a special kind of crazy, just young and feelin' free
Hold my beer and watch this, I'm fiddin' to zipline from this tree
'Cause back in the day it used to be Natty Light, on ice, dirt road
CD changer full of bangers, in the console got a blunt rolled
My better half she know I’m wild, she just shake her head and smile
And that look right there, means it's on, when we get home in a little while, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause she ain’t never seen a truck sittin' high like this
She ain’t never shot whiskey told to try a little sip
And baby girl you ain’t never took a ride like this
We gon' cruise until the sun comes up
And we gon' holler at the moonlight, ooh
And we gon' cruise 'til the sun comes up
And we gon' holler at the moonlight, Lord
(Got me feelin' like a dog better [?] when she calls)
Because I’m feelin' like a dog when I’m runnin' with my pack
For my baby girl I come right back
And we gon' holler at the moonlight
Yeah we gon' holler at the moonlight, ooh

[Verse 2: Uncle Snap]
I’m fuelin' up that old F-250
All I need to know is you rollin' with me
Got fifty-five dollars in my bank account low (bank account low)
And it don’t matter we don’t need it where we go (where we go)
There ain't no cover charge down by the creek (down by the creek)
And all we need is just a couple of sheets
And I ain't never met a girl (girl) who liked it so cheap
And you ain’t never met a guy (guy) that’s quite like me
A little creek side chillin' baby after it’s dark
Or some gator slide sittin' just countin' them stars
Just a fine pine blowin' slow and steady tonight
A little muscadine wine are you ready to ride, now alright

[Chorus]
'Cause she ain’t never seen a truck sittin' high like this
She ain’t never shot whiskey told to try a little sip
And baby girl you ain’t never took a ride like this
We gon' cruise until the sun comes up
And we gon' holler at the moonlight, ooh
And we gon' cruise 'til the sun comes up
And we gon' holler at the moonlight, Lord
(Got me feelin' like a dog better [?] when she calls)
Because I’m feelin' like a dog when I’m runnin' with my pack
For my baby girl I come right back
And we gon' holler at the moonlight
Yeah we gon' holler at the moonlight, ooh

[Verse 3: [?] & Rooster]
'Cause she a bad chick, cute in the face, thick in the back
But I’m the magic man, 'bout to pull a trick out of my hat
Told her I’m Ricky Bobby buddy, let's go racin' round in circles
Said I set that ass on fire, but I'll have you back by curfew
Then I, I take her ridin' but she just drivin' me crazy
While we cruisin' down a backroad, feel like we goin' eighty
My adrenaline is pumpin', I ain't settlin' for nothin'
While we holler at the moonlight, yellin' shit for nothin' like
Take a little [?] swig pass it 'round 'til we get right
Find some old school country heads, flip the headlights
Let the moonshine take us on a country road ride
Just a kiss from her whiskey, lips blowin' my mind
I’m a late night river ridin' 'round with my chick
Tryna park and lay the seat back to see what I get
Got it down sun rises 'round seven twenty-six
Plenty time to show you you ain't met a guy like this

[Chorus]
And we gon' holler at the moonlight, ooh
And we gon' cruise 'til the sun comes up
And we gon' holler at the moonlight, Lord
(Got me feelin' like a dog better [?] when she calls)
Because I’m feelin' like a dog when I’m runnin' with my pack
For my baby girl I come right back
And we gon' holler at the moonlight
Yeah we gon' holler at the moonlight

And we gon' holler at the moonlight, ooh
And we gon' cruise 'til the sun comes up
And we gon' holler at the moonlight, Lord
(Got me feelin' like a dog better [?] when she calls)
Because I’m feelin' like a dog when I’m runnin' with my pack
For my baby girl I come right back
And we gon' holler at the moonlight
Yeah we gon' holler at the moonlight, ooh
