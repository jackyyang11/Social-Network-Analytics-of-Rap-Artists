[Chorus: Uncle Snap]
I got no place to go so I turned on the radio
I set my cruise on 75 I let my seat back and just ride, just ride
I got no place to go so I turned on the radio (yeah)
I set my cruise on 75 (that's right) I let my seat back and just ride, just ride

[Verse 1: Uncle Snap]
I let me seat fall back now I’m county line bound
In a truck all black I don’t wanna see town
Gotta get my mind right, Jim Beam and Bud Light
It’s just one of them times where I could ride all night
I let my mind go, it’s just me and the road
Half a case of some grape, now I'm ready to roll
Just me and my thoughts and my cooler right beside me
Phone turned off, hope nobody can find me
They lookin' at me like he must be lyin'
I don’t say nothin' I just hush and ride
I hit the county road so the dust can fly
Then I crack open some of that muscadine
Stop at the creek let the radio boom
Bob Seger gonna speak with a little Night Moves
Lookin' at the moon, ain't a cloud in the sky
It’s clear in my mind, but I’m just here for the ride

[Chorus: Uncle Snap]
I got no place to go so I turned on the radio
I set my cruise on 75 I let my seat back and just ride, just ride
I got no place to go so I turned on the radio
I set my cruise on 75 I let my seat back and just ride, just ride

[Verse 2: Rooster]
I like to fly around town sometimes
Couple Alpines bumpin' tryin' to blow my mind (blow my mind)
Me and my boys dirt roadin' all night
Or it's me and my girl rollin' 'round sometimes
Sometimes I like to ride there ain’t no answer to why
I like to kick it by myself and don’t let nobody drive
I got some problems with my lady, can’t pay up my bills
Got me stressin' on a daily, I pop me a pill
And put the F-150 through the wind through the city
Got a lotta bad unforgiven sins ridin' with me
I’m gonna jack up the bass on them old school songs
When I go to vibin' don’t be tryin' to call me on my phone
Got to cancel out the wrong and get it right
It ain't nothin' got the ride and put some chillin' in your life
Gotta feelin' that it really ain’t as bad as it seems
Take a look at what it taught me then you’ll probably want to call me the breeze

[Chorus: Uncle Snap]
I got no place to go so I turned on the radio
I set my cruise on 75 I let my seat back and just ride, just ride
I got no place to go so I turned on the radio (Dodge City)
I set my cruise on 75 (lets do it baby, Racket County) I let my seat back and just ride, just ride

[Verse 3: Hard Target & Cymple Man]
Pu-pu-pu-pu-pushin' the pedal into the floor like a cellar door
Wood grain just like sycamore them speakers kickin' more of that
Racket County they start to ask about me
I'm in my truck rappin' like a hundred thousand fans around me
Buzzed off that adrenaline preparin' our hardest
'Cause when I cut on my radio all I'm hearin' is garbage
Hard Target and The Lacs and when this pair hit the road
I could never miss them days where I had nowhere to go, so let 'em know
Now I'm rollin' down the road with my radio up
No need to interrupt 'cause I never say enough
Its been too long waitin' for a chance I can move on
I been given half as much without a coupon
You can do what you want, you do right or you do wrong
Life has got me switchin' stations just to hear a new song
And I'm gettin' older but I'm thinkin' like I'm too young
And the weathers gettin' colder so I think I'll throw some tunes on

[Chorus: Uncle Snap]
I got no place to go so I turned on the radio
I set my cruise on 75 I let my seat back and just ride, just ride
I got no place to go so I turned on the radio
I set my cruise on 75 I let my seat back and just ride, just ride
Just ride just ride just ride just ride just ride just ride just ride just ride just ride just ride just ride just ride just ride just ride
