[Intro: B.o.B]
All I ever really do is get high
All I ever really do
Yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus: B.o.B]
All I ever really do is get high
I used to skip school to get high
Doin' what I do to get high
Get high, no lie
All I ever really do is get high
I used to skip school to get high
Doin' what I do to get high
Get high, no lie, no lie

[Verse 1: London Jae]
Used to get high just to get by
Now I'm gettin' dry and I get fly, yo
Pop a vert with a Latina
Used to get a little, used to get dough
Now a young nigga wanna get more
Drop the top on the groove and get it movin' through the city with all the bitches now
Roll one up and light it, I'ma pass it 'round
I'm tryna get higher than your rap shit now, yeah yeah
Nigga did the type of weed to get a bitch on her knees
When you hit that flavor, she in the corner with her
Gotta get outta sight, I'm on a whole 'nother flight
They say the blue hurt, but they're yellow and black
Whoever got 'em I want 'em I'ma come get 'em, get 'em

[Chorus: B.o.B]
All I ever really do is get high
Used to skip school to get high
Doin what I do to get high
Get high, no lie, no lie
All I ever really do is get high
Used to skip school to get high
Doin what I do to get high
Get high, no lie, no lie

[Verse 2: London Jae]
Nigga used to skip school just to get high
Breakin' all the rules just to get high
Nigga used to act a fool just to get high
Now I'm grown, I'll take a bitch to Dubai to get high
Grab another perp, roll up another blunt
Gotta can come with me, gon' show roll another one
'Til a bitch quick, don't get dirty for 30
I'm up early with all the birdies, show 'em up early
Paint it like I been drinking bleach, I been up
[?]
Got the bitches they with me, they lickin' they kissin', they spittin' they stickin', they give me no hickin'
I hit it, I hit it, I'm in in a minute
I'm winnin', I'm winnin', I'm still in the kitchen
[?]
And the crew like a [?]

[Chorus: B.o.B]
All I ever really do is get high
Used to skip school to get high
Doin what I do to get high
Get high, no lie, no lie
All I ever really do is get high
Used to skip school to get high
Doin what I do to get high
Get high, no lie, no lie

[Verse 3: B.o.B]
Went to school, high first day of high school
Uh, 420 my IQ
Goin' ham pack, disappear like swine flu
Twisted guard, [?]
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a high nigga times two
Real, real, real nigga side you
Just to get by must I remind you
My old hood I drive through like [?]
Been at the mountain top, been through the valley
Spent so much at pin-ups, had to bring an accountant
Why call 'em friends if they ever serious?
Like why girls call it a perm if it's temporary?
Now look, just 'cause I'm in cuffs don't make me guilty
And just 'cause I'm rich don't make me filthy
They say you are who you are when you born off the rip
Well shit I must have been born with a spliff

[Chorus: B.o.B]
All I ever really do is get high
Used to skip school to get high
Doin what I do to get high
Get high, no lie, no lie
All I ever really do is get high
Used to skip school to get high
Doin what I do to get high
Get high, no lie, no lie
