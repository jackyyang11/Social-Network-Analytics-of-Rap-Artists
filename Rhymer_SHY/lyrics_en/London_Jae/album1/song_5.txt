[Verse 1]
Started from the bottom, feet planted in the mud
I was dead to the world
Fast forward a few years, now I’m touring round the world
All I want is some head from your girl
Green light, I got to go and get it
2007, I had a Honda Civic
Trafficking weed through the city, fuck the speed limit
And your club wasn’t shit unless my team in it
And your club wasn’t shit unless my team in it
Cause we winning
And your club wasn’t shit unless my team in it

[Hook]
Broke bitches make me nervous, I don’t want em round me
And I’m still on Cleveland, hustling for no reason
The same spot where Rich came and found me
Head over water, no more drowning
Hand the valet the Ferrari at the mall, they surround me
Feeling like a king, [?] that or be a dream
I’m balling like Kareem, how the fuck you niggas sounding
Broke niggas make me nervous, and I don’t want em near me
In a McLaren with Bobby, round the lobby, niggas don’t understand so they fear me
I’m in this bitch stacking racks to the ceiling
Tryna see a million
I got my motherfucking team now, green light

[Verse 2]
Young nigga with a million dollar dream
Got a billion dollar scheme
To get me some money and get the fuck up out the gutter
And never switch up on my niggas, going hard for the team
Tell the truth, I used to look up to a few niggas
Till I got me some money and saw their true colors
Shining hard, popping good, and them niggas around you ain’t got a pot to piss in
Nigga you a sellout
They don’t respect me, you don’t like a nigga, check it
Pull up on your set and get the motherfucking weapon
I got that motherfucking Smith & Wesson
Small thing to a giant, I’m from the jungle, and I’m kinging like a lion
Bitch I’m winning without trying
Know you made it when you spending without buying
Them pain killers tryna numb all the pain from the bullshit I seen in my life
It’s only two motherfuckers in the world I don’t trust
That’s niggas and bitches, that’s on my life
Small circle, nigga can’t stick a pen in it
Face deep in that pussy I got my chin it
I ain’t a gangster, I’m a player ho
And I’m moving round the city like the mayor ho
