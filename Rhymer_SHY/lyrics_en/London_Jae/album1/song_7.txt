[Intro]
DJ Scream

[Verse 1]
Sometimes you gotta, do what you gotta do to get to where you tryna be
I’m just here to assist you i’m not tryna judge u
Them sacrifices you made for them babies
I see you baby i’m just tryna love you ahh
More than commitment you more than a mistress
Just keep curving them niggas ignoring them bitches
They don’t wanna see you one bae
Fucking with them gon have you going down the wrong way
I know you shaking that ass getting all the tips you can
Just to pay back uncle sam that’s some bullshit
I know you, that you looking for a man that will halfway understand what you going through
I’m just showing you a better way to go
Go an let it up you can handle yours
4am you hit the door and do your chores
Check on them kids
Made a few mistakes in your past and now you sit back and laugh
Like look at the shit I did

[Hook]
Do what you doing just to get to where you going and I see you baby
Don’t think I don’t notice you baby
Do what you doing just to get to where you going and I see you baby
Don’t think I don’t notice you baby
Do what you doing just to get to where you going and I see you baby
Don’t think I don’t notice you baby
Do what you doing just to get to where you going and I see you baby
Don’t think I don’t notice you baby

[Verse 2]
Wait for me baby just wait for me baby
Pray for me baby please pray for me baby
Myself did a lot a shit so i’m greatful baby
But God don’t make no mistakes so just stay with me baby
Weight of the world on ma shoulders I got em
From nothing to something these niggas a problem
And bitches scream when they see me it’s so surreal
And these niggas wish they could be me just tell em plug in they TV cause i’m on now
Did it on ma own now just the first to say you did it
Everything clone now
Righting all ma wrongs now
Writing all ma songs down
Can’t say you made it bitch I done signed it and date it
I’m getting faded with bitches that’s only here cause i’m famous
And all these niggas around me they only screaming we made it (oh yeah)
Made a few mistakes in ma past now i just sit back and laugh
Bought ma mom a new [?] seat

[Hook]
Do what you doing just to get to where you going and I see you baby
Don’t think I don’t notice you baby
Do what you doing just to get to where you going and I see you baby
Don’t think I don’t notice you baby
Do what you doing just to get to where you going and I see you baby
Don’t think I don’t notice you baby
Do what you doing just to get to where you going and I see you baby
Don’t think I don’t notice you baby

[Bridge]
I see you baby I see you baby
I see you baby I see you baby
I see you baby

[Outro]
So the other day I was at the gas station
Before they made me [?]
I logged into this young man by the name of London and
I noticed he had a few things into his hands
He had two styrofoam cups stacked on to each other
He had a few umm, i’m not sure what they looked like thing that i take when i get uhh
My back start hurting, he had a few of those in his hands
And i asked i said son what’s in your cup
And he, i can’t really explain what he said
Whatever he said to me, he told me that he had Texas in his cup
And i said but son, how did you fit the whole state inside your cup
