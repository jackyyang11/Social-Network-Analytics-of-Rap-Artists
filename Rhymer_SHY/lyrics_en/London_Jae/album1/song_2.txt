[Intro]
Salute to the streets
This the long awaited mixtape my niggas
London Jae
Swampizzle
Scream

[Verse 1]
I got pain killers homie
I got yo bitch with me she ride me like a pony
Clique a gorillas and you monkey niggas phony
I'm in ma town i'm swerving Bruce they call me Tony
London big homie only bad bitches round me
Baddest in the town fattest ass I done see in a while
Drag her through the mud fuck her kick her out
You the type a nigga kiss her in the mouth
None time nigga spent fitting on the Rolie
When I gas in the car nigga sliding through the city
Top down in the Bentley 5 racks on the kick homie walking on the ceiling
5 racks on yo bitch cause she digging them [?]
Young nigga fly as a Pilot
Mention ma name and they riot
I just want the brain keep the science i'm king like a lion
You selling i'm buying if she bad ima try it
Feel like all them other diamonds i can barely see the time
Really nigga and I ain't even lying

[Hook]
Popped a percocet then I popped another one
I feed yo hoe the Zans she asking for another one
I do the dash and crash the coupe and copped another one
This ain't the presidential Rollie this another one
Popped a percocet  then I popped another one
I feed yo hoe the Zans she asking for another one
I do the dash and crash the coupe and copped another one
This ain't the presidential Rollie this another one

[Verse 2]
These fucking pain killers in me
I had her fuck my tolerance feel like infinity
I'm fly as fuck man i been walking on them Jimmy's
That monster truck sit up i'm taller than your chimney
Bitch you ain't offending me
Bitch you ain't a friend to me
More like a frenemy
She rolling with a different Molly screaming put it into me
Old school Chevy (new motive)
[?] loud no order
Straight at the bars no soda
Nigga didn't believe me I told em
Did it on ma own no hand out
Told em I was going she was going
She was foreign i'm the man now
Now a nigga soaring world tour a nigga stand out
Hold on these bitches all over me like a ten now
Nigga sleeping on a player wake him up
Or fuck it leave dead somebody bring me my meds
I'm getting scared

[Hook]
Popped a purse sudden then I popped another one
I feed yo hoe the Zans she asking for another one
I do the dash and crash the coupe and copped another one
This ain't the presidential Rollie this another one
Popped a purse sudden then I popped another one
I feed yo hoe the Zans she asking for another one
I do the dash and crash the coupe and copped another one
This ain't the presidential Rollie this another one

[Outro]
