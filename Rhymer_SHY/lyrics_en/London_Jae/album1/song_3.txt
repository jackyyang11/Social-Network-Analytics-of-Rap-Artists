Spending dollars on designers and clothes
Smoke the weed till my mind in control
Bought me a chopper fuck these niggas
Getting me some money fuck these bitches

Stunning with a gun in ma hand and a bomb in ma pants
Try me run up on the street light

Keep the shoebox full of rubber bands
Ima wrap em round grands i知 just making sure I eat right
Till the day that i知 gone ima put it in the song
Ima live by the code of the street life
