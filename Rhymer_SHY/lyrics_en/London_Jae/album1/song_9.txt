[Verse 1 – London Jae]
I just came to party
She just came to dance
But the way she staring and the way I’m feeling
I might take a chance
Moving her body
Grabbing my hand
If we get any closer Imma kiss on her shoulder
Imma pull off my pants, oh!
I just want to take you, want to ride on you like we had all night
We can go and see the stars
We can lay across the moon, we can love in the light
Just tell me you ready to go
Just one more drink and we roll
All I can see is you climbing on top of me
Girl take this ride with me
Won’t you come fly with me?

[Hook]
Bottles in the air, models everywhere
Party over here, it’s always a celebration
With you
Bottles in the air, models everywhere
Party over here, it’s always a celebration
With you
She just want to party like it’s New Year’s Eve
(And I'ma let her do whatever she want)
She just want to party like it’s New Year’s Eve
(I got to let her do whatever she like)
She just want to party like it’s New Year’s Eve
(I got to let her do whatever she wanna)
It’s always a celebration when I’m with you

[Verse 2 – Scotty ATL]
You’re tense lil mama, I told her to cool off
I had to wear her like the summer to park in the pool lot
Suck the dick like a [?], just like a torpedo
I be in and I don’t even want to fucking pull out
To her family she a saint, she a good girl
Get her to the pad, cut some Luther on the pad
Shawty open up like a school notepad
She about her business, I ain’t even gone flat
Make a nigga want to clear his schedule
Hit it couple times, then a couple more
She don’t even ask, want to hustle though
I don’t even trust hoes, but I trust her though
