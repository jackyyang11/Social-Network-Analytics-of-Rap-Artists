[Hook]
I been looking Truth...
I been looking Truth...
I been looking Truth yea yea


[Verse:1]
I been looking for it
I been searching for it
These bitch and nigga they lie all the time
Can't keep it aye one with day ones
The lost
Claiming that they real but they faker than a old 100
Calming that they real but they faker than a blue 100
Money change too
I should known when I slipped o couldn't hang wit yu
Now this bars on my phone like a tailers booth
Block all the haters tryna come thru
Tryna getchu a peek
While let give yu the scope
I'm bout kill the game it nothing else to do
I'm something new
Yu aimed at me guess what I'm bulletproof
I'm bouncing back like drose do

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Can yu handle it
Can yu face it
Cuz the truth is something we not in bracing
The way we lying it's like we in the matrix
The truth is in us and we ain't even speaking
I been lying to my self too
I'm tryna find myself too
At least I'm not afraid to admit it
Abuse liquor cuz it really take the pain away
Smoke dope just to get high and elevate
Now sitting on cloud nine
Thinking bout my last couple lines
Wasn't need but I said
Back to the topic at hand
Fuck 12 before I end
They some liers too
Safe off the gun and now they aiming at yu
Yu heard a sound but it wasn't the truth
