Oh my word
It's who, who?

Rain and shower
When I'm on the riddiddim I merk and duppy
Nah, I'm no carbon copy
Straight to the top of the stairs like Rocky
Go to the gym I want to get a bit stocky
So if a wasteman want to get cocky
I'll, I'll shower man ting
And man's going to want to [?] and suck cocky
Must be the drink it must be the rocky
How could this guy every get it twisted
I'm gully but your music's poppy
I told you before I merk and duppy
Us man are hard and them man are floppy
Can't be talking to me, best not be
Cos man will come to the ends with a shotty
I don't know what, makes him think he's a hotty
Cos cos cos, nah

[Hook]
Nah I don't know about that mate
You merk me nah I don't know about that mate
You hurt me nah I don't know about that
That, cos it's not that again
Jump on the riddim, man go black again
Ready for the war, Launch an attack again
Do this thing so they can't come back

Cos I'm that lyrical killer
Go in the war, come out the winner
Like Pac-Man, I'm that man
I'm a predator you're my dinner
Look at the shit you got yourself inna
All this long talking man are inna
Soon as my shots go in ya
I'll disappear like ninja
750 ninja, could've been Bolt
Could have been a sprinter
Bullets will catch you
Bullets will enter
Send a man under the ground like Splinter
I'm cold like winter
When I'm into merking that's what I'm into
Kick up a storm, bill up a stinker
You're not a badman, you're just a drinker
Just know

[Hook]
I don't about that mate
You merk me nah I don't know about that mate
You hurt me nah I don't know about that mate
Nah, nah I don't know about that
That, cos it's not that again
Ready for the war, Launch an attack again
Do this thing so they can't come
Yeah I do this thing so they can't come back

[x2]
When I spit my verse, you get sent to bed like Night Nurse
If you want to test me you better have a tight verse
Draw for the war, draw for the [?] verse
Draw for your heavy, draw for your best verse
Which one of yous lot want to test first?
Which one of yous lot want to test
Just know
