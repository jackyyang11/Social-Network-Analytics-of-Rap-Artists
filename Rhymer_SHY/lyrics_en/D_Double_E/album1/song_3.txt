[Intro]
Oh my word
Hold tight SX
Big up all the StayFresh mandem
Oh my gosh

[Verse]
Budebutbut, budebutbut
Man on the microphone bad to the badabada
Man on the microphone, bad to the bone
Listen to my lyrical tone
On the microphone, man are bad to the badabada
Man on the microphone bad to the badabada
Bad on the microphone bad to the bone
Listen to my lyrical tone
Listen to my, cause, cause
I think I need pen and paper
Think it time to bun another faker
Do me an MC turn translator
Mix my data with their data
But what does that equal, blud imitator
If you deny that blud, you're a hater
I can hear your style's getting baiter
Don't you know that I'm the originator?
Do my ting on the road medicator
Serving food but I ain't no waiter
Might do my own be making my paper
Papapa blud I make you do me a favour
Don't be slipping blud I will take ya
Don't be sleeping blud I will wake ya
Then send you straight to your maker
Cause wanna get a flight back to Jamaica
Yeah, I'm a tight writer, punching out lines just like a typewriter
Don't feel you cos you're not my type of writer
Thinking you're heavy but really you're lighter
You're shit plus, furthermore you're a writer
Without your friend you ain't really a fighter
You're just shitting in the diaper
That's why man don't lay you down with the sighter
Gonna send for the younger, the likkle bike rider
Send him on a mission, give him a score, 'diva
Tell him to lick shots, to use a diver
Let’s see who comes out a survivor
Young baby father, still a provider
P's in the pocket and everything's lighter
To put a couple shells inside ya
Du du du du dont let me get old school
Just like a builder me carry those tools
Like a sport without no rules
Mandem are running without no balls
And man are getting injured kicked in the balls
You and your team haven't got no balls
You're a pussyo blood you ain't got no balls
Swimming in the deepest end of the pool
Get compp in the deepest end of the tool if you fuck around with the mandem you'll fall
Just like the twin towers you'll fall
Me got the most towers overall
Man will send your head-top over the wall if you try fuck around with the Dirtee Stank
I'l come around with a dirty shank
Ready for the war like 30 tanks (I'm ready)
I'm chilling in the alley, holding a leng on my lap and I'm ready to put on the bally, no dilly dally
You'll be a memory like Camdem pally
I don't care if you come with a couple man (I dont care)
I don't care if you come with ya gyally (I don't care)
Cos I'm still gonna pull out the strally (Yeah)
And that's just to make an impression
I'm going to give your whole crew depression
The war's not done, this is the first session
I'm a big man I'm no adolescent
So I'm gonna show man and teach man a lesson
Turn this into a western
With a Smith & Wesson glove
There's no print on the weapon, love
Get none of that round this section
That Street Fighter 4
What you think they call man the street fighter for?
Man a be stepping like the gears of the war
And we got mashed like the gears of the war
Think it's a game like Street Fighter 4
What you think they call man the street fighter for?
Man a be stepping like the gears of the war
And we got mashed like gears of the war
It smells a bit warry
Dont watch that cos I'm in the war to
Ready to kick off a world war too
With the generals behind ready fi da war too
Too warry
Don't watch that cos I'm in the war to
Ready to kick off a world war too
With the generals behind ready fi da war too
It smells a bit warry blood
Heard you wanna bore me blood
What happened when you saw me blood
It was a whole different story blood
You didn't wanna war, you ignored me blood
What happened to the plans you had for me blood
All this talk about boring
You're gonna be the one that's pourin' blood
Do you really wanna see it get, gory blood
Ive heard all these different storys blood
Its too late for sorry, get found in the back of a lorry
So allow the tool show it ain't morry
You can't hold me back from glory blood
If I was you I'd worry, I'l make you move somewhere down surrey
And I'm just generally speaking, close your mouth when the general is speaking
Don't let me catch the enemy when he sleeping, take everything everything I'm keeping
All of your food and P I'm eating, you get left with your head-top leaking
Before you can get to the leng you are reaching for, man a kick out the door
Into a whip that nobody saw
I got your P Leng and goodies
Man overly blacked out in hoodies
And we're parked up smoking zoogies
Thinking "Could he survive that, could he?"
Nah, we're just having a laugh
Lets split this ting and a get my half
Everyone gets P's or my stuff
Super dupe OOOH OOOH
Dirtee t, thats me me
Budebutbut lyrical Super dupe OOOH OOOH
Dirtee t, that's me me
