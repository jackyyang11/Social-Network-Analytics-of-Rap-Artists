[Hook: D Double E]
If you, think you
Can come against I, I
Then lyrics will fly like birds in the sky
Hit one of your bredrins in the eye
Next time think twice before you try
And come against me

[Refrain: D Double E]
It's me

[Hook: D Double E]
If you, think you
Can come against I, I
Then lyrics will fly like birds in the sky
Hit one of your bredrins in the eye
Next time think twice before you try
And come against me
If you, think you
Can come against I, I
Then lyrics will fly like birds in the sky
Hit one of your bredrins in the eye
Next time think twice before you try
And come against me

[Pre-Verse: D Double E]
I bet, if you try the chat on mine
You be left to die
Why? Cos I'm an evil guy
Take it that there's no reason why I
Should have to lie
Lyrical supply inside your hi-fi
Nasty Crew da-bu-duh side by side
We're 'bout to fly high like birds in the sky

[Verse 1: D Double E]
I bet
If you step to me you'd get wet
Because you know I don't ramp or pet
I'll make you regret that we ever met
And I'll give you a memory you won't forget
On your forehead, there's bare sweat
I'll leave you stressed out, might need a cigarette
The doctor won't know
So you bet, your only get away is jet
I bet
If you try to chat on my set
You will get caught in a net
Cause you're messing with the lyrically vet
You'll be left in debt with your whole house to let (let)
Put you in order, do the alphabet
I'll show the ropes like an army cadet
And I'll let you get who you wanna get
Cos I got more links than the internet

[Hook: D Double E]
If you, think you
Can come against I, I
Then lyrics will fly like birds in the sky
Hit one of your bredrins in the eye
Next time think twice before you try
And come against me
If you, think you
Can come against I, I
Then lyrics will fly like birds in the sky
Hit one of your bredrins in the eye
Next time think twice before you try
And come against me

[Verse 2: D Double E]
If you try to chat on mine
You'll be left with a big fat fine
Next time I see you on the frontline
You're gonna be mine
He better resign quick-time
And you better not waste time
Cos I'll make sure your little yute won't see age nine
Gotta draw the line
And if you do it again I'll end your lifeline
I b-e-t
Try to chat on my s-e-t
You'll get caught in a n-e-t
Messing with the lyrically v-e-t
That D-E-E
D Double E strip away an icey 'n' I see
By the way you move, you like me
You can't see the view that I see
The view that I see is too pricey

[Hook: D Double E]
If you, think you
Can come against I, I
Then lyrics will fly like birds in the sky
Hit one of your bredrins in the eye
Next time think twice before you try
And come against me
If you, think you
Can come against I, I
Then lyrics will fly like birds in the sky
Hit one of your bredrins in the eye
Next time think twice before you try
And come against me

[Verse 3: D Double E]
Shake the earth, spit my verse
Leave a curse, make MCs rehearse
Reimburse their verse
Or look forward to the worst, reverse
Not gonna stop 'til we come first
And I know it hurts to know we're gonna burst
And you'll get left in a hearse
Zipped up in a bag just like purse
No need for a nurse
You got nailed
Tried to get locked up but your plan failed
Cause you got bailed
That night your car got tailed
Never knew my heat was so loud
Six to the whip, gunpowder cloud
I can see you were hit from the gunpowder cloud
In seconds, you'll be surrounded by the crowd

[Refrain: D Double E]
Eurgh eurgh, it's me
Eurgh eurgh

[Hook: D Double E]
If you, think you
Can come against I, I
Then lyrics will fly like birds in the sky
Hit one of your bredrins in the eye
Next time think twice before you try
And come against me
If you, think you
Can come against I, I
Then lyrics will fly like birds in the sky
Hit one of your bredrins in the eye
Next time think twice before you try
And come against me

[Outro: D Double E]
Eurgh eurgh, it's me
Eurgh eurgh
