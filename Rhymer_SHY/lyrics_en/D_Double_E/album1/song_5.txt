[Verse 1: D Double E]
Lyrical Incredible Hulk
I get money and I get it in bulk
Make a MC go home and sulk
Them man can't show me the ropes
Cuh nah, them man can't show me the ropes
Them man there on a slippery slope
Them man there must think it's a joke
Them man are snorting too much coke
Cuh you can put me to the test
Blood, there's no contest
Which soundboy wanna test?
Right now, blud, I don't care less
You can make a bird call to the nest
I got man that wanna invest
I got labels showing interest
Can you smell that lemon zest?
If you see me with an empress
You better check out the bum and breast
Yeah, let's go home and rest
Let's quickly undress
Yeah everyting cool and bless
In life, man have to progress
I want more success
I want more success, cuh

[Chorus: D Double E]
I'm better than the rest
Nah, none of these men can't test
I'm putting in more, not less
Yeah, you can hold this to the chest
I don't care what your pump on your chest
'Cause I'll pump this in your chest (bluku)
Straight through your bulletproof vest (bluku)
You can be my guest (bluku)

[Verse 2: Wiley]
I'm the best MC
North, south, east to the west MC
Skillwise big up my chest MC
Big up Lady Leshurr, big up your breast MC
Like who's gonna test MC?
I tell my dons go fetch MC
Don't leave until you catch MC
I'm no basic but I am a next MC
No FaceTime, ring up or text MC
Man are OG, I know how to flex MC
Look into my face and read my lips clearly
I'm telling you, I am the best MC
I'm not a Drake, or a Wayne
Or a Jay-Z, or a Kanye West MC
I'm a cheese lemon zest MC
Dallas, Falcon Crest MC

[Chorus: D Double E]
I'm better than the rest
Nah, none of these men can't test
I'm putting in more, not less
Yeah, you can hold this to the chest
I don't care what your pump on your chest
'Cause I'll pump this in your chest (bluku)
Straight through your bulletproof vest (bluku)
You can be my guest (bluku)

[Verse 3: D Double E]
I'm that lyrical arsonist
Them boy there ain't even half of this
Lyrical title, yeah, they're after this
I don't know what them men are on
I don't know what them man are thinking
I will bun them like cherry bomb
Cuh us man are here still proving a lot
Them men are losing the plot
Feel the fire blazing, blazing
No hold back, no energy saving
Sizzling like steak in the pan
D Double E and his right hand man
Keeping it overly real, cuh we can
Stick with the plan, stick with the program
And if I like your gyally
Wham, bam, thank you, maam

[Chorus: D Double E]
I'm better than the rest
Nah, none of these men can't test
I'm putting in more, not less
Yeah, you can hold this to the chest
I don't care what your pump on your chest
'Cause I'll pump this in your chest (bluku)
Straight through your bulletproof vest (bluku)
You can be my guest (bluku)
