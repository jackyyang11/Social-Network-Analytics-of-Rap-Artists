[Intro]
Yeah G. You know what I be doing, straight rolling on niggas. You can’t tek man for no eediat. So what we telling them? (Check) Bluku Music!

[Chorus]
A wah di bludclart, a wah di rahtid
Could’ve been main road, Could’ve been market
My mandem will bark it bark it
Make you shit your pants and fart it fart it
Never skylark it
You get swept straight under the carpet
As for your whip, better mind where you park it (Skrrr)

[Verse: 1]
If it's that, it's that
Don’t think I'm a pratt
Man will come with the longest strap like rat-a-tat-tat, like rat-a-tat-tat
Like one for the waistcoat, one for the hat
One for the leg, then back to the hat
It's gonna go down like that, it's gonna go down like that

[Verse: 2]
I'll turn your snapback into a visor
Should’ve been smarter, shoud've been wiser
You're not dinner, you're just an appetiser
You don’t wanna get caught up in a cypher
You don’t wanna get caught up in a tangle
Head will get mangled and it will dangle
Started the fire off, lighted the candle
This is how big business get handled

[Chorus:]
(Bud A Bu Bu) A wah di bludclart, a wah di rahtid
Could’ve been main road, Could’ve been market
My mandem will bark it bark it
Make you shit your pants and fart it fart it
Never skylark it
You get swept straight under the carpet
As for your whip, better mind where you park it (Skrrr Skrrr)

[Verse: 3]
Its me D Double
Don’t wanna come across me d double
Don’t wanna double cross me d double
Don’t wanna buck up with me d double
Cause if you buck up then you gonna see trouble
Better buckle up and (?) from double
Or see me in your own blood puddle
Show no love when you get no cuddle
Man wanna try bread double
Buy me a drink and make it a double
Certain MC's wanna be my double but only my yute can be my double
My double, my double
Don’t worry my son say nada
Respect the older, respect the farda
Or you'll link up with karma
Come with the armour
Come with the llama
Fully loaded blud check the banana
Them man gonna get found by a farmer
Body might just surface on the harbour
If you don’t hold it down be calmer
On top of this like Obama
Them man are hiding like Osama
Don't bother say that I never warned ya

[Chorus:]
(Bud A Bu Bu) A wah di bludclart, a wah di rahtid
Could’ve been main road, Could’ve been market
My mandem will bark it bark it
Make you shit your pants and fart it fart it
Never skylark it
You get swept straight under the carpet
As for your whip, better mind where you park it (Skrrr Skrrr)

[Verse: 4]
(Bud A Bu Bu) Tell man shush
Hide out, bill a zoot of the kush
With the leng yeah I will hide in the bush
Leave man a tick on the face like swoosh
Them man are acting stush
On the train track I will give man a push
Got bare arms like octopus
Them man better shut their mouth
Them man better shut their mush
I don’t wanna hear one sound
D double E, FG's in town
(?) on your wing, they holding it down
Don’t want none of this, hold it down
And I'm holding my ground
Open shop and ill close it down (ooh oooh)

[Chorus:]
(Bud A Bu Bu) A wah di bludclart, a wah di rahtid
Could’ve been main road, Could’ve been market
My mandem will bark it bark it
Make you shit your pants and fart it fart it
Never (?) it
You get swept straight under the carpet
As for your whip, better mind where you park it (Skrrr Skrrr)

[Verse: 5]
If it's that, it's that
Don’t think I'm a pratt
Man will come with the longest strap like rat-a-tat-tat, like rat-a-tat-tat
Like one for the waistcoat, one for the hat
One for the leg, then back to the hat
It's gonna go down like that, it's gonna go down like that
