Seven in the evening grabbed the phone and started calling
All my friends coz its saturday night
I got this funky feelin' before i start on leavin' that tonight i'll meet the man of my life

Pre chorus:
Give me time so i can think about
All those days that we have to go away
If you feel a little insecure
Come with me baby i will be your cure

Chorus 2x:
Bounce come turn it up
Bounce to the music
Come shake it up
Bounce until you drop
Ain't nobody gonna stop me

I got this party movin'
Everybody start on groovin'
I feel the sound coz i know your around
You can scream if you want to
Jump around if it makes you
Feel alright while you dance through the night

Repeat pre chorus
Repeat chorus
