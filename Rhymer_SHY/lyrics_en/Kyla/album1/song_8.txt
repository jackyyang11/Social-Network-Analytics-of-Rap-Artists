Saying goodbye
Is never an easy thing
But you never said
That you'd stay forever
So if you must go
Darling I'll set you free
But I know in time
That we'll be together
Ohhh
I won't try to stop you now from leaving
Cuz in my heart I know
Love will lead you back
Someday I just know that
Love will lead you back to my arms
Where you belong
Sure
Sure as stars are shining
One day you will find me again
It won't be long
One of these days
Our love will lead you back

One of these nights
We'll I'll hear your voice again
Your gonna say
How much u miss me
You'll walk out this door
But someday you'll walk back in
Darling I know I know this will be
Sometimes it takes
To find ur way back
Love will lead back
Someday I just no that
Love will lead u back to my arms where u belong
Sure
Sure as stars are shining
One day u will find me again
It won't be long
One of these days our love will lead you back

But I won't try to stop u now from leaving
Coz in my heart I know
Love will lead u back
Someday I no that
Love will lead u back to my arms
Where u belong
Sure
Sure as starts are shining
One day u will find me again
It won't be long
One of these days our
Love will lead u back

Repeat chorus
