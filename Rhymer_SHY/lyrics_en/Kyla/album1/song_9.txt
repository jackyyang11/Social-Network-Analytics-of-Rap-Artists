Only brokenhearted, lifes not over
I can start again
While Im lonely, brokenhearted
Its a hurting, thing to get over
Im young but Im wise enough to know
That you dont fall in love overnight
Thats why I thought if I took my time
That everything in love would be right
Oh, oh
But as soon as I closed my eyes
I was saying to love "good-bye"

Chorus:
But I guess Im only... brokenhearted
Lifes not over I can start again
While Im lonely brokenhearted
Its a hurting thing to get over
No more empty conversations
Next time I will be totally sure, oh
Dont want the pain of falling in and out of love
Its more than my poor heart should endure

Bridge:
So Ill listen to all advice
And remember each time I cry
Chorus
Da, da, da, da, da-ha whoa..
Bridge
Chorus
Think about you all the time

Bridge 2:
Never thought Id be alone again
Thats why I asked you to be my best friend
You know youre always on my mind
Think about you all the time
You know what Im saying?
Oh baby
Bridge 2
