If ever you wonder if you touched my soul
Yes, you do..
Since I met you, I'm not the same
You bring life to everything I do
Just the way you say hello
With one touch I can't let go
Never thought I'd fall in love with you

*Because of you, my life has changed
Thank you for the love & the joy you bring
Because of you, I feel no shame
I'll tell the world
It's because of you

Sometimes I get lonely
And all I gotta do is think of you
You've captured something inside of me
You make all of my dreams come true
It's not enough that you love me for me
You reached inside & touched me eternally
"I love you" best explains
How I feel for you
(repeat * )

My life has changed
Thank you for the love & the joy you bring
Because of you, I feel no shame
I'll tell the world
It's because of you

The magic in your eyes
True love, I can't deny
When you hold me, I just lose control
I want you to know
That I'm never letting go
You mean so much to me, I want the world to see
It's because of you.....
(repeat * except last line)
(repeat *)
You..you....
