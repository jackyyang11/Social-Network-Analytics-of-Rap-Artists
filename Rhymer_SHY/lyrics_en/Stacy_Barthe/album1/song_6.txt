Trying to quit you
Is equivalent
To an addict with an addiction
To the strongest drug
Couldn't get enough
Irresistible, oh my, gluttony for love
It's self destructive in a way
'Cuz though you're bad for me
The thought of starting over's so scary

And it's oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Easier said than done
And it's oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Easier said than done

Silly of me
To think that you
Could ever love me the way I love you
You don't have the heart
Some people aren't fit to play the part
But there's something so contagious about you
'Cuz when you kiss me you're so convincing
Even though I know

That it's oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Easier said than done
Said it's oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Easier said than one

Sometimes I think you love me
Sometimes you be pretending
It beats me being lonely
How i hate all those idol, silent nights
Woah

Said it's oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Easier said than done
And it's oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Easier said than done
Said it's oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Easier said than one
