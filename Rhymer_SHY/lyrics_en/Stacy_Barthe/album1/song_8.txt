Oh
I was just a girl, you were just a boy
Together we were one
Together we were perfect
Talk about in sync
You know what I'm thinking
Before I could even think it, get out my head
I was just a girl, and you were just a boy
Two ordinary people
Made extraordinary love
Extraordinary love
I was just a girl, you were just a boy
Two ordinary people
Two ordinary people
Made extraordinary love
Extraordinary love
Extraordinary love
Extraordinary love
Made extraordinary love
Extraordinary love
I was just a girl, you were just a boy
Two ordinary people
Two ordinary people
Made extraordinary love
Extraordinary love
Extraordinary love
Extraordinary love
Made extraordinary love
Extraordinary love
I was just a girl, you were just a boy
Two ordinary people
Two ordinary people
Made extraordinary love
Extraordinary love
Extraordinary love
Extraordinary love
