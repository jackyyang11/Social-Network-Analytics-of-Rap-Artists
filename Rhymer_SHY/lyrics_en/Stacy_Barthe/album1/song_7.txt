[Intro:]
Oooooohh...aaaayyy

[Verse 1:]
We're rambling at this point
So I'm having to back down, so I give up
You got it you got it you got it
I think we've both had enough
Either that or it's to a point I think we both said enough

[Chorus:]
Well...enough is enough uhhhh
Enough is enough, enough is enough uhhhh
Enough is enough, enough is enough uh uhh uuhhhhh
Enough is enough, uhh uhh yea

[Verse 2:]
Where do we go from this point?
How do you expect to move on?
Words that fly like bullets do
And You shot me down you shot me down dude
It's showing you shot me down
You shot me down dude

[Chorus]
