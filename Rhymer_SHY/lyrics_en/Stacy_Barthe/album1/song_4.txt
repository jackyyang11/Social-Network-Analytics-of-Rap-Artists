There's just a hint of light
Peeking through my blinds
And it hurts my eyes so I deep engulfed
Ever since his recent departure
I have no re desire to be out
In the world, all alone, yeah

It's just one of those days
When I just want to linger in my comedown
One of those days when I just wanna be when no one's around
I'll rather just be alone
I'll rather just be alone
In my comfy little coffin, comfy little coffin, comfy little coffin
I'll rather just be alone
In my comfy little coffin, yeah, oho
Comfy little coffin

It's like my spirit fled
And all that's left of me is a bag of bones, bag of bones
And I ask myself, will I ever find my strength to ever
Love again
Cause it kinda feels like the end

It's just one of those days
When I just want to linger in my comedown
One of those days when I just wanna be when no one's around
I'll rather just be alone
I'll rather just be alone
In my comfy little coffin, comfy little coffin, comfy little coffin
I'll rather just be alone, all alone
In my comfy little coffin, yeah, oho
In my comfy little coffin
I, comfy little coffin
Comfy little, comfy little
I'll rather just be alone
I'll rather just be alone
In my comfy little coffin, comfy little coffin, comfy little coffin
In my comfy little coffin
I'll rather just be alone, whoa
In my comfy little coffin, whoa, whoa
Comfy little coffin
I'll rather just be alone
I'll rather just be alone
In my comfy little coffin, comfy little coffin
In my comfy little coffin
I'll rather just be alone
