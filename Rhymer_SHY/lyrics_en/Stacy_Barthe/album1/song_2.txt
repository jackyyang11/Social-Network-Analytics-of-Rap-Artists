I don't know about most things
But I know a few things
About being broken
Ive cried too
And for so long I didn't know the root of my pain
Lied inside of me [right inside of me]
I got good old memories good old times
But that was then and this is now
I got bad old memories bad old times
But that was then and this is now
This is me now and that was me then
Dont hold me accountable this is me now
That was me then this is me now
Before I knew me that was me then
This is me now
I know how it feels to be stranded
Waiting on the side of the road
No one driving down and I dont want to compromise
I know what it feels like
To be overlooked and took for granted
One good thing about pain
It never last
I got good old memories good old times
But that was then and this is now
I got bad old memories bad old times
But that was then and this is now
This is me now and that was me then
Dont hold me accountable this is me now
That was me then this is me now
Before I knew me that was me then
This is me now
