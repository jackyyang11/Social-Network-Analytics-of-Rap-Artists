[Verse 1: Stacy Barthe]
If I could, I'd gave you the world
I'd wrap it all around you
I won't be satisfied with just
A piece of this heart
My angel
You're my angel
You're my angel
You're my angel

[Verse 2: John Legend]
Oh, dreams are dreams
Some dreams come true
I found the real dream
Baby, when I found you
You're so strong but tender too
You're my angel
Oh, angel
You're my angel
Oh, angel

[Bridge: Stacy & John]
Whoa, whoa,...
(you are my... ooh)

[Verse 3: Stacy & John]
Oh, I love the way we touch
I love the way it feels
Everytime you're near me, my heart just won't keep still
No doubt about it that this love I feel is real
My angel
Oh angel
You're my angel
Oh angel

[Outro]
No, baby don't go now baby
No, baby don't go
No, baby don't go now baby
Oh my...you're my
(you're my, you're my)
Cause you're my angel
Whoa
My angel
You're my angel
Oh angel
My angel
Yea...I know you are listening
