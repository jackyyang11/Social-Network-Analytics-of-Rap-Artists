[Talking; Stacy]
"I know, it's not what it look like, I'm good
Like I'm just, you know tired yeah call me, later for sure.."


[Verse 1: Stacy Barthe]
Lying here still, Like a corpse, on an autopsy bed
Cause of death she confessed in the letter
She wrote and left it on the dresser, it was wine
It was fine lines, idle time
Silent nights they took over my mind, took over my mind


[Pre-Chorus:]
What do I do in the mean time, what do I do do do
What do I do when I need you now, I need you now
What do I do when I can't erupt, blindness from your love
What do I do when my best friend becomes the rim of this bottle


[Chorus:]
Drink my pain away, drink my pain away
Drink my pain away from the rim of this bottle
Drink my pain away, drink my pain away
Drink my pain away from the rim of this bottle


[Talking]
"No, I think I just go home
No I just don't' feel like myself
I know I just
Maybe I need a little space cause you
Making me feel like, you just making me feel like.."


[Verse 2: Stacy]
Maybe I should kill myself slit my wrist and end
All of this, picture yourself depressed standing over my coffin
Kill me a second time, drowning me in all the tears
That you cry, but it's too late to say good bye


[Pre-Chorus:]


[Chorus:]

[Stacey:] "Hi, my name is Stacey and I've been sober for about a hmm...
Week and a half but, I'm doing good though I don't I don't feel the urge."
[Joi:] Hi, My name is Joi I don't know why I'm here but I guess 'cause

[Stacey:] "Wow! good!"
[Joi:] "Guess I'm doing ok, I'm doing alright"
[Matumba:] "Hey Hey hello, my name is Matumba and they tell me I have a
Drinking problem but everyone sees it but me I, I just I like to drink?"
