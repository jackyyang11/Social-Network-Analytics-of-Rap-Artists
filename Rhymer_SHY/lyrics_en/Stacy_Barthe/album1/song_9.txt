[Verse 1]
Nobody knows all my trouble
Nobody knows I've got a [?]
I spend most my time daydreaming 'bout what it could be
But I've been miles and miles from my reality
Cause what it could it just ain't right now
And where I should be I just ain't right now
I can't even tell you how I'm gonna get there
Or who's still gonna be there
I'm walking around here with my...

[Chorus]
Eyes wide shut
Cause the world is just too scary to face sometimes
I just don't know
I just don't know
And so I keep my eyes wide shut
Cause the world is just too scary to face sometimes
I just don't know
I just don't know

[Verse 2]
And then this life gets so difficult
I'm trying hard to keep head above water
It's the [?] you're stressing over it
And all the things you've got no control of
Start to wonder, if the storms are ever gonna let up
Start to wonder if god can really hear me, yeah
Or am I not praying loud enough?

[Chorus]
And I keep my eyes wide shut
Cause the world is just too scary to face sometimes
I just don't know
I just don't know
And so I keep my eyes wide shut
Cause the world is just too scary to face sometimes
I just don't know
I just don't know

[Outro]
Nobody knows my troubles
Nobody knows my struggle
Nobody knows my troubles
Nobody knows my struggle
They just don't know, they just don't know
They just don't know, they just don't know
