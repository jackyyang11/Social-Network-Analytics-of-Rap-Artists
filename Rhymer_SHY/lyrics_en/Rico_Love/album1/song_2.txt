[Hook]
Now it all seems like a blur all the things we saw and heard
At least for me it was a first
Do you remember that night in Amsterdam?
Do you remember that night in Amsterdam?
Maybe you were too gone, maybe I was gone too
I know I was on you and I didn't even want to land
Do you remember that night in Amsterdam?
Cause I remember clearly

[Verse 1]
So hard to describe the energy
You had to be there, you had to feel it for yourself
Walking through the static of the aromatics, started from the bottom made it to the attic
Hoping I don’t leave up out this bitch an addict, halfway to the plane and we still going at it, damn
And you was so sexy cursing out taxi drivers
And you was so public, you was like fuck it, let me ride it
So I did and you did, you had that man getting big
Wishing I can take you back to where I live, thought about you all the way back to the crib

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
All those smoky rooms filled with tiny dancers
All those voices calling my name but I ain't tryna answers
And when you lay down on me, I couldn't help but stand
Had me all at attention, lost in this wonderland
I was so in tune, didn't notice anyone else that was in the room
Made a small shower, so all the wallflowers didn't have any other choose but to bloom
Each moment run to the other, saw the beauty in every colour
Me and you standing in the light, then you was like, let me get a light

[Hook]
