[Verse 1]
I am drifting
A hundred million thoughts spent on the wrong thing
No connection
A hundred million miles the wrong direction

[Pre-Chorus]
Endless stars and endless space
The arrows are pointing all over the place
I'm an aeronaut, navigation lost
Trekking through the universe
Never thought that I would be the one to give up first
Ya, I must confess here's my SOS

[Chorus]
I know that you're my constant
Even if I lost it
I'm chasing after you like a Com Pom Pom Pom Pass (compass)

[Verse 2]
I have done this
Terra formed my own sense of what truth is
Like a black hole
Crushing everything inside this black soul

[Pre-Chorus]
Endless stars and endless space
The arrows are pointing all over the place
I'm an aeronaut, navigation lost
Trekking through the universe
Never thought that I would be the one to give up first
Ya, I must confess here's my SOS

[Chorus]
I know that you're my constant
Even if I lost it
I'm chasing after you like a Com Pom Pom Pom Pass
(compass)

[Bridge: Manwell Reyes]
Never been this lost before
Gotta find my way back back track some more
Witta back pack strapped to my back for sho
There's no lookin' back track through the black for gold
And see I know I come equipped witta GPS
To see thee quest my heart crying SOS
I hate my mess but still man I must confess
I can't digress I'm chasing to see what's next YAAAH
Staring at my life like a map - UH
Tryna figure out where you at - UH
Siri can you tell me how to get
To the point where my future meets his best and I tell you that's real


[Pre-Chorus]
Endless stars and endless space
The arrows are pointing all over the place
I'm an aeronaut, navigation lost
Trekking through the universe
Never thought that I would be the one to give up first
Ya, I must confess here's my SOS

Ett, två, tre, fyra (1, 2, 3, 4)

[Chorus]
I know that you're my constant
Even if I lost it
I'm chasing after you like a Com Pom Pom Pom Pass
(compass)
