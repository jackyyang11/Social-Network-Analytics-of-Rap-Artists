Architecture (david Thulin Remix)
There are a million mountains that I'd like to climb
To get a glimpse of the heart of your design
So here I stand, here I stand on what You build
You are surrounding me and the walls will never, ever, ever come down

You build me up like a city of gold
The battles rage but I'm standing tall
You formed my heart like an empire
The wind and rain can't stop this fire

If only I could see it from Your perspective
The beauty and the grace of Your architecture

There are a million trees blowing in the wind
Witness of lives already led
So here I stand, here I stand on what You build
You are surrounding me and the walls will never, ever, ever come down

You build me up like a city of gold
The battles rage but I'm standing tall
You formed my heart like an empire
The wind and rain can't stop this fire

If only I could see it from Your perspective
The beauty and the grace of Your architecture

Of Your architecture
Your architecture
Your architecture
Your architecture

Here I stand, here I stand on what You build
You are surrounding me
Here I stand, here I stand on what You build
You are surrounding me
Here I stand, here I stand on what You build
You are surrounding me and the walls will never, ever, ever come down
No, the walls will never, ever, ever come down

You build me up like a city of gold
The battles rage but I'm standing tall
You formed my heart like an empire
The wind and rain can't stop this fire

If only I could see it from Your perspective
The beauty and the grace of Your architecture

Your architecture
Your architecture
Your architecture
Your architecture
