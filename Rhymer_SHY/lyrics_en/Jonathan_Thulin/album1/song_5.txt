I've found myself awake inside a dream
A dream that seems to give me everything
I won't be satisfied until it's here
'Cause I was taught to push for what I feel[?]

I've built a bent immunity to truth
I'm blinded by the sight of this world's proof
But tell me when I reach this point of view
Will I have lost track of You?

So I fall on my knees
Begging You to save me
I have been gone for far too long
So now I'm coming
I am coming back home

There seems to be a lack of effort here
I pretend to try to reach you but I give in
To the built-up aggravation of my loss
Till I've forgotten the beauty of my cost

So I fall on my knees
Begging You to save me
I have been gone for far too long
So now I'm coming
I am coming back home

I'm trying to find a way out of this mess
Come bring me out of the haze
There is no more reason to cry
'Cause You have given me a way to be alive
A way to be alive

So I fall on my knees
Begging You to save me (yeah)
I have been gone for far too long (yeah)
So now I'm coming
I am coming back home
(oh yeah)
