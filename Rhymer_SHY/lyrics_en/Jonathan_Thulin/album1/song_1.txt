(VERSE 1)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
I, don't even know where to begin
These walls, that I built are wearing thin

(Pre-chorus)
I'm lost now more than ever
Tryina keep it all together
Wonderin' if you see my heart breakin'
This was never what I wanted
Tryna finish what I started
But my purpose feels like it's fading

(Chorus)
I'm hangin by a thread, yeah I'm 6 feet under
Tryna be bright but my light is covered
Only you can turn my ember to a flame
I'm stuck in the dark, cause I'm 6 feet under
Tryna see the sun,  but my eyes are covered
Only you can make the darkness go away
I'm 6 feet under (2 times)

(Verse 2)
Night
As far as my eyes can see
I'm alive
But not really living

(Pre-chorus)

(Chorus)

(Bridge)
I know with you I'm alive (9 times)

(Chorus)

I know with you I'm alive (3 times)
