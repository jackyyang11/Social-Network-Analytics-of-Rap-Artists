The bombs have dropped and they're falling on my face
Fire and glow will be fading out soon
'cause my conscience broke and my heart's out of tune
Bombs away, bombs away to my heart, to my heart
Bombs away, bombs away to my heart, to my heart
Bombs away
The devil came knocking at the door of my dreams
I knew it was wrong, but my mind felt so free
Now I won't stop till it's done, no, I won't stop till it's done. Bombs away, bombs away to my heart, to my heart
Bombs away, bombs away to my heart, to my heart
Bombs away
Rather left me and myself, is exploding me
Fire is clinging on me as I'm running out
So here I am, here I am
Like the fools, 'cause my heart's gonna blow
Bombs away, bombs away to my heart, to my heart
Bombs away, bombs away to my heart, to my heart
Bombs away
