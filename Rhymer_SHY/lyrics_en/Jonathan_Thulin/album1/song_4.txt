We paint our colors to get close to You
Paint it black and blue
But we don't get through
'Cause You wanted different colors from the start
Placed it in our heart
Wrote it on the wall

We mean well 'till we bleed
We are troubled indeed

Because our hearts are in Babylon
Our will is strong
But the truth is a killer
And as we speak with the tongues of men
You will descend
And down will come Babylon

We cross our fingers for prosperity
I, myself, and me
Where's our dignity?
We shake our fists at all the bad that is
When the problem is
We're the cause of it

We need to march, march, march
'Till the walls come down
Watch it fall like snow
Just like Jericho
