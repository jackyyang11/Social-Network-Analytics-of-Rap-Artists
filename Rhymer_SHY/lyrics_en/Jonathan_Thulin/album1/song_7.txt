The air is cold tonight
There's gun powder in my eyes
This is the eve of battle, yes
I left my other life behind, all I can see is the front line
This is the eve of battle
Is this real? This cause I’m fighting for
Am I real? I don’t know anymore
What do I stand for?
Am I left, am I right, am I up and down?
Am I east, am I west, do I wear the crown?
Is my creed worth dying for?
What do I live for?
Can you tell in my face what my heart beats for?
Do the words that I speak show it to the core?
Does my glow outshine the stars? Can you see my coat of arms?
Can you see my coat of arms?
The drummer boy’s getting ready, I’m trying to keep my hand steady
This is the dawn of battle, yes
I’ve never been this afraid, forgot my family and my name
This is the dawn of battle
Is this real? This cause I’m fighting for?
Am I real? I don’t know anymore
What do I stand for?
Am I left, am I right, am I up and down?
Am I east, am I west, do I wear the crown?
Is my creed worth dying for?
What do I live for?
Can you tell in my face what my heart beats for?
Do the words that I speak show it to the core?
Does my glow outshine the stars? Can you see my coat of arms?
Can you see my coat of arms?
Every second counts as the clock ticks back and forth
Time is running out, tell me, do you know for sure
Who you are, ‘cause you only have one life to live
You only have one life to live
What do I stand for?
Am I left, am I right, am I up and down?
Am I east, am I west, do I wear the crown?
Is my creed worth dying for?
What do I live for?
Can you tell in my face what my heart beats for?
Do the words that I speak show it to the core?
Does my glow outshine the stars? Can you see my coat of arms?
Can you see my coat of arms?
