[Verse 1]
Run, run, run as fast as you can
There’s a big bad wolf and he’s coming your way
Cry wolf, cry wolf
Lie, lie, lie ‘till you’re blue in the face
Their attention’s yours, 15 minutes of fame
Cry wolf, cry wolf

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s an empty trade but you do it well
You’ve got everyone fooled by the lies you tell

[Chorus]
It’s a tangled web that you’re weaving now
All the seeds you’ve sown will come back somehow
When the danger is real
No one will appear
‘Cause who can believe
The boy who cried wolf
Who cried wolf
Who cried wolf
Who cried wolf

[Verse 2]
Cry, cry, cry ‘cause they're listening now
Give the performance of your life then take your bow
Cry wolf, cry wolf

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s an empty trade but you do it well
You’ve got everyone fooled by the lies you tell

[Chorus]
It’s a tangled web that you’re weaving now
All the seeds you’ve sown will come back somehow
When the danger is real
No one will appear
‘Cause who can believe
The boy who cried wolf
Who cried wolf
Who cried wolf
Who cried wolf

[Bridge]
Caught up in the hysteria
Everything that you want and more
It’s gonna fall, fall down
One day when you are alone
All you'll have left is what you've done
What you’ve done
Caught up in the hysteria
Everything that you want and more
It’s gonna fall, fall down
One day when you are alone
All you'll have left is what you've done
What you’ve done

[Chorus]
It’s a tangled web that you’re weaving now
All the seeds you’ve sown will come back somehow
When the danger is real
No one will appear
‘Cause who can believe
The boy who cried wolf
Who cried wolf
Who cried wolf
Who cried wolf
Who cried wolf
Who cried wolf
Who cried wolf

[Outro]
You swear that the wolf is coming through
When the truth is that the wolf is you
