There are a million mountains that I’d like to climb
To get a glimpse at the heart of your design
So here I stand, here stand on what you build
You are surrounding me and the walls will never, ever ever come down
You build me up like a city of gold
The battles rage but I’m standing tall
You formed my heart like an empire
The wind and rain can’t stop this fire
If only I could see it from your perspective
The beauty and the grace of your architecture
Oh
There are a million trees blowing in the wind
Witnesses of lives already lived
So here I stand here stand on what you build
You are surrounding me and the walls will never, ever ever come down
You build me up like a city of gold
The battles rage but I’m standing tall
You formed my heart like an empire
The wind and rain can’t stop this fire
If only I could see it from your perspective
The beauty and the grace of your architecture
Oh
Your architecture (4x)
Here I stand, here stand on what you build You are surrounding me (3x)
And the walls will never ever ever come down
No, the walls will never ever ever come down
You build me up like a city of gold
The battles rage but I’m standing tall
You formed my heart like an empire
The wind and rain can’t stop this fire
If only I could see it from your perspective
The beauty and the grace of your architecture
Oh
Your architecture (4x)
