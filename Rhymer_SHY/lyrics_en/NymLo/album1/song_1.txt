The dope dealers had with the sweats and sneakers that match
As I look around I see niggas eatin' from rap
Then I start to think, I don't need to be in the trap
But then I watch the money, I need to be in the trap

And if he fuck it up then you make him bleed for the pack
Then you cut him off, you tell him leave and don't come back
But the game need you my nigga [?]
Cause these other niggas rhymin', my nigga, you speakin' facts
Like if you ain't gon' kill him then don't be reachin' for that

Sup, it's Melony
I didn't wanna do this over the phone
But you haven't been answering none of my calls, neither returning them
And we need to sit down and have a talk because I'm pregnant
