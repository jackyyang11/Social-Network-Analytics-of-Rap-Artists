[Verse 1]
The good girls are gone now, that leaves me with you
Don't talk 'bout the drugs now, unless they on you
Will you fuck on the comedown, wake up on the news?
Gotta hope that you come soon, might check out at noon

[Pre-Chorus]
We kill the uppers and we save our high
I'm saving up for a lifetime supply, yeah
I'm blindfolded baby, girl, please close your eyes
You won't be able to endure this night at times

[Chorus]
Bondage, when I'm tied up with you
Ain't it ironic that I'm bonded to you?
Trying to be honest, this mixed drink will tell truth
I like bondage when I'm tied up with you, yeah

[Verse 2]
I can't feel the love now without feeling pain
Come through in the black boots, put sex on my brain
I like being locked up, just throw me the keys
I like how you pop up, leave me on my knees

[Pre-Chorus]
We kill the uppers and we save our high
I'm saving up for a lifetime supply, yeah
I'm blindfolded baby, girl, please close your eyes
You won't be able to endure this night at times

[Chorus]
Bondage, when I'm tied up with you
Ain't it ironic that I'm bonded to you?
Trying to be honest, this mixed drink will tell truth
I like bondage when I'm tied up with you, yeah

[Bridge]
Bondage, bondage
Bondage, bondage

[Chorus]
I like bondage when I'm tied up with you
Ain't it ironic that I'm bonded to you?
Trying to be honest, this mixed drink will tell truth
I like bondage when I'm tied up with you, yeah

[Outro]
Bondage, bondage
Grind it, grind it
Honest, honest
Bondage, bondage
