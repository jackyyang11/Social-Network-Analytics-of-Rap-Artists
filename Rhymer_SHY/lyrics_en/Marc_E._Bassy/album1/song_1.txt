[Hook]
I'm drinking Forty water
Bands in my pockets
I'm just a rebel baby
Don't know what the cause is
I been floating for days now
Going through this process
Stay with the ones that stayed down
Best I cut my loses

[Verse 1]
All black, all black, all black, I got all black on
Blocka, blocka, knock it down all night until the morning come
Baby, I'm a writer, I got stories in my living room
This ain't overnight, I been like this since the delivery room
You know the love you looking for is tainted
Every day is brand new like the bay bridge
I swore that there was nothing that could break us
But look at what you do to just get famous

[Hook]
I'm drinking Forty water
Bands in my pockets
I'm just a rebel baby
Don't know what the cause is
I been floating for days now
Going through this process
Stay with the ones that stayed down
Best I cut my loses

[Verse 2]
Yeah, all black, all black, all black, she got all black on
Woke up feeling freaky, called me to her condominium
Stepped out on the balcony, she told me she was cooking good
Cigarettes and coffee, yeah, that's breakfast in East Hollywood
Your greatest fear in life, is that you're basic
You say I don't go out, but girl you stay lit
You say that you're just so damn spiritual
Saying, "Father can you hear me now?"

I'm drinking Forty water
Bands in my pockets
I'm just a rebel baby
Don't know what the cause is
I been floating for days now
Going through this process
Stay with the ones that stayed down
