[Verse 1]
Lean back with the foot on the wall, it's too nasty
This coke cost too much, and my voice sounds raspy
Too many cigarettes and whiskey when I'm in NY
Feel like it's the world against me, walking in Bed-Stuy
Walking with my chick, is these people all Jamaican?
Get a glass of sea moss, two eggs, a side of bacon
Eugene tell me go see a show, some hardcore band
Seven dollar cab ride, pull up beside a tour van
That shit was yankin' and we try to find some cocaine
Strike out though, I hear somebody calling my name
It's the rest of the posse, we debate about the new Kendrick
Sharing some interest, homie say he never saw that perspective
Back in some dive shit, nasty free pizza, with the beer and shot
First approach of the night, "Uh, do you come here a lot?"
Right, this shit's busted anyway
Coke connect came through, gotta hit the ATM to pay

[Chorus]
Call me up off the liquor
Say that you want me
Call me up off the liquor
Say that you want me
Sometimes I need to catch myself, catch myself
Sometimes I need to catch myself, catch myself

[Verse 2]
Okay, take it, it's in the right pocket of that peacoat
Hit the star, come out blabbing like I'm on a key note
Music biz, gossip bitches, all in a cypher
I wish New York was tighter, what if we lived here as a minor
I mean my momma grew up out in Brooklyn and she told me stories
Graffiti painted walls and brown bags covering 40's
Was the normal city scape, nothing on your dinner plate
We scrape by, now we exit off the interstate

[Chorus]
Call me up off the liquor
Say that you want me
Call me up off the liquor
Say that you want me
Sometimes I need to catch myself, catch myself
Sometimes I need to catch myself, catch myself

[Bridge]
You make it different
Everywhere we go, it's not the same thing
I got my ticket
Funny how you only sip when I was away
You can call me

[Chorus]
Call me up off the liquor
Say that you want me
Call me up off the liquor
Say that you want me
Sometimes I need to catch myself, catch myself
Sometimes I need to catch myself, catch myself
