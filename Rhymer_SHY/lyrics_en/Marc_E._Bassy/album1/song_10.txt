[Verse 1]
Money, weed, and liquor
That ain't gon' change us now
Time to deliver
It is what it is right now
Time (?) moving on
Help me get the crib right now
Hoes if you choosing on
That ain't gonna change us

[Chorus]
I change the game for her
Change the game for her
Change the game for you, yeah
I change the game for her
Change the game for her
Change the game for you
I change the game for her
Change the game for her
Change the game for you, yeah
I change the game for you
Don't play no games with you

And I stop fucking all these hoes I've been fucking
You better stop waiting for the next man to put you on
And I stop drinking like I ain't got nothing coming
You better stop thinking that I'm gonna do you wrong

I change the game for her
Change the game for her
Change the game for you, yeah
I change the game for her
Change the game for her
Change the game for you, yeah
I change the game for her
Change the game for her
Change the game for you, yeah
Don't play no games with you, yeah
Just tell me when I get through

[Verse 2]
I've been hot lately
Ain't that some shit
Shit that I would speak into existence exists
Sorry for the need to say this
Sorry for the need to say this
Imma be a good fucking father
Leave a couple million for my daughter
We gon' have a beautiful mansion
Do it better than our parents
Get old, drinking liquor on the Tes'
You ain't' gon' expect it
When I propose
I'm pissed over breakfast
Listening to Davis
Before he went electric
Yea that's your pop's music
And what I share with you, lover, I put thought to it, yeah
I curate every sex scene like it was a wet dream
Girl I be flexing, yeah
You don't never see me texting no hoes
Girl, I be exing, oh no

[Chorus]
I change the game for her
Change the game for her
Change the game for you, yeah
I change the game for her
Change the game for her
Change the game for you, yeah
I change the game for her
Change the game for her
Change the game for you, yeah
Don't play no games with you, yeah
Just tell me when I get through
