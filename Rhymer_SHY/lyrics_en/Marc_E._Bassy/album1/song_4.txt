[Intro]
Shit
Hey, Hello

[Verse]
Under the influence of a whole lot of reefer
A half a bag of pure shit I tell her that I need her
A common denial rappers getting busy
A soft of a  piano Alicia Keys got sweezy
I know you feel it shoutout to all the poets
Bouncers at strip clubs bitches working that pole
Shit it
Looks so easy I can see the makeup you put on
Formulate your future baby [?] a song
Little darling growing twenties all my ladies making money
They don't just throw you one's
I got sufficient funds
I throw a hundred and my man put it in his fly
It ain't tricky when you spending money on your family ties
Hosted clubs, centerfolds give me deja vu
Paper at the cloud nine and a canabo
Comics at Al Capones
[?]
Cognac sippin outside them broken homes
Golden Eagle motel
Fake Chanel and Louis
Oakland rappers with two bitches grew up listening to Duey
And blow that oowee
Outside like it's legal
It practically is we should've skylined with the seagulls
Soon as I hit Broadway
After a long day
A girl [?]
And it's about foreplay
[?]
I kick back with a blunt or two
My undivided team and now they grew up in 2002
The 415, 510, all the rest of 'em
I'm singing with the band but I'm rapping with the best of 'em
This ain't no bible but it sure is an Old Testament
Streets with hookers, pimps, and tourist, drug dealers, entrepreneurs
Blacks and whites and mexicans and asians

[Outro]
Everybody out here tonight
You know?
And they all got jobs
All like the [?] fight
Birds of feather and we all getting loose tonight
