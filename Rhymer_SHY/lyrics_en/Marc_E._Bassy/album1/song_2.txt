[Verse 1]
Four in the morning, it's good
Yeah that's midnight to me
That stuff, let them do what they could
That shit nothing to me
Soon as it was understood
That shit changed on the dime, ayy
I did it, I did it, I did it
I couldn't waste any more time
Yeah, baby you coming with me
Shit happened so quick
You said loving was free, baby
But I had to be rich
Live in a house in the hills, baby
With something on my wrist
I did it, I did it, I did it
I couldn't resist

[Chorus]
I put that money first
But you know I wanted you to work
I put that money first
But you know I wanted us to work
I wanted love to work

[Verse 2]
It's cuffing season
Yeah that's my off season
I am Mr Solo, Dolo
White tee with the Polo
My shoes Undefeated
My necklace is gleaming
Just took a walk up the street
Had to get flight for the weekend
Just so they know I mean it

[Bridge]
If I just open my mind
And I told you my secrets
Would you have my back like spine
Or would you stab me like Caesar
Should I say I would never leave ya
Or should I do like Aretha, get my R-E-S-P-E-C-T
Or put love first like I'm Mother Teresa
That got me drinking more Moesha
That got me rolling Khalifa

[Chorus]
I put that money first
But you know I wanted you to work
I put that money first
But you know I wanted us to work
I wanted love to work
