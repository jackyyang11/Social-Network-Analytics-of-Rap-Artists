[Intro]
Although you spent all of twenty-seven years, acquiring this house, this furniture, this position. Although you spent forty years raising this child, these children. Nothing, none of it belongs to you

[Verse 1]
I steal and rob
I killed my brother just to take his job
I took his wife and made her children starve
I'm all pollution, forcing down my own religion
Only cook that's in my kitchen, I ain't gon' listen to y'all
Fuck would I do that for?
I'm a man, I'm a beast, trying to make a two year-old
Trying to make the whole damn city know my name
And when we get the house on top, this gon' be the same

[Pre-Chorus]
American dream, yeah
Park it in the private lot
Tell me I'm doing too much
But you know you don't want me to stop
I could sell it all away
Everybody here raised on C.R.E.A.M
Cash rules everything around me, that's American scheme

[Chorus]
I want some, I want some
American dream life
I want some, I want some
Is it what it seem like?
I want some, I want some of that
American dream life
I want some, I want some
Aww, yeah
American scheme
I want some, I want some
American dream
I want some, I want some
American dream life
I want some, I want some of that
American dream life
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
The courtroom was mobbed
They came to watch the judge go sentence me off
I said, "your Honor, yeah I stand before God"
I take the blessings and the the curses
For the better or the worses
They still want to judge and clutch on the cross
Mmmm, fuck would they do that for?
It's all natural baby, getting high in the studio
Trying to make a whole damn city sing my songs
But man you get there, you gon' break some balls
And now baby we on
Mhmmm, party in the parking lot
Handle to the face, my arm on her waist
No, she ain't gon' tell me stop
This ain't the life we chose, it's the one we seen
And this about as good as it gets in American dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
American dream, yeah
Park it in the private lot
Tell me I'm doing too much
But you know you don't want me to stop
I could sell it all away
Everybody here raised on C.R.E.A.M
Cash rules everything around me, that's American scheme

[Chorus]
I want some, I want some
American dream life
I want some, I want some
Is it what it seem like?
I want some, I want some of that
American dream life
I want some, I want some
Aww, yeah
American scheme
I want some, I want some
American dream
I want some, I want some
American dream life
I want some, I want some of that
American dream life
Yeah, yeah

[Outro]
The owners of this country know the truth. It's called "American dream" because you have to be asleep to believe it
