[Verse 1]
Mama used to pick me up in a black Jeep
Turn me to the countryside from the city streets
And my daddy wasn't doing well, he wasn't doing well
He tell me, "Go inside and say farewell, go and say farewell"

[Pre-Chorus]
And pull over, let me out
Let me jump in the backseat, put the windows down

[Chorus]
We got a black Jeep to get us over
We got a black Jeep for starting over
We got a black Jeep, it's four wheel drive
We got a black Jeep, we'll still survive

[Verse 2]
Then I went and hit the road like a track meet
And pull over when outside, yeah, I would sleep in the backseat
Yeah, I'm heading for the borderline, gonna be a star
So I can shine a little light up to where you are

[Pre-Chorus]
And pull over, let me out
Let me jump in the backseat, put the windows down

[Chorus]
We got a black Jeep to get us over
We got a black Jeep for starting over
We got a black Jeep, it's four wheel drive
We got a black Jeep, we'll still survive
