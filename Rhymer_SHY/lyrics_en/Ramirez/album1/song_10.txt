[Verse 1: Ramirez]
Bitch you know this score is murder
When I'm crossing through your fucking hood
Bullies with them pulleys, making em'
The set is still up to no good
Bring the pump
Leaving the body inside of the trunk
Your body get slumped
Mangle the body and leave it in chunks
Slow to the flow, roll up the skunk
Comin' out the Westside, jumping out the whip
With a full clip then I let it bust
With a deadly touch
Get em buck as fuck
Don't get stuck by the devil's son
Cursed and burned by the flames
This ain't an arrange
I'm bringing the pain
Looked in the brain
I don't give a fuck
Hanging myself then cutting the vein

[Hook]

Come get this, big business, motherfucker be a witness
(He was once a thug, he was)

[Verse 2: Shakewell]
It's a stick-up
My chopper do the hiccup
Pull up with the cuete five pints in the pick-up
Long Haired Dragon with
The Silver Back Gorilla
Keystone the Prince
Down south of North Califa
Ain't shit changed walking round
With my teaser
Homies keep they thang cholo tryna get they visa
Swiper no swiping
Mastercard or them Visas
Time to get slammed
Fuckboy it's the season
