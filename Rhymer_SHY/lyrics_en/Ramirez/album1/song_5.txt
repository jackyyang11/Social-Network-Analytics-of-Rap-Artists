[Verse]
Posted at the front just sipping up on the Alizé
Bad bitches running and grindin' peepin' the baller mane
Gold things and gold chain and gold rings
Meet coach and tell him, shoot some Cartier frames
Two steps 'cause players don't really dance so
Break a nigga back by checkin' dice on them dominoes
Makin' money 'cause money is what I comprehend
Sailor Moon I see you choose that in front your man
Breaking hearts and locking lips I don't understand
Bro became the rookie and sip all over this double can
Lock up at the crib and don't be ringing the phone
Getting lucid after hitting my partners while in the stove
Gettin' the reds as the ropes this study is switchin' them lanes
Feelin' like I'm Tony Montana with diamonds on my chain
Come and lounge at the players club, come get a back rub
Feet up countin' money, see these stacks, bruh?
Pockets filled with nothing but blues, I'm dropping checks
Bring a bottle of your finest champagne, that's to the neck
