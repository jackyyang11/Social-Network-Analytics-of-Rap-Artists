[Verse 1: RAMIREZ]
Manifest my powers, recognize that I'm that Antichrist
Walk amongst the walking dead, you fuck with me then pay the price
Castin' of the demonic spells, I rouse up from the devils flame
Standin' tight in pentagram that demons rise and take your name
Creepin' out the darkness all you see is fucking bloody walls
Triple Six is what they’re chanting, sacrificing bustas off
Standing in a circle as we're praying to the wicked one
Flames arise, a buster cries and everybody starts to run
Lucifer I pray to you, I'm searching for my evil ways
Come and get these offer rings and take their souls into your cave
Standin' in the corner, white line looking down to black abyss
Voices in my head, telling me kill this motherfucker like this
I grip my blade, I'm gripping tight, aiming for the suckas neck
Everybody in my head, I don't know what to listen to next
I aim for his neck, then its over with
I hear the Triple Six chant, it's in the back like this
Triple Six, Triple Six, Triple Six
