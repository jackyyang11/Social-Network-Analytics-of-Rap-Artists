[Hook]
Whip full of kush cup full of codeine pop a little xan
Got me floating like a dream
Got me floating like a dream
Whip full of kush cup full of codeine pop a little xan
Got me floating like a dream
Whip full of kush cup full of codeine pop a little xan
Got me floating like a dream
Whip full of kush cup full of codeine pop a little xan
Got me floating like a dream
Whip full of kush cup full of codeine pop a little xan
Got me floating like a dream

[Verse 1]
Smoking on the bud
Take a zip from the mud
Got me feeling less the drugs
[?] from my nuts
Banging swinging paper chasin
Trying to make my ends meet
Shaking hands and kissing babies
Take the presidential sweet
Rolling up the indo
Say what's up to six four
[?] to the barbeques and talking to some kin folks
Bitches they be trippin cus I haven't called them in a minute
Look em in the eyes and tell them it's a money making mission
This ain't no privilege
I pay up my dues
Them suckers be hating
They say i'm too rude
Fuck em I duck em
They nothing I'm something
My [?]
Them boys cannot touch it

Got me floating like a dream
Got me floating like a dream
