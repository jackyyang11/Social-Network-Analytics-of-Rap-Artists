[Verse 1]
Walk through the dark in the night with an axe
Swing it one time, put a nigga on his back
Stay locked out with the .40 Glock strap
As I creep through the dark
Boy you step in the trap
Welcome to the dungeon
Bodies burning
People screaming, and I’m looking for the plague
I don't give a fuck what the haters will say
All of them pussies won't say it to my face
I lost my mind when the devil stepped inside my room
Handful of pills that I would consume
Just on the scene fresh out the cocoon
Embodied by evil possessed by the demons
I fell from the heavens not looking for light
Bothered by shadows
I'm filling the room with the drugs that I take
As I empty my soul into the night
