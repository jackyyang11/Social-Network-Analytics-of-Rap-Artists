[Verse 1]
Fuck a [?]
I can do this by myself
I don't need no damn
I don't need no fucking help
Bitch I'm a beast
I am [?] outta hell
You do it for the paper
I'm doing it for the wealth
I'm fucking the game up
And motherfucker that is why haters
Dre found out what [?]
Running with the guys [?]
I'm just in your corners
I'm out of your favors
[?]
[?] trapping at a very young age
Running circles trying to get paid
Working my [?] in many ways
Putting money in my socks
Running from the fucking cops
Boy the block is fucking hot
All these niggas getting shot

[Hook]
Ruthless I did my time don't need [?] my plate
I'm hungry and I'll take this motherfucker
You better watch your place
Creeping bout to kill best believe no one is safe
Empty up the clip and bring another murder case
Ruthless I did my time don't need [?] my plate
I'm hungry and I'll take this motherfucker
You better watch your place
Creeping bout to kill best believe no one is safe
Empty up the clip and bring another murder case
