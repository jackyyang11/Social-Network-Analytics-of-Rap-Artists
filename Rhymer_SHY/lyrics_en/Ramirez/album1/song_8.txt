[Hook]
I need dough, I need cash
I need guala, I need racks
I need cheese, I need green
I need money I'm a fiend
I count chips, I flip bricks
I fuck your bitch in my whip
Flick the wrist, cook the shit
Niggas know I stay equipped

[Verse 1]
Chopping blades up in that Cadillac
Dropping off some more macs
Smoking on the fat sack
Little killers out so watch your back
There's blood all on the ceiling
But the bodies laying on the floor
Fiending for a massacre
Triple six is in this hoe

[Hook]
I need dough, I need cash
I need guala, I need racks
I need cheese, I need green
I need money I'm a fiend
I count chips, I flip bricks
I fuck your bitch in my whip
Flick the wrist, cook the shit
Niggas know I stay equipped

[Verse 2]
I said fall off
These niggas don't know I smoke too much
I need a cough drop
I pull up with the fucking cannon
Grab the sawed-off
I need that loot inside my hand
I'll take your top off
I call my cousin then I tell him
At the drop off
You fake thugging all on Twitter
Youse a knock off

[Hook]
I need dough, I need cash
I need guala, I need racks
I need cheese, I need green
I need money I'm a fiend
I count chips, I flip bricks
I fuck your bitch in my whip
Flick the wrist, cook the shit
Niggas know I stay equipped
