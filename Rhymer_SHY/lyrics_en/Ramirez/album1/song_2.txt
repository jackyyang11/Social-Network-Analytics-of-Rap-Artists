[Verse: Ramirez]
Whippin the grain inside the caddy
Doing my thang upon the fucking floor
Hitting em with that one-two step
And then I rob this nigga hoe
Sliding? by my chain
You see the diamond pinky ring and stones
That's dancing in my mouth
Shining like they been hit by the rain
I'm ruthless
I'm heartless
Straight out of the fucking coffin
Gorilla the killa
The pimp that's always flossing
Bending corners in that escalade
Loving pussy staying paid
Swerving through the interstate
The money always calling mane
Pull up to the liquor store
To get some woods and sip a four
Run-up to the barbecue to shoot these dice
And play cee-lo
Bumping classics smoking magic
Never worry bout no static
Pussy boy this automatic
Bitch you want it you can have it
Swanging with them elbows
Peanut butter jelly coke
Candy paint be dripping
So you know that bitch fresh off that hoe
Popping trunk and banging screw
Trunking two's say whatta do
Parking pimping macking women
Thought you knew that I'm a fool
