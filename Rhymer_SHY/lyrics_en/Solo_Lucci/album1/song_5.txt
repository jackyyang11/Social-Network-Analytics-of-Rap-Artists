[Bridge]
I used to stand in the kitchen
And whip it and whip it and chop it and flip it
I used to hit up my 'migo
He'd drop out them bricks and I drift through the city
I might be young but I'm getting it my nigga
The riches, my bitches sadity
You know I see it, I want it, I buy it
I own it cause, bitch, I'mma spend it

[Hook]
Spent 200 on a coupe, that’s quarter ticket on a foreign car
Got a hundred thousand dollars worth of shoe
Spent five hundred, hundreds on an Audemar
In the club, twenty bands on you
Cause we don’t buy bottles bitch, we buy the bar
And all my niggas gon' shoot
So I don’t need a motherfucking bodyguard

[Bridge]

[Verse 1]
Young nigga driving through the city
Got a new whip painted two tone
Came up straight out the trap with a bentley
Llike hard bread, call it crouton
Young nigga you sleep on the floor
Now the King Size came from a futon
Nigga I don’t do the [?] paper like coupon
Got big bankrolls and you ain't doing nothing
Big bankrolls got me coming to the hundreds
Usain Bolt, I'm running to the hundreds
Running to the hundreds, running to the hundreds
I been told "nigga get your bread right"
Say they fuck with me, I'm like "yeah right"
Walk on upon it, these niggas don't want it
When I get to bussin', now all I see tail lights
I used to stand in the kitchen
And I was in the trench like every night
I used to whip it and whip it, doing everything to get my bread right
I was just cooking and dipping it, serve today, get it head right
Addicted to money, I did want the hunnits and hunnits and hunnits and hunnits

[Bridge + Hook + Bridge]

[Verse 2]
I fuck with them killers, don't fuck with no pussy
I’m ballin' like starters, you ballin' like rookies
You niggas can't fuck with me, you niggas know it
I spit this shit, it just sound like a poem
You spit your shit, it just sounds like you wrote it
I read it, they quote it, then put it on Twitter
Bitch I got more whips than a slave owner, nigga
Pull up on them SKKRT, SKKRT, SKKRT, SKKRT

[Bridge + Hook + Bridge]
