[Choros]
Bitch I be Saucin
On that cash money shit
Cause' I'm big bossing
Killing these niggas you can put em' in a coffin
Gucci on my toes I feel like I'm moonwalkin
I've been bumping [?] on my sneakers loud
Feel like turk cause I've been juggin since a juvinile
[?] I'm baby I got all these diamonds in my mouth
Whip got no ceiling like [?] you know what I'm bout
That cash money shit
