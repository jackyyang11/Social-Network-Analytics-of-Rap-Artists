[Verse 1: Nick Grant]
Uh, forever a queen
Pure, black and ever so clean
When shit get hot
You help me watch for what these devils could bring
Responsible nightmares and having Federal dreams
And being grounded can bring you closer to heavenly things
I learn from you
I want you to teach me to love you
The missing piece to the puzzle
Single parent hustle
I feel stupid, thought  cupid's arrows too dull to cut through
Sweet Sadie you gimme sugar
Place none above you
That cocoa butter on your skin took the G outta me
Wanna be with a king
Coretta must be your kin
Gotta be color blind
You can't see you're a gem?
Before I break the family branch
I go out on a limb
I love your eyes
The way you stare, I love your heart
How you provide for whomever's there
I promise I got you, you never had to lie
How could I fault you for this?
You like the closest thing to God
Still we call you a bitch
Black woman

[Verse 2: Nick Grant]
Uh, thanking God for your presence
You gifted, girl you a blessing
Since these women are ours, lets cherish them every second
Times get harder
That's why your heart darker than Florida Evans
Simply precious, my muse
My beautiful imperfection
Mother nature gave me life that's how they best describe it
The light of my life
But still we are forever blinded
They turn around, exploit your physicals and televise 'em
We more concerned with diamonds and rhymes about who the flyest
Here's my lecture to recognize the timeless
Why do they hate her?
From Nina Simone, to Angela Davis
Hung up my jersey from modern-day playa
Know a single woman, who struggles
Working double, but still
Could never do her no favors
Know a single woman
Who fucking ball players for paper
Training the adolescent mind as celebrator
If no you, there is no me
How could I fault you for this?
You like the closest thing to God
Still we call you a bitch
Black woman

[Verse 3: Nick Grant]
Uh, I swear your hair is like the thickest cotton pickens
Headed for temptations, but that's not an option listed
And as I browse your mind I'm learning that your optimistic
Could probably vision us together but that's not realistic
I heard rumors twice over and they sound horrific
But I knows better
Searching for your mouth to kiss in
And when I pray I tell my God that you're his best invention
And when I'm done touching your mind here's my next intention
A blessing isn't it?
A stand up nigga
Never poured me a four up
She wants the real me
And I ain't hesitate when I showed her
This ain't checkers its chess
Start our journey through flesh
Who the fuck are they kidding?
You nurtured men through your breast
I bet he's awesome protection
You point the finger at fault
Was handed nothing, you vanishing
I can't stomach the thought
I couldn't manage to be here
The pain would damage my walk
My feet are tired, you embody
Everything I admire, my black woman
