[Intro: Nick Grant]
Yeah
This is from my heart

[Verse 1: Nick Grant]
They called the black boy stupid and the white boy loved it
White boy corporate, black boy hustling
White boys are honest, black boys, you shouldn't trust 'em
White boy got his wish, black boys, they give us nothing
Black boy got it hard, white boy think he god
White boy got nigga jokes but that's where the line is drawn
Ha-ha-ha, white boy snitch, black boy ain't involved
Black boy live in the ghetto, white boy live a façade
Black boy rapper, him got swagger and his chain hang
White boy love his kids and faithful to his main thing
Black boy baby mama, meaning he got lady drama
White boy slave owner, does that mean he hate Obama?
Black boy Kevin Hart, white boy Will Ferrell
Black boy love hip hop, white boy heavy metal
Black boy built pyramid, damn I feel special
White boy don't believe black boy was once pharaoh
Stereotypes

[Hook]
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
Cause this life's so hard and the world's so cold, my dear
And we got so far to go, and we got so far to go
Where do we go from here?

[Verse 2: Nick Grant]
They called the black girl ghetto and the white girl loved it
Black girl a fighter, white girl changes the subject
Black girl need a hug, white girl need a thug
White girl got a black boy, now she's one of us
Black girl golddiggin', let's see how far it get you
Black girl just for me, white girl Paul Mitchell
White girl up and leave, she split and take half
Black girl is all you need, don't care 'bout your past
White girl kills her husband when he sleeps to himself
Black girl calls me white cause I articulate well
White girl submissive, black girl vindictive
White girls are spoiled, black girls handle their business
Black girl drug addict, white girl prom queen
Stereotypes exist, racism behind the scenes
White girl daddy sayin', "leave them niggers alone"
Black girl dancin' to that "need a rich nigga" song
Should I continue on?

[Hook]
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
Cause this life's so hard and the world's so cold, my dear
And we got so far to go, and we got so far to go
Where do we go from here?

[Bridge: Nick Grant]
All I want to say is that, they don't really care about us
All I want to say is that, they don't really care about us
All I want to say is that, they don't really care about us
All I want to say is that, they don't really care about us

[Hook]
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
Cause this life's so hard and the world's so cold, my dear
And we got so far to go, and we got so far to go
Where do we go from here?
