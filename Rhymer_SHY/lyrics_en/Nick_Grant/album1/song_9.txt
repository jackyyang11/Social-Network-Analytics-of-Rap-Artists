[Verse 1: Nick Grant]
Uh...
Somebody tell them niggas that I'm legendary
We gon' check 'em first, like the secretary
Leap the competition
Twenty-ninth of February
This double M is all I need
I think I'm Meth & Mary
Bouncin'
I peel off like a dead nigga'
Shooter do it himself
Boy he Blair Witchin'
Blood spillin' over beef
I'm a rare nigga
And we don't run from nothin'
'less the feds with ya'
How you want it?
This that '96 Pac
Never met a nah notha nigga this hot
Pen game dope, scribble 'til my wrist lock
Niggas ballin' thinkin' shit is sweet
Chris Bosh
Boy, bouncin'
You gotta catch those lines
Tell a broke nigga
Hold up that "depressed hoe" sign
She want dick and I'ma nail it
Not the press on kind
Baby girl throw it back
Like it's West Coast time
And get it...

[Hook: Nick Grant]
Hot damn...
It ain't 'bout the money
Boy, the shit ain't in the plans
Girl I got a bag on me
Money dancin'
And when you real nigga
Everybody understand
Hot damn nigga...
I can make the money nigga...
I can make the money nigga...
With the top down
Tell them other niggas
They can't do what I can

[Verse 2: Nick Grant]
Food for the soul
Real nigga' ingredient
Never was a hater
Nigga' that shit look too tedious (haha)
Come through wavy and they gon' do you the greasiest
Kids slide up on you
Like pajamas with the feet in 'em
Strong minded, she ain't messin' with no weak nigga
My biggest fear is that you treatin' me like theeese niggas'
Got a P.H.D., and she like the weed lit up
Ass fat, she don't waste much
Like a cheap nigga'
Bouncin'
My outfit scream murderer (whoo)
Yeah I'm showing out, roll the curtains up
Baby blue Jordan 9
Think I should hit Gerber up
Going harder than Laura lettin' Urkle fuck
I thought I told you that it's all about the moola
Know I keep that thing
Like when Lauryn dropped Doo Wop
Tell them niggas' cool out
'Fore they hear that booyah
Party animal It's like when Meech brought the zoo out
Bouncin'

[Hook: Nick Grant]
Hot damn...
It ain't 'bout the money
Boy, the shit ain't in the plans
Girl I got a bag on me
Money dancin'
And when you real nigga
Everybody understand
Hot damn nigga...
I can make the money nigga...
I can make the money nigga...
With the top down
Tell them other niggas
They can't do what I can
Hot damn...
It ain't 'bout the money
Boy, the shit ain't in the plans
Girl I got a bag on me
Money dancin'
And when you real nigga
Everybody understand
Hot damn nigga...
I can make the money nigga...
I can make the money nigga...
With the top down
Tell them other niggas
They can't do what I can
