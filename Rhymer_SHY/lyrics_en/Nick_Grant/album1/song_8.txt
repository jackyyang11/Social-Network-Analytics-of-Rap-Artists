[Intro]
La ladi ladi la

[Hook:]
I wake up, and get in my bag
I count up my cash
I pray up my soul (my soul)
Then go and get more (more yeah)
I wake up, and get in my bag (my bag)
My bitches so bad
I hit it soon as I, soon as I
I wake up, and get in my bag
I count up my cash
I pray up my soul (my soul)
Then go and get more (more yeah)
I wake up, get right in my bag
I dream about racks
I gotta get it as soon as I wake up
I wake up

[Verse 1: Nick Grant]
You done fell in love with the bad guy
Tell em I ain't nothing like your last guy
Feeling like Harden with the stash spot
Hit her like Ricky with the backshots (Ricky!)
Looking for a way out, so you know I bought a crib way out
You know a young nigga bout the dough boy
I'm so real when I let the Tre out
Yeah, put that on gang, better yet, let me put you on game
The way this little bitch take D, I call that shit stealing my slang
Fuckboy, I'm still in my bag
A nigga can't stop flipping this cash
Got the glow and the pimping in my genes
If it's it, then I'm all on the ass
Bout the green like Jimmy with the mask
Pulling off and I gotta do the dash
Still you only getting money for the cab
Mike Jack' moonwalk for a bag

[Hook:]
I wake up, and get in my bag
I count up my cash
I pray up my soul (my soul)
Then go and get more (more yeah)

My bitches so bad
I hit it soon as I, soon as I
I wake up, and get in my bag
I count up my cash
I pray up my soul (my soul)
Then go and get more (more yeah)
I wake up, get right in my bag
I dream about racks
I gotta get it as soon as I wake up

[Verse 2: Nick Grant]
Tell me why my ex keep blowing me
Swear a nigga momma used to warn me
I'mma make the killing, get the coroner
Like its prime time on the corner
Fucking with the plug, we connected
You know I blew cheese how I'm dressing
How they got the white-white jumping out the pot
Somebody need to go an talk to Wesley
All my niggas is the realest, all you niggas in your feelings
Cop a feel, I hit the ceiling
Oh, there's been a disappearance
Oh, you wish you had this willpower, getting jiggy with it with it
I'm that nigga, who ain't the realest, shit I'm offended
Tint on the window, bitch mind your business
She gon' shake ass, she gon' bounce them titties (yeah hoe!)
That pussy roud as a golden penny
And these niggas tell on they co-defendants
Catch you slipping while you on the move
Sorry, I might need a quote from Menace
Eyes popping out the coupe nigga
I'm coming strong as a bowl of spinach
Never ever waste time, when you devoted just go and get it
Wait

[Hook:]
I wake up, and get in my bag
I count up my cash
I pray up my soul (my soul)
Then go and get more (more yeah)
I wake up, and get in my bag (my bag)
My bitches so bad
I hit it soon as I, soon as I
I wake up, and get in my bag

I pray up my soul (my soul)
Then go and get more (more yeah)
I wake up, get right in my bag
I dream about racks
I gotta get it as soon as I wake up
