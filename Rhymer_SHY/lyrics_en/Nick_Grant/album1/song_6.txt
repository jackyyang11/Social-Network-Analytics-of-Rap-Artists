[Verse 1: Nick Grant]
Check, uh
I got a thing for Benzes throttle engines
Hottest lenses, watches, and Taraji Henson
Fuck the fame, cause the game brings phony friendships
My homie was the co-defendant
I had more to lose
We hit a lick, he spent it all on shoes
Now he need a lawyer and he calling who?
What’s a boy to do?
A southern nigga with these up north flows
Got more hoes than my childhood wardrobe
A lot of the times niggas lie in they rhymes
In order to live forever you got to die in your prime
Too broke for white folk
Too rich to be in the mix
That's life though
Walking this tightrope
Put your hands on mine
You know the outcome
Cash long like Johnny dropped a double album
Balcony seats
Play the cut
Suit cut to a crease
Smoother than her ex man
Peep the mystique
All I got is my word and my two genitals
I fuck her good make her reach her pinnacle
This for the niggas who, sneak dissing who
Probably on more lean than smooth criminal
Shucking and jiving streets glorifying jiggaboos
When he ain’t making what you make he feel miserable
Black Sinatra

[Hook]
Big bills
Big Deal, not enough
Got a lot, still ain’t got enough
You can have the game when we done with it
People say I change
Cause I got black cards, black truck, black driver
That’s us
Black tux at the opera
Money and fame, they come with more problems
Outlive that, Black Sinatra

[Verse 2: Nick Grant]
It took a nigga like JG to put me on
The rap phenom
Who else would he put the cream on?
The last nigga slept though
Need it up front
Quiet as kept though
I’m like Marshawn Lynch with strep throat
[?]
You need a team to win, tell Mello recruit the skill
Never sold dope but if I had the money from doing
I wouldn’t need a deal, still I am under influence
Call me Pablo set the bar high check the repertoire
Never trust a chick with leopard print she a cheater
Here is the epilogue, I like broads that like broads
Classy, never use the N-word in white cars
You tripping if I ain’t the hottest, fuck being modest
I’ll probably make Rakim and Daddy Kane the proudest
She in the crib looking at the walls like you ain’t got no plaques
That’s cause those other niggas ruined rap
Who is that, gangster living dangerous, where bodies pile up
The male Badu, fuck her make her witch her style up
Got a pool filled with Jessica Albas we wild bra
You niggas hand shakes ain’t matching your smiles bra
And that’s the way of life, make it and pay the price
Pick a nigga like me, to show your daddy raised you right
Nicky blue eyes, know I flow miracles
Nobodies, somebody get rid of you

[Hook]
Big bills, [?]
Got a lot, still ain’t got enough
You can have the game when we done with it
People say I change, cause I got black cards, black truck, black driver
That’s us, black tux at the opera
Money and fame they come with more problems
Outlive that, Black Sinatra
