[Verse 1]
Fat cribs, security at the gate
No neighborhood, it's lonely on my estate
Hardly do the flashy part in me for keeping [?]
Whip game proper, they know it's me by the plates
Dame D.O.L.L.A., check my blue collar
Earned it, every purchase is for certain, getting wilder
Stakes are lil' bloody and my momma getting prouder
And at the family functions, man that smoke just getting louder
The value of a dollar quickly change
Still don't do the strip club, but love the finer things
Even when I cop myself a flooded diamond chain
I hate to say I'm different, bruh,  but I ain't the same
I buy a flight the same day I leave, I think I'm losing it
I'll quit when I go pro, if I keep up with the foolishness
It ain't the stuff I do
It's the number of people I do it with
Swear I got control, but be moving like a lunatic

[Chorus]
I'm a boss, I got all these chicks on me
Only 26, – uh, call me "big homie"
Millions at my fingertips
Gold on the rollie
So Ginuwine, they want to ride the pony
I'm a boss, I got all these chicks on me
Only 26, – uh, call me "big homie"
Millions at my fingertips
Gold on the rollie
Soldier you whine, they want to ride the pony

[Verse 2]
Everywhere I go they recognize me, even women (they do)
Promise I don't drop my name or look for no attention (never)
Been a chick magnet before I signed for my extension (before I signed)
They be dimes, but I like my girls with more than one dimension
DM overloaded, half gone expose it
If she ain't a dime a dozen, she can't get a dozen roses
I hate a party pooper, but I love 'em when I'm focused
Don't ever play me like a sucker, spare me the commotion
I get a lil social when I'm tipsy, cup yo chick you
Know that money talk
I come around and here to lick her
Hands all on my shoulder, coochie guilty on my fit (she)
Know that I'm from Oakland, so I'm too legit to quit
If you all in my section, you part of my collection
[?] BFF, I laugh, correction
Say she wouldn't have to lie if I was so affection
I break it off and let her know that these are my confessions
You feel?

[Chorus]
I'm a boss, I got all these chicks on me
Only 26, – uh, call me "big homie"
Millions at my fingertips
Gold on the rollie
Soldier you whine, they want to ride the pony
I'm a boss, I got all these chicks on me
Only 26, – uh, call me "big homie"
Millions at my fingertips
Gold on the rollie
Soldier you whine, they want to ride the pony

[Verse 3]
Get it from my dad, boy, I promise I'm a G
If I ever fall then I land on my feet
Pray for all my peers, I know I'm a dyin' breed
And if I lose it all, I know I'ma die in peace
Get it from my dad, boy, I promise I'm a G
If I ever fall then I land on my feet
Pray for all my peers, I know I'm a dyin' breed
And if I lose it all, I know I'ma die in peace

[Chorus]
I'm a boss, I got all these chicks on me
Only 26, – uh, call me "big homie"
Millions at my fingertips
Gold on the rollie
Soldier you whine, they want to ride the pony
I'm a boss, I got all these chicks on me
Only 26, – uh, call me "big homie"
Millions at my fingertips
Gold on the rollie
Soldier you whine, they want to ride the pony
