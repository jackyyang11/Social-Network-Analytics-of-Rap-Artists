[Intro: Dame D.O.L.L.A.]
Got me in my feelings
Got me in my feelings, uh, look

[Verse 1: Dame D.O.L.L.A.]
In my feelings, no shame 'cause you know just how we rock it
In the same building, you know how we get it poppin'
Know I do that wine-and-dinin', take ya ass shoppin'
Vacay on the private jet, laidin' in the trappers
Like a little sun, dimes in my environment
Play car, active ring, focus on retirement
Money ain't a problem, you be actin' shy, shit
Want you in the worst way, girl ain't no denyin' it
Hardly ever thirsty, got me on the border
Tryna keep it casual but this borderline torture
Better check the facts, I'm a bonafide scorer
TLC creepin', that's part of my aura
I'm a dime, better yet, I'm a boss
Get a lotta wins, on occasions, take a loss
It's been a minute since the dinner so you know a nigga floss
On that sushi floss, as you lemme hit raw, you feel

[Pre-Chorus: Ella Mai]
Ooh, now I'll never get over you until I find something new
That get me high like you do, yeah yeah
Ooh, now I'll never get over you until I find something new
That get me high like you do

[Chorus: Ella Mai & (P-Hu$tle)]
Listen to my heart go ba-dum, boo'd up
Biddy-da-dum, boo'd up (it's us)
Hear my heart go ba-dum, boo'd up (P-Hu$tle by the way)
Biddy-da-dum it just won't stop, it go (Dolla, what's happenin'?)
Ba-dum, boo'd up (back at it again)
Biddy-da-dum, boo'd up
Hear my heart go ba-dum, boo'd up (it's that one time for the one time)
Biddy-da-dum, it just won't stop, it go (ayy, ayy, aw)

[Verse 2: P-Hu$tle]
I can tell what you wishin' for, I can tell what you missin' though
Tell what you reachin' for, we gettin' closer to the mistletoe
And how I grip, no, I miss it though, fiasco, I kick it though
I see the signs, yeah I pay understand
No way to lyin', I pay tuitions
Enjoy the ride, we can make a livin'
Above the skies, yeah, above the ceilings
Respect my mind, yeah, respect my vision
She was there, no pot to piss in
I'm Michael Jack, I'm a bad Piston, listen
Ayy, appreciate your courage, she want that PHD, not designer purses, it's worth it
She alert when them sucker lurkin'
Ayy, too legit, my type of person, we workin'
I'm like ooh when I see you, hey boo when I see you
Got me in my feelings, woo, when I see ya

[Pre-Chorus: Ella Mai]
Ooh, now I'll never get over you until I find something new
That get me high like you do, yeah yeah
Ooh, now I'll never get over you until I find something new
That get me high like you do

[Chorus: Ella Mai]
Listen to my heart go ba-dum, boo'd up
Biddy-da-dum, boo'd up
Hear my heart go ba-dum, boo'd up
Biddy-da-dum it just won't stop, it go
Ba-dum, boo'd up
Biddy-da-dum, boo'd up
Hear my heart go ba-dum, boo'd up
Biddy-da-dum, it just won't stop, it go
