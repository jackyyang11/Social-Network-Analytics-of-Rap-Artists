[Verse 1: Damian Lillard]
It's always room for a real one cuz you can't finesse the grind
The chatter gets ignored because they hating from behind
It's gettin clear they bothered that I'm here
The top in my side mirror .. Closer than it appears
(Yea)
And my peers they know that I don't fit the stereotype
If I don't practice what I preach then you can bury me in white
And the fast life infected cuz it's full of parasites
Fine with sittin on the edge, I never been scared of heights
Married twice to the game ... But never to the fame
Flirting on occasion, cuz it double up the change
Never been a sucker for love or for the gain
But I been a fan of reaping the benefits for the pain
Bein drained after workouts, my asthma actin up
Me and Hou in elementary school had to catch the bus
Thought it was normal for that age ... Helped us turn the page
Went from Being innocent kids to ready for the stage
It was written ... I'd never lie to yall
And even on New Years I never drop the ball
Was always a misfit from what I can recall
Never been a walk of life for me, it's always been a jog..
And ima tell you what you feed the mind ultimately grows
I feed wisely and now I'm just reaping what I sowed
Conscious rap up in my speakers, Kendrick and J Cole
Why they asking who the best rapper in the league when they know... Dame Lillard
Stop playing... I give to em straight
Call me what you want, but you can never call me fake
I'm a real college grad ... And my Pockets full of cake
If you don't like me... It's jealousy or a mistake
I do it for the squad ... they already know
CFG the clique and the jungle where we grow
We beating down barriers and kickin down the door
Set the game on fire ...and let it burn slow
