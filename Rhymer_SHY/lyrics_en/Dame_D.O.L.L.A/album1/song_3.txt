[Hook: Adrian Marcel]
Living my dreams like I never had a nightmare
I'm ahead, I'm ahead, talking like light years
I don't see the same things when I'm way, when I'm way up, when I'm way up
It's hard to make it harder to stay up, stay up, stay up
I've been thinking, I've been seeing, I've been learning, I've been learning
Money show you how the world turning, money show
Old friends say I'm different 'cause I'm earning, I'm earning
What's a bridge when it's burning

[Verse 1: Dame D.O.L.L.A.]
It ain't the mountains ahead that weigh you down
It's the pebble in your shoe, heavy in my boots
Invested in the dream now I'm living on the screen
Everybody want the fruits, they say I got the juice
Humble beginnings is finished now I'm making millions
Funny how when tables get turned so do attendance
People get entitled like loyalty come with pension
My mind should be at ease, but I'm the one  that [?] attention
I heard my boy at the crib was talking down like (what?)
Dame ain't the same, he up on cloud nine
What an excuse to try give your pride a boost (sucker)
I gotta cut you loose but we could call it all a truce (it's love)
I hit my pops, he like "you owe these people nothing
Tell 'em what it is and it's not up for discussion
You gotta stand for something or you bound to fall for nothing"
Crazy how I got it all, at times it's like I'm suffering

[Verse 2: Dame D.O.L.L.A.]
The way I think is different, hard for me to pass a message (D.O.L.L.A.)
'Cause every word I speak is like a class in session
I mean well but the cash in my jeans swells so they probably take offense or it might just not ring bells
People I was tight with, now we ain't got much in common
Thinking about the times when we ain't complete assignments
Sad to think about all my friends that turned to violence, when they was showing promise
I'm just paying homage
I feel like a victim of success, it's lonely at the top
Every accomplishment people take the drop
A lot of vacant spots and struggling, I hate to watch
And more money, more problems, Mase was telling right
I started peeping that Jesus really the reason, I'm healthy every season and protected from the demons
And gold-digging women, that's plotting all over [?]
A life of cold guy game got the boy feeling anemic
