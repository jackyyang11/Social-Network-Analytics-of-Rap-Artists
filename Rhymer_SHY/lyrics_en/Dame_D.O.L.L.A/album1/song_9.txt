[Intro]
Dolla

[Verse 1: Dame D.O.L.L.A.]
Hit my line I'm in Mexico
Private resort and a butler
Reflect on my life by the ocean
Damn it was worth it to suffer
Hit up my brother my cousin
Real lovin' no discussion
Me and C plottin' on 'em
Y'all get ready for destruction
I don't be trippin' I say what I think and I'm stickin' to that
Hooping and rapping they tell me stop
But the numbers don't lie I get millions for that
They won't resent me for rap
I brought the synergy back
Y'all gimmicks be whack
I live with the energy packed
Lose in the offs I'll be back
A ring and my seat won't be stacked (UHH)
Been a hunnit on the daily (daily)
Wasn't born in the 80s (80s)
But that's the era that raised me
All gas never lazy
The ink on my body credential
They wonder what's next I'm suspenseful
I'm one and y'all two like the pencil
Respeck on my name I'm official
Money cover generations
My nephews is already kings (kings)
They don't ever ask for pictures (they don't)
We got dollars and dreams (dreams)
I'm rare in the sport and I know it
I'm not expecting the credit
All the dons get beheaded
Hundreds of mills when I exit
I don't take shots
I prefer Henney with rocks
I put my pennies in stocks
Most of these women be chopped
They lookin' for benjies a lot
Try not to judge
Lot of these people on drugs
Selfish and lookin' for plugs
Reach when they come to the club
Wanna be seen with the bulls
But sit in the crowd with the scrubs
Never gon' fold
Never gon' trip on my words
Never gon' care how they feel
Always been bold
I used to kick it with Nas
Forever gon' have that appeal
Really a boy
Really don't fit in the group
I been in the loop
Before I could bask in the fruit
I taylor my suits
These suckas ain't lacin' my boots
DOLLA

[Verse 2: P HU$TLE]
Chef master in the kitchen
Me no speak bout chicken
Batter coming I'm whisking
Me no labor non fiction
Bedroom be a graveyard
Me and sleep in a face off
Zombie eyes with a death walk
Me and spirit have a pep talk
Real eyes and real lies
Target on me heem roll tide
Some of y'all done code fried
I'll be here for the long ride
Rather do it then say it
You doing right they be hating
It's coming I'm working I'm patient
Keep living the odds you be facing
This is it with a moonwalk
Flight begins in June talk
Talking rock shot, hey Jayhawk
Grind mode like T Hawk
Everybody got input
Some he say she say
Peep game peep game
Things change things change
This a breeze this a breeze
They commercial make believe
Authentic the highest ambition
The hustle done got your attention!
P Hu$tle, P Hu$tle, and P Hu$tle

[Verse 3: Bozzle]
No we not like most guys
At they neck like a bow tie
On the Gram bout to go live
Celebrating getting high fives
I just be cooling with Doaty
Put a new stick on the 40
Ball til' I'm bald like Ginobili
I might get 60 like Kobe
Always be lining they raps
Saying they trap
But they not living like that
I just be spitting these packs
I could say you whack
We not gon' get into that
One of the best
I just thank Lord Finesse
Me and P Hu$tle we next
We just discussing
All of this money that's coming
When we was just up on the jet
