[Bridge: Sample]
We complement one another
Just like the colors of the rainbow
We'll paint the world with our colors
And everyone will know

[Verse 1: Dame Dolla]
Look for God when you try to defy the odds
Need to look up to the sky and let go of all the pride
The game changing
We're trying to make arrangements
And let go of all that anger
Put that food into our brain instead
Aim is steady at the youth
We're trying to change culture
New leaders, we ain't coming from that same holster
Been in that heat of the moment, we from that same toaster
Emotions rolling, just know I've been on that same coaster
That fame heavy weight to carry up to Heaven's gates
Know that heat rise
The devil got to levitate
We elevate, son
No hesitation
We was born to lose
But we're going to get it done

[Hook: Paul Rey]
I see sounds in my mind
I hear colors as I go
We all walk side by side
Even if we're on a different road, I know
Because this is something bigger than us
This is something bigger than us
This is something bigger than us
Even if we're all on different roads
I know, this is something bigger than us

[Verse 2: Dame Dolla]
I see the world from the lens of my own perspective
I see the anger driven by color and the recession
Sad to see the reality of our regression
Cops killing, drug selling in the state of depression
When I get pulled over should I be afraid?
Because lately the badge get in the way
If my attitude were bad because of the day
Would I threaten them enough where maybe I could catch a stray?
But it's a two way street you probably hate to hear
It kinda seems like they striking because it be out of fear
Aggressive kids getting bullets and then they be out of here
We mourning lately, gon' be some time before we'll be out of tears
No need to separate, remember that these times are cooler
We ain't dealing with segregation for all the schoolers
Throwing dirt on the work of Malcolm and Martin Luther
We stand together
Let's make it different than what we're used to

[Hook: Paul Rey]
I see sounds in my mind
I hear colors as I go
We all walk side by side
Even if we're on a different road, I know
Because this is something bigger than us
This is something bigger than us
This is something bigger than us
Even if we're all on different roads
I know, this is something bigger than us

[Bridge: Sample]
We compliment one another
Just like the colors of the rainbow
We'll paint the world with our colors
And everyone will know

[Verse 3: Dame Dolla]
God created us equal, so lets embrace it
And in life you run into evil, you gotta face it
Lets win the race instead of everything thinking racist
Bad habits we inflated, look what we created
We need change, better attitudes
To open up lanes, better avenues
Need to rise up, but we headed latitude
Lets try to think about the kids bred after you
Everyday I wake up and see the breaking news
About the hate crimes
Media gonna make you choose
Which side you gonna support so they get rates and views
Now people shooting up reporters because they hate the crews
We the people gotta love one another
Let it be known with nothing under cover
Lets take control of the future
Instead of letting it hover
Everybody to the table, make sure you're bringing something

[Outro: Paul Rey]
I see sounds in my mind
I hear colors as I go
We all walk side by side
Even if we're on a different road, I know
Because this is something bigger than us
This is something bigger than us
This is something bigger than us
Even if we're all on different roads
I know, this is something bigger than us
We compliment one another
(This is something bigger than us)
Just like the colors of the rainbow
This is something bigger than us
We'll paint the world with our colors
(This is something bigger than us)
This is something bigger than us
