[Intro]
Yeah
This got me fucked up (Hello)
I'm Marty Baller
Yeah

[Chorus]
Uh, wonder why these niggas all mad at me
(Wonder why these niggas all mad at me)
I put in the work and I came from the streets
(I put in the work and I came from the streets)
I was so hungry I had to go eat
(I was so hungry I had to go eat)
Now when I smile I got racks on my teeth
(Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Shootin in back of the jeep
Case niggas actin on me
I got the jacket on me
Dab me a ratchet on me
So don't step in my face
Unless you want to get these writs
I on my way down to the bank
To put my money in the safe
Last year being broke, first year being rich
In the city like I'm big
You can find out where I live
New house new crib
Late up eatin' ribs
Hennessy in the Fridge
In the cup minding my biz

[Chorus]
Uh, wonder why these niggas all mad at me
(Wonder why these niggas all mad at me)
I put in the work and I came from the streets
(I put in the work and I came from the streets)
I was so hungry I had to go eat
(I was so hungry I had to go eat)
Now when I smile I got racks on my teeth
(Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Now I can do what I want
Don't throw a five on the blunt
Call mines to eat lunch
Mixing Cîroc with the punch
Sipping rosé at a brunch
Bring my shorty to the front
Buy my shorty what she want
Loui Vuitton for the clutch
God damn I really made it
Walk around my crib naked
Chilling and I'm getting faded
Came up I was in the basement
All I had you that nigga
I'm starting to feel like that nigga
I want my chain to get bigger
I want my ring to get bigger

[Interlude]
(I want my chain to get big, I want my ring to get big)
(I want my chain to get big, I want my ring to get bigger)
(I want my chain to get big)
(I want my chain to get big, I want my ring to get big)
(I want my chain to get big, I want my ring to get bigger)
(I want my chain to get big)


[Chorus]
Ah
Uh, wonder why these niggas all mad at me
I put in the work and I came from the streets
I was so hungry I had to go eat
Now when I smile I got racks on my teeth

[Outro]
I want a plug that flows
I want to ride in a Porsche
I ride that girl like a horsey
I have more boys than Rick Rossy
I'm trying to cop me a loath
Look at these diamonds like floss
I want to swerve in my lanes
My bitch want to do it the same
