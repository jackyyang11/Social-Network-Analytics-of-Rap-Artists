[Intro]
Monsta gon tear it up

[Pre-Chorus: Reese Laflare]
Bad Bitch, that's a money fetish
She drive stick, Yeah, that's automatic
Stormin' through the night like I'm Gladys, yuh
That ain't liquir, that just Actavis
Fuck a wedding ring, I'm on my savage shit
She rolling plays, yeah she on her madden shit
Fucked her, now she calling me, your majesty
Fist full of racks, I blow it, magic city

[Chorus: 5:AM]
I got bad bitches all up in my face
But I'm just chillin', tell them hoes I need my space
I just want to cop a Rari then a wraith
Throw the money, put the molly in her face
I got bad bitches all up in my face
But I'm just chillin', tell them hoes I need my space
I just want to cop a Rari then a wraith
Throw the money, put the molly in her face

[Verse 1: 5:AM]
I got bad bitches all up in my face
They be beggin' for Supreme and some BAPE
They be beggin' for a ride and a wraith
I'm an artist, gotta let me paint your face
Shorty love smokin' dope, I got an eight, a yeah
I ain't never have to fuck cuz she was taken, a yeah
Walkin' siren, creepers lookin' like the matrix, a yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Reese Laflare]
Bad Bitch, that's a money fetish
She drive stick, Yeah, that's automatic
Stormin' through the night like I'm Gladys, yuh

Fuck a wedding ring, I'm on my savage shit
She rolling plays, yeah she on her madden shit
Fucked her, now she calling me, your majesty
Fist full of racks, I blow it, magic city

[Chorus: 5:AM]
I got bad bitches all up in my face
But I'm just chillin', tell them hoes I need my space
I just want to cop a Rari then a wraith
Throw the money, put the molly in her face
I got bad bitches all up in my face
But I'm just chillin', tell them hoes I need my space
I just want to cop a Rari then a wraith
Throw the money, put the molly in her face

[Verse 2: Marty Baller]
Hello
Couple bitches in that, know they wanna play
They ain't fuckin then they fuckin get replaced
She can tell by my diamonds, I got taste
She can tell by the Goyard on my waste
Little bitch you ain't gettin' to my safe
For my money, I'mma go and catch a case
Got me high right now, on a eight
In Atlanta and I'm smokin' to the face

[Bridge: Marty Baller]
With a bag and know I gotta chase
All these hoes wanna get up in my place
They talkin' shit but they don't say it to my face
That Desert Eagle, it'll put em in their place

[Pre-Chorus: Reese Laflare]
Bad Bitch, that's a money fetish
She drive stick, Yeah, that's automatic
Stormin' through the night like I'm Gladys, yuh
That ain't liquor, that just Actavis
Fuck a wedding ring, I'm on my savage shit
She rolling plays, yeah she on her madden shit
Fucked her, now she calling me, your majesty
Fist full of racks, I blow it, magic city

[Chorus: 5:AM]
I got bad bitches all up in my face
But I'm just chillin', tell them hoes I need my space

Throw the money, put the molly in her face
I got bad bitches all up in my face
But I'm just chillin', tell them hoes I need my space
I just want to cop a Rari then a wraith
Throw the money, put the molly in her face
