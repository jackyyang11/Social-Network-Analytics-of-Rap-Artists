[Verse 1]
Hello
I'm so drunk in the club, let me sit
Pass the mic, Marty Baller 'bout to spit
Sip lean, spit a mean 16
Vans on with a pair of ripped jeans
Bathing Ape when I'm rolling with my team
45 trucks when we pull up on the scene
Shit me can't believe what I've seen
I'm a monster, ain't no Halloween
Dominican mommy, I make her scream
Right when I've finished with mommy, she meet the team
Addicted to molly, money, call her a fiend
Probably popping pussy in the back of the limousine
Tryna get a bag or a trip the the Philippines
Only thing I'm cuffing the bottom my Billie Jeans
Only thing I'm puffing is trees, better be green
Niggas out in Cali, the valley know what I mean

[Hook]
I ain't tryna talk to nobody less than my bro
Do a little shopping until I'm ready to go
Walk around my hood and they try and tell me I owe
You when I invited you to a show
I know you want money, you trying making some dope
Tryna come around, you like "Marty, my little bro"
Tryna come around with your weed, I'm getting low
Niggas want something, haven't seen these niggas before

[Verse 2]
In the club [?] she bought me mo'
Snuck the lean in the club, now I'm pouring a fo'
If they find out, they kicking me out the door
But if they kick me out, they ain't never seeing a show
Peep my bitch and I'm tryna go pro
True to my religion, I'm giving 'em elbows
Take 'em out of heaven, I'm giving 'em hell, bro
Smoking on that sticky, that yicky, that Velcro
You be smoking Knicks in the Carmelo
My shawty got a booty that's softer than Jello
Put my head on the booty, felt like a pillow
Every time I hit it, I'm hard as a Brillo
7, 8 rounds, I'm freaky, a nympho
I'm high to the sky and I'm playing Nintendo
My momma want a rent while I'm blowing this endo
Momma, don't you worry, I'm copping that Enzo

[Hook]
I ain't tryna talk to nobody less than my bro
Do a little shopping until I'm ready to go
Walk around my hood and they try and tell me I owe
You when I invited you to a show
I know you want money, you trying making some dope
Tryna come around, you like "Marty, my little bro"
Tryna come around with your weed, I'm getting low
Niggas want something, haven't seen these niggas before
