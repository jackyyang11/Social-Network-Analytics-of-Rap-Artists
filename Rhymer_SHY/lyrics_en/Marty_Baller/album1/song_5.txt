[Intro]
Yeah, I see you nigga (Hello)
Got me shitting on my ex, yeah

[Hook]
(Who they gon') flex, flex, flex, flex
(Now who they gon') flex, flex, flex, flex
Leave them pussy niggas wet, Marty know that they upset
Man, I'm all about my checks, and I'm shitting on my ex
Flex, flex, flex, flex
(Who they gon') flex, flex, flex, flex
When I walk up on the scene, niggas staring at my jeans
Doing shit you never seen, mask on, Halloween
Flex, flex, flex, flex
Flex, flex, flex, flex
You don't know then I don't know, me, I'm all about my dough
'Bout to have another show, get my chips, I gotta go

[Verse 1]
Tryna cop a Porsche, tell me what it cost
Wanna start it up, it sound like a horse
Leave them niggas lost, and I'm on that sauce
And I feel like Ross, know that I'm a boss
Please don't get me drunk, I'd rather blow that skunk
Know my bitch is bad, and she got a donk
"Marty put me on, you know I'm tryna spit"
I just tell them niggas, "come up with a hit"
You know I'm with the shits, I'm too legit to quit
When I have a show, bitches show they tits
Stand up on the stage, they try to grab my dick
Bitches want a pic, niggas want a pic

[Hook]
Flex, flex, flex, flex
(Now who they gon') flex, flex, flex, flex
Leave them pussy niggas wet, Marty know that they upset
Man, I'm all about my checks, and I'm shitting on my ex
Flex, flex, flex, flex
Flex, flex, flex, flex
When I walk up on the scene, niggas staring at my jeans
Doing shit you never seen, mask on, Halloween
Flex, flex, flex, flex
Flex, flex, flex, flex
You don't know then I don't know, me, I'm all about my dough
'Bout to have another show, get my chips, I gotta go

[Verse 2]
Man, I'm all about dough, fuck your bitch, I don't know
She was loving my flow, she ain't paid for a show
Starting to feel Al 'Po, money calling, I'll go
Make it rain, I make it snow, count the money, watch it grow
Still get it for the low, all the kush that I blow
Backwoods with me, rolled, when I'm out on the road
When I'm out on the road, yeah, I'm fucking your hoe
When I'm fucking your hoe, got her touching her toes
All this money that I blow, we could never keep it low
Get my shit, I gotta go, sayonara, adios
Let the dope be in the boats, bet I take her coast to coast
All these bitches do the most, get the trips and then I'm ghost

[Hook]
Flex, flex, flex, flex
(Now who they gon') flex, flex, flex, flex
Leave them pussy niggas wet, Marty know that they upset
Man, I'm all about my checks, and I'm shitting on my ex
