[Intro: Beleaf]
Yo, don't play me
I don't do that regular formula
I need the sensitive stomach formula with the purple label
You know what I mean?
Yeah, Trente
Earth's best

[Verse 1: Beleaf]
No I don't want no duffel bag
Cause everything I need fit right in these compartments
And yeah I know these colors bright
But they coordinate well with everything from target
I pull out my coupons and my red cart
Saved about 6 dollars, oh my lard
What you know about getting discounts?
What you say girl? I ain't paying this ammount
What you know about lookin [?] walking through the parking lot with a double stroller
What you know about starting your day off with some Elmo and some Left Roasters
Man I keep the pop tarts busting out the toaster
What you know about a coaster?
What you know about the back up bibs and the mesh part where you keep the new q-tips
And you don't really know what act up is
Until your kids act like they don't know you
And you gotta show your proof of parenthood to a stranger
It's in the diaper bag lemme show you

[Bridge: Beleaf]
I've never been a backpack rapper
But this diaper bag feeling quite nice
Tryna turn my dollars into nappers
So I can spend some time with my wife

[Hook: Beleaf]
I got milk I got milk
I got diapers I got wipes
[x3]
It's in my diaper bag
It's in my diaper bag

[Verse 2: Beleaf]
You know I got them snacks on deck
Keep them all in the zip lock
Goldfish, Apples cut up
Binky, Blankey, y'all know what up
And poop smells got levels
Stinky, stankey... Gross
And tell me what I did to deserve this, ha?
Tell me what I did
It's all about slipping round the house
Only to find the desert that was stuck behind your couch
It's all about having a bad day
And you couldn't clean
People coming over unannounced
It's all about waiting for grandma
So you and your wife could bounce
Getting to the spot realizing that you took the diaper bag
So it's back to the house

[Bridge: Beleaf]
I've never been a backpack rapper
But this diaper bag feeling quite nice
Tryna turn my dollars into nappers
So I can spend some time with my wife

[Hook: Beleaf]
I got milk I got milk
I got diapers I got wipes
[x3]
It's in my diaper bag
It's in my diaper bag

[Outro]
I got milk [x2]
