[Intro]
I don't know what to say
Man, I don't know what to say
We here
And just being here is, it's a beautiful thing

[Verse 1]
This up here is peer pressure
Pick your poison then measure
Swim in it like the ocean
Drowning's the only dosage
I'm seeing double vision, double vision
20-20, 40-40 I am focused
The Spirit in me and you dates the hocus pocus
Baptising in saliva shower in my hood
Where precious flint that is polishing my grind
One day I will shine, let's get to the root
One day I will vine, my children will climb
And touch the branches that hold the weight of a panda
Like peaches out in Atlanta, like leaves tasting like manna
You golden children, you gon' make it
If you just keep your hands up, you know the feeling
You forsaken, you foresee the Savanah
You know the promise that landed
You know the man who had planned
And I'ma see that you see it
If I don't see it I'll manage, I'll vanish
Into thin air, this appears peer pressure
Pick your poison, all your choices balance out if you measure

[Hook]
All I need is the light
Point me in the direction
Direction
Your love holding me tight
I just need your protection
Protection

[Verse 2]
This what up here is simplistic
Broke your heart then I fixed it
Didn't finish your wishlist
But I buttered your biscuit
You smelling my incense
I'm burning that temper
I'm smelling your senses, the name I can't remember
Aromas are unforgettable, I be wishing they edible
I be seeming poetical, but I'm really a douche
Homies say I'm a jerk, with you I see the proof
I'm really sorry 'bout that, there's really no excuse
I would let the rhythm hit 'em, but the bars are not conducive
He was in kindergarten, you my pick for duck-duck goosey
Always picked the girl you like, that's how I play
I make the rules, I always knew you'd be my wife
You cared about my cuticles
And I'm like dang you're cute and cool
I might lose a leg for you
I'm Kunta Kinte, I might kill the Koopa dragon captured you
I'm still in shackles but
This one up here is simplistic
My love tank is on empty
I'm remaining optimistic for you

[Hook]
All I need is the light
Point me in the direction
Direction
Your love holding me tight
I just need your protection
Protection
