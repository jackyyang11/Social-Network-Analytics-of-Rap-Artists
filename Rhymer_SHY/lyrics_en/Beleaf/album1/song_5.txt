Boy, you are something special
And you got a gift
You better believe in yourself
4x

I would daydream while at home alone
In the mirror held my wave brush like a microphone
Hat to the side, imitating what I saw
Quoting Busta Rhyme lyrics like
"yah yah yah"

Dropped the microphone and the people would applaud
Even acted out reactions imagination at large

I had no idea what I wanted to be when I grew up
I just knew that I no longer wanted to be a screw up

My mama was abusive
I thought I was a nuisance
I knew one day I'd grow up eventually chuck the deuces
But then what would I do then?
Because I had no talent
I knew not to dream, just to consider opinions
And people would blah blah blah blah blah
Like if I were you, I would be a doctor that's what I would do
And no one told me to follow my dreams, so I had no clue that
They would say

Boy, you are something special
And you got a gift
You better believe in yourself

Time was ticking and I'm sittin' eatin' pizzas
While my homeboys was graduating, working on their thesis
They're developing careers and I'm getting to know the Jesus
Still had no idea one day he would call me out of the bleachers
I'm poppin' wheelies with shopping carts
Who knew that one day I would be shopping music to the owners of all the parking lots?
Using shea butter to twist my locks
I forgot
I was still depressed and insecure, so distraught
I didn't know how to change heart of mind
I just had a sense of urgency, was running out of time
Has anybody ever felt this way, felt this way?
Like everything wasn't gon' be ok, be ok?
So my dream was taken by nightmares
It seemed that all my positivity was few and far between
But I seemed very nice and sweet-hearted
In denial is exactly where I started
You don't know

Boy, you are something special
And you got a gift
You better believe in yourself

Yeah, I am black sugar!
That's me!
Alright, back to the joint
