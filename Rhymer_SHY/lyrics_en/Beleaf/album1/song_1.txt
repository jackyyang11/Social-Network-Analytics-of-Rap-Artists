[Chorus: Beleaf]
What’s it gon’ take huh?
What’s it gon’ take to activate you?
Lil’ boy, huh?
What’s it gon’ take huh?
What’s it gon’ take to activate you?
Lil’ boy, huh?
What's it gon' take?

[Verse 1: Beleaf]
Take me out of the hood
But you can’t take my mind
It’s me verse everybody
Kinda like I’m [?]
If you take a prisoner outside of jail
And you put him in a castle
He still thinking that he doing time
I’ve been trapped in my mind
And I swear that no one knows
If I'm quiet as [?]
I do what I’m supposed to
[?] soul for gold
Still a Dream Junkie
Though not written on my arm
And I don’t give a darn ‘bout
Who sticking 'round
Who keeping up with me
Or who say they gon’ hold me down
Cause what I found
By staying loyal to the crowd
The dude who put you on
Will mess around and bite your style
I’ll never jeopardise my family again for friends
Or pals, or buddies, or fans, or smiles
Or trials and tribulations, they all just situations
And I count them all joy
My obituary gon’ be amazing

[Chorus: Beleaf]
What’s it gon’ take huh?
What’s it gon’ take to activate you?
Lil’ boy, huh?
What’s it gon’ take?
What’s it gon’ take to activate you?
Lil’ boy, huh?
What’s it gon’ take?

[Bridge: Charlie Powers]
And I just really need a messenger
A messenger, message
They saying everything’s a lesson learned
A lesson, learn your lesson
And I’m just trying to get my blessings
And my blessings and my blessings
Does it activate me?
Does it activate?

[Verse 2: Beleaf]
Take me out or take me back
Even if I got the juice
I knew the little engine could
That’s why I never rode caboose
We could have been a big deal
And also made a lot of loot
But when you do it for the money
Friendships, you’ll prolly lose
By now I know I paid my dues
If you counting the ahs and oohs
And if you see me on the screen
Just know it’s not for the views
If you’re not in tune
And you hear one of my interludes
It’s not unusual
Just be sure to play that at my funeral
Take me out of the church
And that won't mean it works
If I fit in then, it might just be a hearse
That I sit in, and if I’m crowd surfing
All the homies walking with me
Might be pallbearing
It really just matter who swimming
With me inside the current
It might just be my kids
Cause my wife is far from barren
It took too many years for me
To get acclimated
It’s funny how pain can allow you to be activated
Huh

[Chorus: Beleaf]
What’s it gon’ take huh?
What’s it gon’ take to activate you?
Lil’ boy, huh?
What’s it gon’ take?
What’s it gon’ take to activate you?
Lil’ boy, huh?
What’s it gon’ take?

[Bridge: Charlie Powers]
And I just really need a messenger
A messenger, message
They saying everything’s a lesson learned
A lesson, learn your lesson
And I’m just trying to get my blessings
And my blessings and my blessings
Does it activate me?
Does it activate?
