[Hook]
I long to capture the days I slept away, lie awake
Chasing after goals that I have never made, I'm blasé

[Verse 1]
Everybody ask what I want, what I want
And they pick at my brain and they pull out the stump
I'ma stump 'em
Take they shotguns and they p-pump p-pumpin' they questions
And I'm like "Uh huh, uh huh" I don't know how to respond
To the peons beyond being polite
Being [?], being a light, be a cool [?]
My daddy and my mommy say "sonny, be nice"
He cool, calm, collected, but I'm tryna be ice
Dudes is being fly, but I'm tryna be flight
Some say life's a gamble while I'm tryna be dice

Come roll with a guy who really don't know where the hell he going
And I don't know what I wanna be when I grow up
I'm telling you right now, I don't know enough
All I know is that I'm showing up... late
Teacher ask me why I can't pass the test
And I said "yo, I don't know this stuff"
But wait (there's more!)
Meet and greet for these carnivores
Can't nobody make it out of Baltimore
Funny that Baltimore tell me the art of war isn't the all to war
Tell me the best of things like
Never underestimate and you could strike first
Before it escalates, I'm in my batter's box
With my fancy socks and they throwing rocks
And that's strike one and that's strike two
So I swing away and I run a run home
But I cannot play 'em

[Hook]
I long to capture the days I slept away, lie awake
Chasing after goals that I have never made, I'm blasé
I long to capture the days I slept away, lie awake
Chasing after goals that I have never made, I'm blasé

[Verse 2]
How the opinions of many men will offend
Not accompanied with experience
See a penny for your thoughts only take two cents
Two pennies in my pocket turn into a nuisance
Any rhyme is a barcode
Read between the lines and I crossed it
Took a sniff, lost it
Man, aw dang, this is awkward
I can hear the drips from the faucet
I been in the kitchen whipping with the sauces
Head in the sky with the flying saucers
Here an eye for an eye, don't care who the boss is
Walking on a tightrope, oh no no no, cautious
You're walking with the complicator
Complex of the complexion
I'm confident that being black is a compliment
And everybody thinking different is incompetent
I'm Melanin [?]
Tell a sarcophagus I'ma buss off some brick walls
Down I'ma showdown [?] hoedown
Naughty by Mother Nature
Not cause I hate ya, cause I owe the Junkies a favor
Shoutout to my cousin Neighbor
Save the flicks on your Bic for my swisher sweet
One more time on that rotation 'fore I hit delete
And every dog got its day so I sic the beat
I'm sick and tired of being sick and trying to be the nicest
When my homie's in a crisis
I'm sitting there lifeless
I can't even pray cause I got too many vices
I ain't looking for advice 'cause
I know the difference between wrong and right
I know it's time for me to change my life
When I put down the mic, I know my future bright
But I'm---
