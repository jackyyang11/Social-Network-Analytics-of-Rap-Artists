[Intro:]

If I told you that faith and love is blind unless you believe in em, could you see the difference?

[Hook:]

I… wanted you to know, I see it, yeah… I see it
I wanted you to know I see it…
Yeah... I see it
I… wanted you to know, I see it, yes I see it


[Verse 1:]

I got that Hosea love
Not to take away the sins of a whole player’s club
Why don’t you stay a while, let me romance you
I love how your heart breaks
Eternity in every tear here’s my handkerchief
Truthfully, the truth it doesn’t rhyme
You wonder how
The world has left you out to dry under a thundercloud
I never sung it loud [?]
Can I wash you?
I paid the pipe so that the shower wouldn’t cost you
Know that I never lost you, I knew you from the start
Gave you the choice to stay or leave hoping you’d hear my heart
Nevertheless, I faithfully promise to play my part
I’m right here, young soul, just know that my name is God
And I love you, always…


[Hook:]

I… wanted you to know, I see it, yeah… I see it
I… wanted you to know I see it…
Yeah… I see it
I… wanted you to know I see it yes I see it


[Outro:]

Yes I see it, Yes I see it…
