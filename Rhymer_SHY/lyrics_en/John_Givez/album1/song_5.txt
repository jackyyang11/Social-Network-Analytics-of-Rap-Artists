[Hook]
You make things so metaphysical
I lay up, looking for my sanity
Put numbers on the board, call it digital
I can't hold back this gravity
Fixing
You're my drug
I need a fixing
You're my favorite drug

[Verse 1]
Young General-ly speaking
Hate when I'm drunk on the weekend
Niggas go dumb for the nightlife
Just to find something to leave with
In my mind, pulled off in a G6
Knowing damn well I was in a Grand Jeep Cherokee
Playing backroll, defense
And I'm on my way to you
Can I stay for a while?
Can I lay up in your bedroom looking at your shape in a towel
Ain't too far from a free throw
Looking at your screen, play fragrant vows
Jesus, save that man
With a limp in his walk
Living in a world where the boys and the girls
Can't say what they want
Living in a time where a man and a woman
Can't be what they need
Love is a drug
And I'm living like a fiend, baby girl

[Hook]
You make things so metaphysical
I lay up, looking for my sanity
Put numbers on the board, call it digital
I can't hold back this gravity
Fixing
You're my favorite drug
I need a fixing
You're my favorite drug

[Verse 2]
Take time for the come down, tell me can you handle it?
Make time for the run down, play it like an analyst
Good God, thinking of checking into rehab
Think I need a doctor to proctor the exam whenever I relapse
Do you know what you're doing to me?
Getting better but I'm still so sick
31 flavors, I'ma take my pick
Only one you when I take that trip
Same old bag is the same old shit
God damn, I'm a Junkie
Looking for a refill, yeah
My prescription is monthly
Living on a high
Stevie Wonder will I ever see a ribbon in the sky?

[Hook]
You make things so metaphysical
I lay up, looking for my sanity
Put numbers on the board, call it digital
I can't hold back this gravity
Fixing
You're my favorite drug
I need a fixing
You're my favorite drug
One more time, real soft
You make things so metaphysical
I lay up, looking for my sanity
Put numbers on the board, call it digital
I can't hold back this gravity
Fixing
You're my favorite drug
I need a fixing
You're my favorite drug
