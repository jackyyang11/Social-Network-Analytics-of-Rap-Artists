[Pre-Hook]
Listen up, I'll tell you how it's goin' baby
Talkin' ain't enough, I gotta show baby
Can I take it, take it back in time?
Memories all up on my mind

This a song about 2004
Listen, now you know
This a song about 2004
Listen, now you know
This a song about 2004
Listen, now you know
This a song about 2004
Listen, now you know

[Verse 1]
Tell me you remember me, yes, uh, Lord
Summer, Spring, Fall, and Winter all in one accord
Correlatin' with my cuddies
Tryna holla at the cuties with the money
Buy your boy a bag of chips
Baggin' chicks and shootin' jumpshots
I know you know them city transportation bus stops
Hit the Boys & Girls Club to see my main thing
Her name was Destiny, she liked them boys that gangbanged
Tell her, "Call me gangsta"
Walkin' home from school, and I just pray that them boys don't chase ya
Not tradin' my stereo, I take it everywhere I go
Oceanside, California, that's where I'm from
If you scared, go to church
If you feelin' froggy, grab your gun
That's not the way my daddy taught me, nah
A Baptist boy, I gotta wash this badness off me
Pool of water, pull you farther from this sinnin' world
Jesus love the little children, all the boys and girls
Sing this boys and girls

[Pre-Hook]
Listen up, I'll tell you how it's goin' baby
Talkin' ain't enough, I gotta show baby
Can I take it, take it back in time?
Memories all up on my mind

[Verse 2]
Tell me you remember me
Yes, indeed
Fallin' into Winter, Spring, to summers at the beach
I'm politickin' with my people now
Pedal to the metal, handle bars squeakin' now
I got some place to be
Hit the Eribertos, eat comida
I got a plate to eat
I play a game of dominoes with Donald off Redando Street
Got him beat, that's Geronimo
Smack him down and go
Smellin' marijuana smoke, my next door neighbor's eyes be low
He playin' Bone Thugs, singing harmonies
My momma told me, "Don't be messin' with that ganja leaf"
She know I got that rebel in me, tryna try things
Usher Raymond baby, girl, she like it my way
I wish everyday was Friday
Free yo' mind, free yo' freaky mind
Free it 'til you remember the times
When it ain't feel like time
When it just feel like la
La-la, la-la, la, la, la
This my song, but you can play it when it feel right

[Pre-Hook]
Listen up, I'll tell you how it's goin' baby
Talkin' ain't enough, I gotta show baby
Can I take it, take it back in time?
Memories all up on my mind
