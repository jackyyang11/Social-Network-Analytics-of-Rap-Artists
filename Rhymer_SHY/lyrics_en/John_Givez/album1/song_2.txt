Chilling on Saturday night, it's me and some of the crew
Jungle, he came with the hype, Anthony came with the Cruz
I got a 2 dolla' mic, in the Marley Meadows Apartments
Where Sydney let us record this

When I get home to you
I swear it's just like the same
But still it ain't no complaining though
When I get home to you
Cause you know a nigga still willing and able
When I get home to you
When I got a lot on my mind and I'm feeling I'm out of time
When I get home to you
I gotta do what I do just to keep you staying

This is ain't no cheap thrill
Gotta pay attention to them frequencies
I'm just looking for some Face Time
What's up with all these inconsistencies?
At your service with this purpose inside of my heart
Sometimes it hurts that you hide in my art
And when I leave I be thinking of you
And how we do what we do what we do

Saturday night chilling with 2 dolla' mic

It's okay girl, I'm gonna be all right tonight
You don't have to call
