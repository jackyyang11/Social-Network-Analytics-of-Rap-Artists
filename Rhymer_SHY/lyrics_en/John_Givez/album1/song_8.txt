[Verse 1: John Givez]
Momma I don't wanna be a playa
I got too many other problems
Momma if you would say a prayer
I hope the man up there can solve them
I been on the same old, same old things, yeah
And I don't see no way to stop it
I don't wanna be a playa no more
It ain't no other way to call it
I put up a fight
This right here might make you change your life
Put away your games, go ahead and get it right
This right here might make you change your life
Put away your games, go ahead and get it right
I put up a fight
This right here might make you change your life
Put away your games, go ahead and get it right
This right here might make you change your life
Put away your games, go ahead and get it right

[Verse 2: JGivens]
So evidently, you thinking what you learned in elementary was only specifically for you
Consider me the future you
And you could be remember what I used to do
And you could do this, and you could do that
Dismiss this, and I could never exist, and that's that
John, boy you know you really better knock
Like you ain't got dots
On them dominos, on your momma's door
On my momma though, your momma don't stop
Singing like the Commodores to a God prayin', falling down like geronimo
For a lil' engine that could really be on honor roll
But he on E on a roll [?]
Drive slow and you still get got
The only way to go, stop
Boom

I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, wanna be (x8)

Play on, playa, play on
Play on, playa, play on
This might make you
Play on, playa, play on
Play on, playa, play on
This might make you
Play on, playa, play on
Play on, playa, play on
I don't wanna be a playa no more
I got too many other problems
Momma I don't wanna be a playa no more
Momma I don't
