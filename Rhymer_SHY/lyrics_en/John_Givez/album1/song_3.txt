[Intro]
Ayy
Oh yeah
Ayy
Oh yeah

[Chorus]
2 Steppin'
Me and you in the middle of the room
2 Steppin'
Ayy

[Verse 1]
I lost my head
Cut off my legs
I didn't know my enemy
Was living in the inner me
Til you, you came and fed
You gave me bread
I'm healing off your energy
I'm healing off your energy
Ayy
We like to party
Said I think I wanna party
Don’t wanna hurt nobody
Really don't wanna hurt nobody
World gone crazy
That's why I need you for my baby
Ain't got nothing to lose
When it's me and you right there in the middle of the room

[Chorus]
2 Steppin'
Me and you in the middle of the room
2 Steppin'
Me and you in the middle of the room
2 Steppin'
Me and you in the middle of the room
2 Steppin'
Ayy

[Verse 2]
Ayy let's get lost
You know money ain't a thang
What's the cost?
You've been running through my mind
Can’t get off yeah
Can you be my Cardi B? Baby, Off Set
Ayy, this ain't only for the camera
When they see us in the streets, they can't stand us
Ahh, this the high life
2 Steppin' with my baby in the lime light
I found my way
I know I found my way
Cuz' now I know my enemy
Was living in the inner me
You gave me faith
You saved the day
I'm healing off your energy
I'm living off your energy
Make me a believer
I'm never gonna deceive ya'
Put you in a 2 seater
Let your love turn me into a leader
Ayyy, world gone crazy
That's why I need you for my baby
Ain't got nothing to lose
When it's me and you right there in the middle of the room

[Chorus]
2 Steppin'
Me and you in the middle of the room
2 Steppin'
Me and you in the middle of the room
2 Steppin'
Me and you in the middle of the room
2 Steppin'

[Outro]
2 Step for me baby
2 Step
2 Step for me baby
2 Step
2 Step for me baby
2 Step
2 Step for me baby
2 Step
