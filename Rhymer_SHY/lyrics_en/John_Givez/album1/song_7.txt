[Intro]
I believe we can keep the promise of our founders, the idea that if you're willing to work hard, it doesn't matter who you are or where you come from or what you look like or where you love. It doesn't matter whether you're black or white or Hispanic or Asian or Native American or young or old or rich or poor, able, disabled, gay or straight, you can make it here in America if you're willing to try

[Bridge]
Uh huh, believe that
American dream, telling me I need that
Mo' money, 'mo problems
Where the weed at
(I'm a) Pour me up a cup of Hennessy and relax

[Verse 1]
We live in a generation where the lies look
Good enough to lie in 'em, get yo mind took
My cousin caught a DUI and got his ride took
The homie in and out of prison cause the price of a squared away life is too
Risky, gimme some whiskey I'm a pour it up
Drop a four into 20 oz and slow it up
Pop a couple pills in the bathroom, throwing up, pass out
Wake up in the morning now I'm rollin' up
These are just the patterns of the 80's passed to the 90's babies
Everybody underneath the influence, crash babies
Home of the free and land of the brave
If it's one nation under God how we still slaves, to the crave for the next high
But we living solo
Uncontrolled sex drive, Austin Power mojo
Baby boom promo, say it on the screen

The American dream

[Hook]
Oh say can you see
The ramparts we watch
We're so gallantly streaming
Star spangled bursting bomb's
The American dream
The American dream
Everything ain't always what it seems
But we still lean on American dreams

[Verse 2]
We live in a generation where the Benjamin Franks
Fly whips and gold chains is religion, give thanks
Pimping from the pulpit, the wolves out to play
Only 9.99 for the pain to go away
Peter Popper, gimme the drop off
I'm a make it flip
Am I a prophet for the way I profit all these chips
Baby pop it for a real one on stripper poles
Taking off her clothes
Really she losing all her soul for a man she doesn't know
It's the pattern of the 80's passed to the 90's babies
Everybody underneath the influence, crash babies
Home of the free and land of the lame
If it's one nation under God why we ain't changed
Break the chains for a real high
No more living solo
Tell 'em what it feel like, Austin Power mojo
Baby boom promo, say it on the screen
Television broadcast legacy at 16
The American Dream

[Outro]
In America you either dying to live or living to die
Or wherever else for that matter
Choose wisely

You know what I mean
And those are those dudes
Those are the type of dudes that come here, to church
Because he comes here to church
And those are the dudes that are coming to the shows
And so it's like
That brother's street credibility is weird is as to say about
As a Christian artist
