[Chorus: Aaron Cole]
I was wrong (Wrong) to ever let you go
You're the one (Oh, yeah, yeah) and I see it now
I give it all, I give it all, I give it all, I give it all, I give it all, I give it all
’Cause you deserve everything and more (yeah), oh

[Verse 1: Hollyn]
We were best friends, yeah, I thought that you knew that
Every night on the phone, we were cool, yeah
Then you said I'm all you ever wanted
Felt the same, didn't say that I loved you

[Refrain: Hollyn]
Oh whoa whoa
I was too scared to admit it
Oh whoa whoa
I’m gonna say what's on my mind, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Hollyn]
Wish I could go back, make things right (Right)
Shoulda told you like a thousand times
Shoulda never let you go
Yeah, now I know

[Chorus: Aaron Cole, Aaron Cole & Hollyn]
I was wrong (Wrong) to ever let you go
You're the one (Oh, yeah, yeah) and I see it now
I give it all, I give it all, I give it all, I give it all, I give it all, I give it all
'Cause you deserve everything and more, oh

[Verse 2: Hollyn]
Turnin' off the radio, our song, it's not helpin'
Got the same friends, no it never ends
Saying that she makes you happy

[Refrain: Hollyn]
Oh whoa whoa
If I could tell you right now what I'm thinkin’
Oh whoa whoa
I’m tryin' to get you off my mind, yeah yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Hollyn]
So, I’m goin' to the movies all alone (Alone)
And now I'm smellin' your cologne (Cologne)
I can’t escape these memories
They're hauntin' me, oh

[Chorus: Aaron Cole, Hollyn, both]
I was wrong (I was wrong) to ever let you go (oh)
You're the one (Oh, yeah, yeah) and I see it now
I give it all, I give it all, I give it all, I give it all, I give it all, I give it all
'Cause you deserve everything and more, oh

[Bridge: Aaron Cole, Hollyn, both]
If it ain't you, then I don't want nobody else
Take nobody else, oh (No, no, oh)
And tell me the truth (Ooh)
Do I ever stand a chance
To feel your love again?
Whoa-oh

[Chorus: Aaron Cole, Hollyn, Both]
I was wrong (Wrong) to ever let you go (Oh)
You're the one (Oh, yeah, yeah) and I see it now
I give it all, I give it all, I give it all, I give it all, I give it all, I give it all
'Cause you deserve everything and more (You deserve it)
I was wrong (Wrong) (You deserve everything) to ever let you go
You're the one (Oh, yeah, yeah) and I see it now (See it now)
I give it all, I give it all, I give it all, I give it all, I give it all, I give it all
'Cause you deserve everything and more, oh

[Outro: Aaron Cole, Hollyn, Both]
I'm not known for, for love
But I'll be if it [pulls you home?]
I thought I was good alone
I need you back, yeah
I'm not known for, for love
But I'll be if it [pulls you home?]
I thought I was good alone
You deserve everything and more, oh
