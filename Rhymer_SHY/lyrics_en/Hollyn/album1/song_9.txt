[Verse 1]
My mind is a bittersweet place
Always leaves a bittersweet taste
When I go there, I don't wanna stay
Let's visit on another day
But human is a tough disease, yeah, it's slowly killing me
Yeah
But there's another side existing still–spirituality

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna know You better than I did before
And I don't wanna stand here knowing that there's something more
Something more

[Chorus]
On the horizon
I keep pressing till I find You
Yeah, I know that You're out there
I hear You loudest in the silence
Lord, where are You? (where are You?)
You're takin' me to only God knows where
But I know that I'll find You
Yeah, on the horizon (on the horizon)

[Post-Chorus]
Your beauty is a sweet dream but it's only killing me
Hmm, yeah

[Verse 2]
Daddy always told me, "You're going places"
But it's hard when you don't know what place is your home anymore
Hmm
And momma told me, "Life is always changing
And the only way you're gonna make it
Just keep your eyes on the shore"
On the shore, on the shore

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna know You better than I did before
And I don't wanna stand here knowing that there's something more
Something more

[Chorus]
On the horizon
I keep pressing till I find You
Yeah, I know that You're out there
I hear You loudest in the silence
Lord, where are You? (where are You?)
You're takin' me to only God knows where
But I know that I'll find You
Yeah, on the horizon (on the horizon)

[Post-Chorus]
Your beauty is a sweet dream but it's only killing me
Hmm, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
And the sun rise, the sun rises in the morning (yeah)
And my soul's eyes, yeah, my soul's eyes finally see (I see, yeah)
Your beauty in everything (in everything)
You're closer than I can dream (I can dream)
You're standing right in front of me
Ooh-whoa-whoa-whoa

[Chorus]
On the horizon
I keep pressing till I find You
Yeah, I know that You're out there (out there, yeah)
I hear You loudest in the silence
Lord, where are You? (where are You)
You're takin' me to only God knows where (only God knows where)
Yeah, I know that I'll find You (oh, I'll find You)
On the horizon (oh)

[Outro]
What do you see on the horizon?
Where are your dreams? (What are your dreams? What do you see?)
On the horizon
Horizon
Oh yeah, You're shining so bright, so bright, yeah
On the horizon
Take me deeper than I've been
On the horizon
