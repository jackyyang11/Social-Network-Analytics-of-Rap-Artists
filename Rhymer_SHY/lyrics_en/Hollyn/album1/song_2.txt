[Intro]
1, 2, 3, 4

[Verse 1]
Everyday on my mind, and I just can't get you out
I just want you, all of you, all to myself, yeah-eh-ah
Never wanna let this go, boy we got something real
Might be a selfish, but I just don't care
I swear

[Chorus]
I just want you right here (right here)
Always by my side
You and me together
Baby, it's paradise
We can go wherever (ever)
Leave them all behind
I'm giving you all my
Gi-giving you all my love
Gi-giving you all my
Gi-giving you all my love
Gi-giving you all my
Gi-giving you all my love

[Verse 2]
Nothing's ever been so easy, I can't help but say
You got me in my feels
Got me feeling some type of way, ay-ay-ayyy
Take away, take away, take away-ay-ay
You can take everything
As long as you are with me
It'll be okay

[Chorus]
I just want you right here (right here)
Always by my side
You and me together
Baby, it's paradise
We can go wherever (ever)
Leave them all behind
I'm giving you all my
Gi-giving you all my love
Gi-giving you all my
Gi-giving you all my love
Gi-giving you all my
Gi-giving you all my love

[Bridge]
I've been waiting (I've been waiting)
I've been waiting (I-I've been waiting)
I've been waiting (I've been waiting)
For a love like this
I've been waiting
I've been waiting (I've been waiting)
I've been waiting (I-I've been waiting)
I've been waiting
For a love like this! ...

[Chorus]
I just want you right here (right here)
Always by my side
You and me together
Baby, it's paradise
We can go wherever (ever)
Leave them all behind
I'm giving you all my
Gi-giving you all my love

[Outro]
All my, all my love
Gi-giving you all my
All my, all my love
Gi-giving you all my love
All my, all my love
Gi-giving you all my
All my, all my love
I'm giving you all my love
