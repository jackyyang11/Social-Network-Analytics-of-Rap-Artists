I miss going out, feeling kinda stuck these days (loving you)
And I be on the highway, if only I could leave my place (loving you)
I used to be a talker but I ain't got nothing good to say (loving you)
I been trying to hide but its written all over my face

I really thought you were the one, the only one
I guess that I was wrong

If everything I thought
What do you do after love?
What can you say when its said and done (nothing at all)
Cuz you can't stop a heart break
And you can't stop your tears from falling down
So what do you do? what do you do?
After love

I remember first day that I saw her face
The feeling I had sorta felt like my birthday
Beautiful I must say
She was my earthquake
Cute face, nice shape, you made my earth shake
I'mma try keep the faith, do it like the church say
She the one for me and I don't care I hear my heart say
Thought I had a home run
But I guess at first base I found out the long run
Just another heart break
So how much can my heart take
You was like air to me
You know I wouldn't leave, I needed you to breath
See life is but a dream
So its more then I believe
If you ever been in love you will know what I mean
So god help me please I wanna see the light
She keep telling me I'm wrong but I know I'm right
But try and prove wrong cos I don't wanna fight
I know I make mistakes
But still I need her in my life

[Keri]
Tell me how I'm supposed to heal this open wound
And tell me who had thought that id be trying to get over you
I'm stuck in the moment, of memories of me and you
And I can get over it, but I'm ain't sure that I want to
Because you made your bed, now you gotta lie in it
Now all the things you said don't mean a thing

I can't believe I gave you one last shot
I let it ride now baby its your stuff
Oh so leave your not good for me
It took a while to finally come to my senses

What do you do after love?
What can you say when its said and done
When its over
Cos you can't stop a heart break
And you can't stop your tears from falling down
So what do you do? what do you do?
After love

[Diddy]
This is what you made me do
Pay attention
She know who I'm talking to, and I know you listening
I think about you all the time, if not every minute
I promise hurting you was never my intention
Something bout your style, the way that you presenting her
Everything I see I ever had you was in it
I apologize for every time that you might have cried
Theres not enough words to describe how I feel inside
Guardian angel sent from the skys
I always knew you would have made a beautiful bride
And that's right
And I wish you could of stayed, so much
But I'm stuck when I betrayed your trust
You know your love is more than wearing
Dolce and gabbana, gucci and prada, trips to nevada
And I admit that you hurt probably true
But I don't mistake the only one I love is you

I love you
