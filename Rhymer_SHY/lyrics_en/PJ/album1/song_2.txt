[Verse 1]
My grind keep me awake at night
No sleep, I'll be awake at night
Money keep me awake at night
My dream keep me awake at night

[Chorus]
Don't chase these hoes
Don't chase the problem they come with
Don't chase these niggas
Cause they all say the same shit
These days, I be awake at night
My dream keep me awake at night

[Verse 2]
My grind keep me awake at night
Money keep me awake at night
My dreams keep me awake at night
No sleep, I be awake at night

[Chorus]
Don't chase these hoes
Don't chase the problem they come with
Don't chase these niggas
Cause they all say the same shit
These days, I be awake at night
No sleep, I be awake at night

[Post-Chorus]
No, no sleep
No, no sleep
No, no sleep
These days, I be awake at night
No, no sleep
No sleep, I be awake at night

[Hook]
I'll be awake at night
I'll be awake at night
I'll be awake at night
I'll be awake at night
I'll be awake at night
I'll be awake at night
I'll be awake at night
I'll be awake at night
I'll be awake at night
I'll be awake at night
I'll be awake at night
I'll be awake at night

[Verse 3]
My grind keep me awake at night
Money keep me awake at night
My dreams keep me awake at night
No sleep, I'll be awake at night

[Chorus]
Don't chase these hoes
Don't chase the problem they come with
Don't chase these niggas
Cause they all say the same shit
These days, I'll be awake at night
No sleep, I'll be awake at night

[Post-Chorus]
No, no sleep
No, no sleep

[Outro]
"So, here's a secret that I've learned
The world will never share
Love what makes you who you are
And that's what makes you rare"
