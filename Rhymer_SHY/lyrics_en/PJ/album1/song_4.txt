[Verse 1]
Oh, yeah
Why should I be ashamed?
Most girls aren't the same, no
Why should I have to choose?
From having love or pursue mine
Tell me what's in a name
Should all women be the same, no
Should I slow down, have a child
Stare at a kid with my smile? no

[Chorus]
Oh, I
I'll be forever chasin' Benjamin
Oh, I
I'll be forever chasin' Benjamin

[Verse 2]
All my friends settled down
But I'm still here grindin' now, don't
Say we want differently
When I want you, you want me, so
Uh-uh, hey, hey

[Pre-Chorus]
I want you in the passenger's side
Won't you hold me down
Why I keep driving it's your choice
No matter where you go
I'm moving o-o-on
Moving o-o-on

[Chorus]
Oh, I
I'll be forever chasin' Benjamin
No lie
I'll be forever chasin' Benjamin
Oh, I
I'll be forever chasin' Benjamin
'Til I die, baby
I'll be forever cha-chasin' Benjamin

[Bridge]
25 and I really wanna change the world
Tryna change my life, wanna do some things
25 and I really wanna change the world
Wanna change my life, tryna do some things
Oh, it's funny
Cause Disney didn't put this shit in the movies
No-oh, no-oh
Snow White wasn't a damsel in a kitchen
At home washing dishes, not at all
At all

[Chorus]
Oh, I
I'll be forever chasin' Benjamin
No lie
I'll be forever chasin' Benjamin
Oh, I
I'll be forever chasin' Benjamin
'Til I die, baby
I'll be forever cha-chasin' Benjamin
Chasin' Benjamin

[Outro]
La-la-la
La-la-a-la la
La-la-la-a-a
'Til I die
I'll be forever chasin' Benjamin
