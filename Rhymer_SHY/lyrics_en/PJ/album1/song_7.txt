[Intro]
Cold, cold, ice cold
Cold, ice, ice cold

[Verse 1]
Ain't it crazy how I'm still here?
By the way, it happened last year
Ain't it crazy how I'm not scared?
I got it where I want, yeah

[Chorus]
And all I need is a lil time
All I need is some friends of mine
I'm always gonna be good, yeah
You can't stop what's ice cold

[Verse 2]
Think I'm going to the top, yeah
You can disagree but I don't care
Got more soul and I got flair
Do it for the ones that are still scared

[Chorus]
And all I need is a lil time
All I need is some friends of mine
I'm always gonna be good, yeah
You can't stop what's ice cold
