[Chorus: Jamila Woods]
Why, why, why why
Why, why, why why
Why, why, why why, why, why

[Verse: Jamila Woods]
Rain so hot in the neighbourhood
My love don't call when she said she would
Friends who come don't stay for good, no, no, no
Why?
Pigs want take black mama's kids
Bible say we all from the same rib
But some of us go to heaven too soon
Why some of us get to heaven too soon

[Chorus: Jamila Woods]
Why, why, why why
Why, why, why why
Why, why, why why, why, why
