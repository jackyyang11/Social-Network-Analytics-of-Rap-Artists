[Hook: Eryn Allen Kane, Jesse Boykins III, & Lili K.]
Please don't go, don't go, don't go, don't go
Please don't go, don't go, don't go, don't go
Please don't go, don't go, don't go, don't go
Please don't go, don't go, don't go, don't go

[Verse 1: Mike Golden]
I never meant to leave (don't go, don't go), but girl I gotta go
Selfish it may be, but know my heart ain’t cold
I got some things to see, but tonight, get on the floor
Better yet, jump on the board, Surf's up this wave gon' take us all
From city, to city, from the GO, to Cali, to Paris
In my dreams, once I'm lifted you would know
You needed to go let me see, go let me eat, be MG
I'ma come back just to show you the air
That you never will breathe without me

[Hook: Eryn Allen Kane, Jesse Boykins III, Lili K., & Mike Golden]
Please don't go, don't go, don't go, don't go
Please don't go, don't go, don't go, don't go
Please don't go, don't go, don't go, don't go
Please don't go, don't go, don't go, don't go

[Bridge]
You should never go away
You should never go away
You should never go away
You should never go away

[Verse 2: Joey Purp]
Uh, you remind me of one of these girls
Or should I say one of these hoes
You could be a playmate girl, a centerfold
In the mirror working on your magazine cover pose
All you really want is credit cards, billboards
Magazines, movie screens, money rolls
You really are the shit that you see, huh?
You know you only see what they show you
I could show you something different baby girl
Sometimes the bullshit glisten baby girl
Standing in the club with your eyebrows furrowed
Secondhand watch on so you know your time's borrowed
I don't really mean to look at you the wrong way
But did the couple free shots get you home, bae?
When you woke up were you still in the wrong place?
Guess the little money that he spent on drinks done went a long way
Now gon' get your panties out the hallway
Twelve missed calls what your phone say
On the ride home you still take the long way
Had to blame it all on the alcohol like the song say
Damn, guess you should have listened to the man
Now you done gon' and went missing on the man
Sharks in the water still fishing for the man
Surf's up, smoke something, Young Purple, I'm the man uh

[Hook: Eryn Allen Kane, Jesse Boykins III, Lili K., & Mike Golden]
Please don't go, don't go, don't go, don't go
Please don't go, don't go, don't go, don't go
Please don't go, don't go, don't go, don't go
Please don't go, don't go, don't go, don't go

[Outro]
Surf's up, Surf's up
Surf's up, Surf's up
Surf's up, Surf's up
Surf's up
