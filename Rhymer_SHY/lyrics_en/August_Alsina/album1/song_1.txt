[Verse 1: August Alsina]
See me, I ain't never been no whack nigga
I never that nigga, I was in the trap nigga
I see your girl choosing, I'mma rap with her
If I get to her the crib, it's a wrap nigga
She called me so I can beat it up
I got your girl hooked, now she can't get enough
I ain't got a legs wide in the back of my truck
Then her ass on the inside when I bust my nut
Oh that's your homie and how you drove
Talking that shit, nigga don't get stoked
Bitch what? I'll bust ya ass up
Don't even go there boy cause I'm ready to mans up

[Hook: August Alsina]
You don't want to fuck with me

[Verse 2: August Alsina]
Black on black, 150 yeah I copped that
In the front of the club is where I parked at
Hat to the back, snaps in the front
Sipping on Ciroc, puffing on a blunt
Niggas checking ID, so I gotta get lost
Head to the crib when I get a phone call
Never been the one to brag 'bout the hoes I got
But when I'm finished with that ass, she say this boy hot

[Hook: August Alsina]
You don't want to fuck with me

If I ain't a hot boy, then what do you call that?
I bet you I'll show them niggas this boy hot

[Verse 3: August Alsina]
That's it, I done had enough
Niggas talking crazy, hot starting to fuss
Boy look, nigga don't play no games no more
Nigga'll bust ya head if you bang his throat
Nigga please, I'm always strapped
And we can bang bang or rat ta tat tat
And you can lay it down on the ground, face flat
Thinking you a bad boy in this bitch, chase that
I heard about the cash, that's a nice chain
And for the right price, I'll bust the right brain
All this for a hoe, nigga so lame
Got you thinking she the one, nigga trifling
Give me head while we driving down the fast lane
Look back when I hit it from the back mane
Got her bragging to her girls 'bout the dick game
And when you hit it she be yelling out my name, August

[Hook: August Alsina]
If I ain't a hot boy, then what do you call that?
I bet you I'll show them niggas this boy hot

[Verse 3: Lucci Lou]
You see me, I'm getting free shit and toss that
New Jaguar, black on black, nigga I bought that
Called 'em in charge, bitch I fall back
Tired of going hard, I brought the soft back
Lucci, that's a nice chain
Reach for it, fuck around and lose your life mane
Like niggas do the right thing
I be laying in the box of the choir saying
Let me get the keys to the Audi truck
Wife new sentence, niggas daughtered up
New Maccie loving can't a nigga follow us
Oh these bitches just mad cause the bitches swallow us
Boy look, nigga don't play no games no more
Nigga'll bust your head and still bang your hoe
Shit, I'm always strapped
Thinking you a bad boy, well nigga take that

[Hook: August Alsina]
You don't want to fuck with me
You don't want to fuck with me
