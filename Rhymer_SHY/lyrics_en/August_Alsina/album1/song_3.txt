Yeah, Breezy

Hook:
You should be here with me, touching me constantly
I should be f*cking you, all night, (all night)
You should be telling me, how deep that thing should be
All while I'm f*cking you so right, (so right)
Cause I've been thinking bout it all day, (day)
Everything that I'm gone do
So hurry up, stop playing
I know you want it so slide through
Cause you should be here with me, touching me constantly
I should be f*cking you, all night, all night

What's poppin', right? all jokes aside
Your man ain't home, let's f*ck tonight
I got the text, don't play with me
I'm at the W, for two nights come stay with me
I'm kissing you, you kissing me
I'm missing you, you missing me
Champagne, couple candles lit
I'm a grow ass man I can handle that
Let me rub you down, smoke a couple
Run some water, pour some bubbles
And throw you in, wash you off, take you out
(Then what) dry you off, lay you down, wear you out
And all I need for you to do, cooperate, (damn)
And I can be your doctor, let me operate, (damn)
I go so deep off in that, that her legs shake
We're f*cking till the bed break

[Hook:]

Still taking my time, kissing her high, licking her low
I can tell by her eyes, she's feeling the vibe, it's turning her on
She cute in the face, thick in the waist, I'm hugging them hips
She's curling her toes, I enter her. (ahh) , she's biting her lips
She got some nice nice not to tight just right, (right)
I'm talking wet wet, gushy, all night night
She watched me pushed it in and pulled it out
She's from up north, but love them niggas from the south
Hittin' her from the back, making that ass clap
All in the air, pulling her hair, making that ass tap (what) out
And girl you know what I'm talking a(what)bout
The things I do is guaranteed to make you shout
So baby come over, let's take it there
And whatever you wanting to go I can take you there
But now I gotta leave, but won't be gone too long
Cause all that I keep thinking about is the hook to this song

[Hook:]
