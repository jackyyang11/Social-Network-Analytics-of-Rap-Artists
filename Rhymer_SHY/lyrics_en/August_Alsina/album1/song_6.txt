[Verse 1]
Pull up to the crib, beep the horn and we gone
Hop up in the whip, girl it's on 'til the morn'
I was thinking I would take you to your favourite spot
But you was ready so we never left the parking lot
You climbing in the back, I'm right behind ya
The tint so dark, I'm hoping I can find ya
But that's the way that you like it, so nobody see inside
You remind me of my truck, I love the way you ride
And she loves the way that I drive, she get there automatic
But shawty works the stick, love the way that she grab it
And all you hear is moaning, ain't no talking when I freak her
Now this car is rocking cause we banging like my speakers

[Hook]
We in the back seat, ah yeah we back at it
We in the back seat, she looking back at it
We in the back seat, ah yeah we back at it
We in the back seat, she looking back at it
We be in the back seat, we be in the back seat
We be in the back seat, we be in the back seat
We in the back seat, ah yeah we back at it
We in the back seat, she looking back at it

[Verse 2]
No training wheels so hold on, baby girl don't fall off
Your body is my car wash, I'mma get it all off
You love when I talk that ratchet, I can tell by your headlight
You're sending all the signals then come and get this tailpipe
So you can get exhausted, crunk it up and she lost it
And now I got her so turnt, she don't want to get off it
I told her that this ride would get her to her destination
She told me that this D train is her only transportation

[Hook]
We in the back seat, ah yeah we back at it
We in the back seat, she looking back at it
We in the back seat, ah yeah we back at it
We in the back seat, she looking back at it
We be in the back seat, we be in the back seat
We be in the back seat, we be in the back seat
We in the back seat, ah yeah we back at it
We in the back seat, she looking back at it
