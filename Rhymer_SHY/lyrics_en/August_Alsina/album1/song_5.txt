[Chorus]
Yeah I hear you, you talking
And you walking, are you barking
I hear you talking baby but I hope that you back it up
I hear you talking baby but I hope that you back it up
Yeah I hear you, you talking
And you walking, are you barking
I hear you talking baby but I hope that you back it up
I hear you talking baby but I hope that you back it up

[Verse 1]
If I die young, who gon' miss me?
All this money, who gon' spend it?
When I lose my cool, who gon' call me?
When they cock and shoot, will you warn me?
If I'm in danger, who gon' holler?
Be my rider, if there's a problem
Be my baby mama, without the drama
Be honest (Uhh)

[Pre-Chorus]
I ain't talking 'bout, a basic bitch
I'm talking 'bout the one that go, when I say the shit
She bring me high for the low, Feet to the floor
And when it's time to get it crackin', Shawty overdose

[Chorus]
Yeah I hear you, you talking
And you walking, are you barking
I hear you talking baby but I hope that you back it up
I hear you talking baby but I hope that you back it up
Yeah I hear you, you talking
And you walking, are you barking
I hear you talking baby but I hope that you back it up
I hear you talking baby but I hope that you back it up

[Verse 2]
Anything that I need, will you be the one [?]
Fuck the haters, it's just us, come hold me down
For infinity I swear, baby I ain't talking chemistry
I need a [?] you're feeling me
Yeah, be my remedy (Uhh)

[Pre-Chorus]
I ain't talking 'bout, a basic bitch
I'm talking 'bout the one that go, when I say the shit
She bring me high for the low, Feet to the floor
And when it's time to get it crackin', Shawty overdose

[Chorus]
Yeah I hear you, you talking
And you walking, are you barking
I hear you talking baby but I hope that you back it up
I hear you talking baby but I hope that you back it up
Yeah I hear you, you talking
And you walking, are you barking
I hear you talking baby but I hope that you back it up
I hear you talking baby but I hope that you back it up
