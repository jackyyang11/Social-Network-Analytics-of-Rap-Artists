You can walk away from all of this
Or you can let me show you around the wreckage
Some of this is harder to admit to talk about but I am trying

Giving in is harder to resist
Feeling like a boat without an anchor
Stolen silent kisses feel like quiet promises that I’ll be fine

And I am trying to pull away from this bed but it hasn’t happened yet
And I lie when I say I’ll never go back ‘cause it hasn’t worked like that
So hate me if you want to you can blame me
If it helps you breaking up your family while the siren wakes the baby it’s all right
Whatever helps you sleep at night
Whatever helps you sleep at night

And I’m not sure how you are taking in this
Playing with a tiny piece of paper
Scared to see my lying eyes are the only eyes not telling lies now

And I have got my feelings from the mess
But none of them will save you from your madness
‘Cause he was in my body while his words were in your hands
Somewhere across the ocean trusting him

And I am trying to pull away from this bed but it hasn’t happened yet
And I lie when I say I’ll never go back ‘cause it hasn’t worked like that
So hate me if you want to you can blame me
If it helps you breaking up your family while the siren wakes the baby it’s all right
Whatever helps you sleep at night
Whatever helps you sleep at night

And I am trying to pull away from this bed but it hasn’t happened yet
And I lie when I say I’ll never go back ‘cause it hasn’t worked like that
So hate me if you want to you can blame me
If it helps you breaking up your family while the siren wakes the baby it’s all right
Whatever helps you sleep at night
Whatever helps you sleep at night
