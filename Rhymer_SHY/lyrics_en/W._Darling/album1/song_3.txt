[Chorus]
I'll keep waving
Til my hand doesn't stand for goodbye
Oh, I won't stop waiting
Til you come home again
And my hand doesn't stand for goodbye

[Verse 1]
Feet on the ground
Like the flowers you planted
The ones that you left at my side
The grass hasn't changed
It's the same as you left it
But all of the roses have died

[Pre-Chorus]
I turn around
Thinking you'll say it's just a dream
Every day
Since the day you had to leave

[Chorus]
Oh but I keep waving
Til my hand doesn't stand for goodbye
Oh I won't stop waving
Til you come home again
And my hand doesn't stand for goodbye

[Verse 2]
Covered in dust
Empty chairs, empty tables
Where we used to dream of a life
You in the garden with dirt on your hands
While I watch as the day turns to night

[Pre-Chorus]
Look around
Everything's perfect
I didn't move a thing
I couldn't change a thing
Out of faith
Out of patience and hope
Hope

[Chorus]
Oh but I keep waving
Til my hand doesn't stand for goodbye
Oh I won't stop waving
Til you come home again
And my hand doesn't stand for goodbye
Til you come home again
And my hand doesn't stand for goodbye
