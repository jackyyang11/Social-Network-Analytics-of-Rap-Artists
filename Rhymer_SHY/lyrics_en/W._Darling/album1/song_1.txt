[Verse 1]
I see you far, far across the room and I can barely move, oh
I look away, lost in the view cause I don't even know you
And now you're walking, you're walking over, and I can hardly breathe
My heart is racing, as if I'm pacing, but I can hardly speak

[Chorus]
And are you feeling alright, cause I just got so dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, oh
And are you feeling alright, cause my head got so heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy
And I can't even see you straight when you look at me like this, me like this, oh
And now you're feeling alright, cause I just got so dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, dizzy

[Verse 2]
I can't explain, you walked out of a scene from my memory, oh
Now every face is only filling space, and pulling you to me, oh
And now your hands are coming closer, and I can hardly breathe
And now your lips are moving slower, to say my name to me

[Chorus]
And are you feeling alright, cause I just got so dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, oh
And are youfeeling alright, cause my head got so heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy
And I can't even see you straight when you look at me like this, me like this, oh
And are you feeling alright, cause I just got so dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, dizzy

[Bridge]
And no, nothing moves before your touch, the ones that's still without your love
A simple look, is such a rush, it's such a rush

[Outro]
And are you feeling alright, cause I just got so dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, oh
And are you feeling alright, cause my head got so heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy
Heavy

[Chorus]
And are you feeling alright, cause I just got so dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, oh
And are you feeling alright, cause my head got so heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy
And I can't even see you straight when you look at me like this, me like this, oh
And are you feeling alright, cause I just got so dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, oh
