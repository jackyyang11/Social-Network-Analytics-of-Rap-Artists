[Verse 1]
Beautiful lights shine like champions
But I find the fault in the stars
Cause I'm so caught up hunting happiness
That I cannot see it's hunting me

The moment I start feeling comfortable
I hear a voice in my head
Fast cars paint guides on the pavement
And say "don't look back, find greener grass"

[Chorus]
The road to paradise is easy to pass
And you'll never see the sign if you're moving too fast
I'm so caught up hunting happiness
I move so quickly that it can't catch me
Ooooooh, ooooh

[Verse 2]
Show me a shot of a miracle
And I'll find the dirt on the frame
It's easier chasing a fantasy
Than trusting your heart won't rip mine apart

[Chorus]
The road to paradise is easy to pass
And you'll never see the sign if you're moving too fast
I'm so caught up hunting happiness
I move so quickly that it can't catch me
Ooooooh, ooooh
Ooooooh, ooooh
Ooooooh, ooooh
Ooooooh, ooooh

[Bridge]
If I could stay still
Just for a minute
I'd find myself in it

If I could see clear
And count all my blessings
Instead of the seconds
Ooohh

[Chours]
The road to paradise is easy to pass
And you'll never see the sign if you're moving to fast
Oh, I'm so caught up hunting happiness
I move so quickly that it can't catch me
Ooooooh, ooooh
Ooooooh, ooooh
Ooooooh, ooooh
Ooooooh, ooooh
