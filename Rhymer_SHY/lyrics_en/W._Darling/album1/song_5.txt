[Verse 1]
Right here, face to face in your sheets
We're tucked underneath all these city street lights
Where everything starts with your kiss
Didn't I do it all for the nights like this

So I built up a home in your chest
You gave me the space, so I put my bags down
Now empty, with boxes unpacked
I didn't know it was a month-to-month rent

[Bridge]
Didn't I keep hoping that your heart would stay open
For more than the night
Didn't I, didn't I
And when you said you're sorry, it was a likely story
But I ran to your side like a ghost in the night

[Chorus]
When the light is so bright
You get a little bit, little bit blinded
When you're lifted so high
Your falling feels like flying
When you're lost in those eyes
Feels like you might be gone forever
So, one last kiss then let it end on a night like this
On a night like this
On a night like this
On a night like this

[Verse 2]
With your hands held up over my eyes
All the dark looks like some kind of starry sky
But we're on the edge of a burning high-rise
And you know that I, I did it all just to lose your grip

[Bridge]
But didn't I keep hoping that the truth meant nothing
I heard what you said, but I know what you did
Didn't I keep trying, even when your lies were lying
Like a thorn in my side, every time, didn't I?

[Chorus]
When the light is so bright
You get a little bit, little bit blinded
When you're lifted so high
Your falling feels like flying
When you're lost in those eyes
Feels like you might be gone forever
So, one last kiss then let it end on a night like this
On a night like this
On a night like this
On a night like this

[Bridge]
Didn't I keep hoping that the truth meant nothing
I heard what you said but I know what you did

[Chorus]
When the light is so bright
You get a little bit, little bit blinded
When you're lifted so high
Your falling feels like flying
When you're lost in those eyes
Feels like you might be gone forever
So, one last kiss then let it end on a night like this
On a night like this
On a night like this
On a night like this
