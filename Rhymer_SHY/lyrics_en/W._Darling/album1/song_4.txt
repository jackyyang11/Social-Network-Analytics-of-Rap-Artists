[Verse 1]
You can win every fight that you start
Never caring who you rip apart
If you don't get your way you can borrow or pay
But you're nothing till you learn to love
You've got nothing till you learn to love

[Pre-Chorus]
Until it feels like a rush of blood to your head
A rush of blood to your heart
A rush of blood to your body
Until it feels like you'd give whatever you got
You'd get whatever they want
You'd stop for no one or nothing

[Chorus]
And oh, if you give a little
You're gonna get a lot more
And oh, you're broke inside and I can feel it
Oh, I can fix what you've done
If you can learn to love

[Verse 2]
You can stand with a shield at your side
Never breaking protecting your pride
But you can't really win if you've nothing to lose
Cause you're nothing till you learn you love

[Pre-Chorus]
Until it feels like a rush of blood to your head
A rush of blood to your heart
A rush of blood to your body

[Chorus]
And oh, if you give a little
You're gonna get a lot more
And oh, you're broke inside and I can feel it
Oh, I can fix what you've done
If you can learn to love

[Pre-Chorus]
Until it feels like a rush of blood to your head
A rush of blood to your heart
A rush of blood to your body

[Chorus]
And oh, if you give a little
You're gonna get a lot more
And oh, you're broke inside and I can feel it
Oh, I can fix what you've done
If you can learn to love
