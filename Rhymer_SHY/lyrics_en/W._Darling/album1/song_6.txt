I miss you
Every morning every night
How I wish you
Would wakeup and see my sight

‘Cause I’m back home in Canada
Thinking how you’d fit here
Singing With my father, playing his guitar’s and driving to the cottage
Holding on to august, saying you were ready and you didn’t understand

And i miss you
Every Sunday afternoon
'Cause we used to take your truck to malibu

And I’m missing you from Canada
Keeping up my silence
Thinking if I’m quiet, you might find your senses and fill in all the distances
Show up at my doorstep, in a wrapped up denim and tell me you were wrong

And I’m not staying quiet to punish you. No
I just tought i might need less of you

And i miss you
Everytime i hear your name
'Cause I’m used to how it looks and sounds and taste

And I’m siting here in Silver Lake, running trought our memories
Driving trought the desert, climbings [?] mountais
I know you’re drinking whiskey. And i know you must miss me
Turning into a memorie right before your eyes

And I’m not staying quiet to punish you
I just tought i might need less of you
And I’m not stay6ing quiet to punish you
I just tought i might need less of you
