[Verse 1]
Our history is only stories and lies
I wanna write something new and we'll read it
Oh your hands are only inches from mine
I wanna feel what you feel when you feel it

[Pre-Chorus]
‘Cause we're tiny, pieces fitting gently
Covered up so barely
Scrapes and bruises aside

[Chorus]
Oh we're just skeletons, we're so easy to break
And our bones are crumbling
Jumping off mountains in roller skates
I'm reckless, and careless
Bloody knees in my jeans and my sundresses
So delicate
Oh skeletons
Oh we're skeletons

[Verse 2]
Oh your lips are only inches from mine
As you talk 'bout the life you've been leading
And I can't turn away from, turn away from you
I wanna feel what you feel when you feel it

[Pre-Chorus]
‘Cause we're tiny, pieces fitting gently
Covered up so barely
Scrapes and bruises aside/inside

[Chorus]
Oh we're just skeletons, we're so easy to break
And our bones are crumbling
Jumping off mountains in roller skates
I'm reckless, and careless
Bloody knees in my jeans and my sundresses
So delicate
Oh the skeletons
Oh the skeletons

[Bridge]
‘Cause we're tiny, pieces fitting gently
Covered up so barely
These scrapes and bruises are/of mine
It's only muscle wrapped in memory
Keeping me this steady when your lips are inches from mine

[Chorus]
‘Cause we're just skeletons, we're so easy to break
And our bones are crumbling
Jumping off mountains in roller skates
I'm reckless, and careless
Bloody knees in my jeans and my sundresses
So delicate, ohhhh the skeletons
Oh we're skeletons
Oh we're skeletons
(Skeletons)
(Skeletons)
Oh we're skeletons
Oh
