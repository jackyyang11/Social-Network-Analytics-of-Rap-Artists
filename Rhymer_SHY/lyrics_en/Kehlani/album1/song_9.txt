[Verse 1]
In my head every time I take a step it's on the clouds
Feeling like a whole lot of power and I don't need a crown
Cause you know the royals you never get to fall in love anyways
And if you couldn't tell I'm falling even more everyday
And every time you kiss me I hear a song
When you look at me it's like nothing's ever wrong
Maybe I'm bad for living in the fantasy
One where you're almost as in love with me

[Hook]
As I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, with you
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, baby baby
As I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, with you

[Verse 2]
Can you put those hands on my body and baby just feel me?
If I gave you the chance to hold my soul would you just feel me, see the real me?
Cause I love that if you do
I would owe all my happiness to you
If you couldn't tell baby my smile has been brand new, yeah
And every time you kiss me I hear a song
When you look at me it's like nothing's ever wrong
Maybe I'm bad for living in the fantasy
One where you're almost as in love with me

[Hook]
As I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, with you
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, baby baby
As I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, with you

I can love you, I can love you
I can love you, better than she can
I can love you, I can love you
I can love you, better than she can

[Hook]
As I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, with you
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, baby baby
As I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, with you
