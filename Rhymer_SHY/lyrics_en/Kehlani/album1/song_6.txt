[Verse 1]
I love that you're confident
Never wanna take nothing away from that
From that yeah
I love all your honesty
Just met you but probably could state the fact yeah
You know I'm looking for more, you know I'm searching for more than  the surface
You know I'm looking forward, you know I'm out of order

[Chorus]
We're at this halfway point between what it is and what it seems
I'm all in if you're all in baby
We're at this halfway point between what we say and what we mean
I'm all in if you're all in baby

[Verse 2]
Don't want a come in the way of you and your day to day, I know that's your shit
I don't wanna take away or ever distract you bae from what your doing
But you know that I got goals and you know that I know my role, can't nothing stop me
And you know I hate control but I know you hate it more

[Chorus]
We're at this halfway point between what it is and what it seems
I'm all in if you're all in baby
We're at this halfway point between what we say and what we mean
I'm all in if you're all in baby
