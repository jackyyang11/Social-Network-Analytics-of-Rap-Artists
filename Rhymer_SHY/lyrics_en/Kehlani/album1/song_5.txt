[Verse 1: Kehlani]
Rain is good for the soul
Crazy how I feel the most warm when it's cold
Drops hit the window and I drop down to the floor
I assume this is when I would miss you the most
I'm lying down
I've got this notepad where you laid your head
We use to go round and round
Making love in my bed
We were in so deep
We could barely tread
But now I found a way to heal myself instead

[Chorus: Kehlani]
And damn I feel alive
Baby, damn I feel alive
It's like something has to die
To help you realize—damn I feel alive

[Verse 2: Kehlani]
We were in a weird place
Crazy how a person you love could just change
Now I am learning to realize we needed our space
I could never hurt you, we use to be great
And you use to say, what goes around comes around so fast
Now just look at the way
I'm moving on and you stuck in the past
I deserve a love that is gonna last
But until then I will just raise this glass

[Chorus: Kehlani]
And damn I feel alive
Baby, damn I feel alive
It's like something has to die
To help you realize—damn I feel alive

[Bridge: Kehlani]
I feel, I feel
Turn this song up if you feel alive
I feel, you feel
Let it all go cause right now's the time
Let go, live on
So you can be free, yeah free to fly
I know it's hard but it's worth it

[Chorus: Kehlani]
And damn I feel alive
Baby, damn I feel alive
It's like something has to die
To help you realize—damn I feel alive
