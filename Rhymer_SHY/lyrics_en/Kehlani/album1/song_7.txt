[Hook]
I already won
I got the keys to my hood
Mama say she good
Doing what I should (I already won)
I got the world on my back
City on the map
No time to kick back (I already)
Stopped giving a damn about
When they tell me how I won't make it out
I already won
I already, I already won

[Verse 1]
Took the road less traveled
Yeah, I'm tired
But I'm so far from the ending
Every day I'm evolving
The world keep turning
And God keep giving
Oh Goddamn, fuck a handout
Unless I got my hands out
Then I still stand out
Damn yeah, I make them bands now
Bet I got plans now and I'm still—

[Pre-Hook]
Gracious in the way I move
And I treat it like I want it to
And I never got you comfortable always
And I'm thankful that I found my groove
And I'm humble, but I got the juice
I remain unstoppable always

[Hook]
I already won
I got the keys to my hood
Mama say she good
Doing what I should (I already won)
I got the world on my back
City on the map
No time to kick back (I already)
Stopped giving a damn about
When they tell me how I won't make it out
I already won
I already, I already won

[Verse 2]
I'm nominated for a Grammy, AMAs, and BET Awards
Man, what an honor
Never dreamed I'd do all this before
But you can't put a worth up on my art
That's my story, that's my heart
That's my soul, fuck the fame
Keep the glory
'Cause I made it out a city that ain't pretty
And it's tricky when you wanna show me love
Because it's trendy, shit be iffy
If you love me when I'm up
It's cause you see when I'm down
And only God can hand rewards
Or even give someone a crown
Because the critics bleed like I bleed
They eat like I eat
I don't put you above me
Cause you gotta judge how I sing
Get to judge how I speak
Even judge how I breathe
Just two years ago
Yeah, you were sitting right in my seat
Starving hungry like me
So empathize beside me
Understand I'm highly favored
Fuck your favors—yeah, I got me

[Hook]
I already won
I got the keys to my hood
Mama say she good
Doing what I should (I already won)
I got the world on my back
City on the map
No time to kick back (I already)
Stopped giving a damn about
When they tell me how I won't make it out
I already won
I already, I already won

[Outro]
I already won
I've already
I already won
I've already won
Already wo-uh-on
