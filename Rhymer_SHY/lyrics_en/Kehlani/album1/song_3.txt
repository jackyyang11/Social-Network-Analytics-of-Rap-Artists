[Verse 1]
You have a way with words
Your silence is a curse
You always seem to break me down, down, down
My swollen heart you curve
Your comfort makes it worse
I don't want you around, 'round, 'round, 'round

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause how is the man of my dreams
Not a man of his words?
And how is the man for me
Just a man that makes me hurt?

[Chorus]
It's time to take my own
Take my own advice, take my own advice
Need me to take my own
Take my own advice, take my own advice

[Verse 2]
I almost lost my mind, yeah
I left myself behind, yeah
I almost crashed and fell right from the sky
I took a chance on this, yeah
I took too big a risk, yeah
And now I’m left with pain to get me high

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause how is the man of my dreams
Not a man of his words?
And how is the man for me
Just a man that makes me hurt?

[Chorus]
It's time to take my own
Take my own advice, take my own advice
Need me to take my own
Take my own advice, take my own advice

[Bridge]
You had to break me, take me, to make me better
But I had to save me, baby, now or never

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause how is the man of my dreams
Not a man of his words?
And how is the man for me
Just a man that makes me hurt?

[Chorus]
It's time to take my own
Take my own advice, take my own advice
Need me to take my own
Take my own advice, take my own advice

[Outro]
Take, own, ooh, ooh
Take, own, ooh, ooh
