Breathe in the life
Fill us with water
We're taking it farther and farther
See, Momma can't make it right
Don't look to your Father
We need to be smarter and smarter

This won't happen twice
So don't even bother
Were taking it farther and farther

See, freedom comes with a price
But that's just a part of life
'Said, that's just a part of life

It's coming. I can see for miles
Head towards the light
We own the night

We're done playing nice
So don't be a martyr
We've got to be harder and harder

We came here to fight
And that's just a part of life
'Said, thats just a part of life

It's coming. I can see for miles
Head towards the light
We own the night

Everyday you're always fighting for something
Everything you never see is coming
It'll find you
It'll find you
You're running out
You're running out
