Doo, doo, doo-doo doo-doo (x4)
I race my feet
I miss a beat
Throw my seat
Don't care, get off my back
I make a sound
I wash down
Around, so round
Get off, don't touch my stack
Come step outside
To shoot me high
'Cause i'm about to crack
1,2,3, Turnaround
Don't you watch me now
Just turnaround
Touch your knees, don't look
Just turnound
Do it now--don't make me count to 4
1,2,3, Turnaround
Watch yourself
Why don't you turnound
Can't you see
I don't need you around
Do it now--walk right through that door
Doo, doo, doo-doo doo-doo (x2)
Who could it--
Please, don't look at me
So obviously
It makes me sweat
Straight to my head
I'm turning reddish, someone said
So i'm upset
Come step outside
To shoot me high
Oh, before I forget...
1,2,3, Turnaround
Don't you watch me now
Just turnaround
Touch your knees, don't look
Just turnound
Do it now--don't make me count to 4
1,2,3, Turnaround
Watch yourself
Why don't you turnound
Can't you see
I don't need you around
Do it now--walk right through that door
Doo, doo, doo-doo doo-doo (x4)
Somebody take this, please
Alright, alright, hey, hey, hey, ay ay, ay, ok, ok
We're unannounced
So shut your mouth
We can do it now
If you make it fast
My head is wired
I'm so damn tired
I hope that this feeling lasts
1,2,3, Turnaround
Don't you watch me now
Just turnaround
Touch your knees, don't look
Just turnound
Do it now--don't make me count to 4
1,2,3, Turnaround
Watch yourself
Why don't you turnound
Can't you see
I don't need you around
Do it now--walk right through that door
1,2,3 (Doo, doo, doo-doo doo-doo)
Don't you watch me (Doo, doo, doo-doo doo-doo)
Turn around
Do it now--walk right through that door
1,2,3 (Doo, doo, doo-doo doo-doo)
Come on watch me (Doo, doo, doo-doo doo-doo)
Hmmmmm do it now
Walk right through that door
