[Verse 1]
From Mexico, living in Arizona
Drink Pacifico and cheap tequila
Dance to the beat of the drum, she was beautiful as Mona Lisa
¿De dónde vienes, you loca latina?

[Bridge]
She said there's things that you don't want to know about me, yeah
Don't you know I'm not like anybody, yeah
That's exactly why you think it is you want me
But the thing is I'm already with somebody

[Chorus]
Angelica, Angelica
You married a man to move to America
Angelica, Angelica, see
We can run away from it all and move to Canada

[Verse 2]
As much as I would love for you to stay inside me
She said my friends are waiting in the hotel lobby, oh no
Don't leave me, don't leave me
Te amo Mami
Even if you got it I just say you want me

[Chorus]
Angelica, Angelica
You married a man to move to America
Angelica, Angelica
We can run away from it all and go to Canada

Angelica, Angelica
Married a man to move to America
Angelica, Angelica
We can run away from it all and go to Canada

[Verse 3]
You're not just saying who knows when we'll see each other again
Don't get in your head, you know our love will transcend
Before my cover gets blown, gotta get going
Know I wish we could pretend
Yeah she called on the phone, before she got home
This ain't how it has to end

[Chorus]
Angelica, Angelica
You know we don't have to stay, stay in America
Angelica, Angelica
Don't you just take my hand, run away to Canada
