Always somethin', can't it just be right?
Lord knows, it's always somethin', can't it just be right?
Wish someone would tell me why
Why I waste my time workin' day and night
When it's never right
Never get nothin', never get nothin' right
'Cause it's always somethin', makes me wonder why, why I even try
'Cause it's a cold, cold world out there
And my faith is runnin' dry, nothing's ever right

I ain't got no time to... time to play around
When everyone around me is tryna bring me down
I know
See they just never get nothin' right
And that just ain't my type
Don't expect a thing from no one
'Cause they can never get nothin' right

I'm always bustin' my ass
Just tryin' to get by
Said what you know about that life?
Came from nothin'
Now people wanna hitch a ride
Always think they're sly
Why don't you go live your car for a while?
And tell me if you survive

I've been out here roughin' it, player
For a very very long time
You know I'm out here roughin' it, player
You know I gotta get mine, all the time
See, this might be out of your wheelhouse
But I stay on my grind, all the time

I ain't got no time to... time to play around
When everyone around me is tryna bring me down
I know
See they just never get nothin' right
And that just ain't my type
Don't expect a thing from no one
'Cause they can never get nothin' right
