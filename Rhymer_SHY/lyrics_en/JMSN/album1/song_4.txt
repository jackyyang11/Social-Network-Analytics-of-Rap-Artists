I'm addicted to your love, baby
I'm addicted to your love, yeah
I'm addicted to your love and nothing can save me
Addicted to your love, yeah

It's a curse and a blessing
A curse and a blessing
A curse and a blessing, yeah
And why I keep stressing, I don't know, I don't know

Cause I'm addicted to your love
And I just can't get enough
I'm addicted to, addicted to your love
Your love
Your love
It's a curse and a blessing, a curse and a blessing, yeah

Drink so much that I thought I fell in love
But too much is not enough and I'm tired of bein' fucked up
See I'm wasted and drivin' my truck
I don't know so I'm makin' it up
Tryna stop but I keep speedin' up
Is it wrong if you don't feel it in your gut?
See all I wanna feel is the rush
All I wanna fill is my cup
1, 2 hits then I duck
Just want a little taste of your love
Just want a little taste of your love
It all just seems too much

I'm addicted to, addicted to your love
Your love
Your love
