[Intro:]
I think I'm addicted
I think I'm addicted

[Verse 1:]
It's all on my mind, all of the time
It's all on my mind, I think I'm addicted
It's a quarter to five, still on my grind
It's all on my mind, I think I'm addicted
And I just don't know

[Pre-Hook:]
I think I'm addicted, and I just don't know
It's all on my mind, I think I'm addicted

[Hook:]
So you, I think I'm addicted to
Addicted to loving you, loving you
So you, I think I'm addicted to
Addicted to loving you, loving you

[Verse 2:]
I said it's almost that time, tell me is it a crime
I think I'm addicted
It's a quarter to nine, still on my grind
It's all on my mind, cause I'm so addicted
And I just don't know how

[Pre-Hook:]

[Hook:]

[Outro:]
And I just don't know, think I'm addicted
Cause you know, I'm so addicted
And I just don't know how, (addicted to loving you)
Don't you know that I'm addicted
It's a quarter to five, still on my grind
Think I'm addicted, addicted to your love (your love)
