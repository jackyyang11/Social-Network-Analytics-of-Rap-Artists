[Verse 1]
Most the time I think about
How it's going to end
Then I start to realize
That's just putting energy
Toward the things I don't want to happen
A lot of times I worry about
Runnin' out of ends
Then I start to compromise
And figure out my exit plan
'Cause most the time it's easier to run away
Than try to understand
Where this fear comes from
And why I can't be a stronger man
'Cause everybody knows
You could never trust a person
That can't trust themselves
So I just keep my head down workin'
And I don't take nobody's help
No one loves me, that's alright
I'm just lost inside this maze called life
So if you wanna judge me, go ahead
I got a big ol' plan up in my little head

[Chorus]
And I got an angel
That's down to ride for me
Yeah, she believes in me
Ain't that how it's supposed to be?
Said I got an angel
She'd be down to die for me
She might be my bride to be
See I think about her constantly

[Verse 2]
Can't be calculated
Most the time I'm jaded
But experience it happens
So can't help but be candid
Lord knows this ain't the way I planned it
But we all know shit happens
It might not be what I'm about
But I can't know all the ins and outs

[Chorus]
So I got an angel
That's down to ride for me
Yeah, she believes in me
Ain't that how it's supposed to be?
Said I got an angel
She'd be down to die for me
She might be my bride to be
See I think about her constantly

[Outro]
Said I don't know what happens next
But I know one thing's for certain
That if this blows, last time I checked
No you can't blame shit for workin'
See cash might flow
That big ol' check
But what's behind that big red curtain?
See no one knows
So give respect
'Cause this life's just one big circus
