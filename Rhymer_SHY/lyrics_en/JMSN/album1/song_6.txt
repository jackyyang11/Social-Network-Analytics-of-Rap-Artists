[Verse 1: JMSN]
Staring out the window, waiting for life to stop
Cus everything I been through, never seems to let up
Someone ask me why I feel like I feel, take pill after pill
I wish I could chill politic, and play the game
I dont know the fake from the real, the weight of the steel
From the things that I kill
When I sign my life away

[Hook: JMSN]
Oh you know I want this
I know you need it too
Lets be alone, ah yeah
Lets be alone, ah yeah
Oh you know I want this
I know you need it too
Lets be alone, ah yeah
Lets be alone, ah yeah

Lets be alone, ah yeah
Lets be alone, ah yeah

[Verse 3: JMSN]
I'mma keep it simple, forget the act
I just gotta have ya'
And I'll never stop

[Hook]

[Bridge: JMSN]
I'mma give you what I want, the only thing I need
You call me in my dreams, even when I'm not asleep
Even when I'm not asleep
Your the only thing I got, its clear for me to see
No matter the degree, this is where I wanna be
This is where I wanna be
This is where I wanna be

[Hook]
