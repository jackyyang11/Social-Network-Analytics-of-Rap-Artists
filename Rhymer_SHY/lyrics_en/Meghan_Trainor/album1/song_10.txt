Number thirteen on my album is called "Mr. Almost." This is a hot track, 'cause I had my buddy Shy Carter come in. He's an incredible songwriter and rapper, and he came in and spit a verse for me. And I sent it to him and in an hour he sent it and recorded it right away. This is, uh, it had a lot to do with my past relationships, my "Mr. Almost." They're almost perfect, and then it didn't happen, and, uh, a lot of people can relate to that.
