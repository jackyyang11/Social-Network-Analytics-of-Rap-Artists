The seventh song on my album is called "Bang Dem Sticks!" [Laughs] I wrote this song by myself in my little Nashville apartment and recorded the vocals there. Um, my friend [?] produces in New York and sent me a beat. I fell in love with it. Um, and it was my favorite song, one of my favorite songs, because it showed my rapping, my rap flow! And, uh, how I love drummers! That's the whole concept of the song, and I can't wait to see it live, and to perform it live.
