The third song on my album is called "Dear Future Husband." Um, it's just a few things he needs to know if he wants to be my one and only all my life. [Laughs] Um, this is a great example of my love for old-school doo-wop songs. Kevin [Kadish] and I wrote it together, the guy who did "All About That Bass." And it's a cute little list for my future hubby, he's out there somewhere. It's a cute list for him to get ready, so that when we get married he's fully prepared.
