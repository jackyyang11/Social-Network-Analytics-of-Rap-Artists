The second song on my album is the song "All About That Bass!" 'Cause I wanted to give it to you right away. Um, it was the most successful song I've ever had, obviously, clearly. Um, people seemed to click with it so I wanted to give that to you guys right away when you play my album. "All About That Bass" is about loving yourself, loving your body, loving your insecurities, and having fun with it.
