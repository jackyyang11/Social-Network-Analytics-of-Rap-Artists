Number six on my album is called "Like I'm Gonna Lose You," and it's my song featuring John Legend, the legend himself. I'm such a fan, I'm so glad he wanted to be a part of this song. I wrote it in Nashville with my buddies Justin [Weaver] and Caitlyn [Smith.] Um, it's a very meaningful song to me. It's about when you have those nightmares where your loved one passes away and you wake up sweating and crying, and you go check on them and they're still there and you realize that you're not promised tomorrow, so you're gonna love them like you're losing them.
