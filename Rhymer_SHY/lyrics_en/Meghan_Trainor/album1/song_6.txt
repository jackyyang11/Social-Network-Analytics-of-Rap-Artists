The last song on this album is called "Credit," and this is a lot of people's favorite. Um, this song is hilarious. I wrote it with Kevin [Kadish,] he's very clever with lyrics. Uh, we wrote it about how you see an ex, and they're looking real good, and you're thinking, "oh, I bought you that jacket, so I deserve the credit. If only your new girlfriend knew how much I improved you. [Laughs] How much, I gave you that jacket, I told you to cut your hair like that." And so I'm over here saying, "give that credit where it's due. I made you this cool." But it's just another sassy little girl-power song I put on there, and I thought it was a great way to end the album.
