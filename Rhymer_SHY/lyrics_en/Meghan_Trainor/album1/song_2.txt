The fifth song on my album is called "3am." This song is a song I wrote a while ago as a little songwriter. Um, it never got cut, so I decided to keep it for myself. It's, uh, it's my song for the college kids out there who are drunk texting at 3am. [Laughs] And for anyone else who drunk texts at 3am. It's my song to let you know you're not alone --- I've done it, too, myself. It's alright!
