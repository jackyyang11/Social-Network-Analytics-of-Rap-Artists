Number eleven is "Lips Are Movin'." It's my second single, um, it seems to be doing well on the charts, I'm very happy about it. It's about a co-worker I had who I caught lying to me a bunch, and, um, I compared it to a boy lying to a girl in a relationship, so that everyone would understand what I was talking about. [Laughs] And, um, it's very sassy, it's very aggressive, and, uh, they seem to love singing it when I'm on stage.
