The fourth song on my album is called "Close Your Eyes." It's one of my favorite to perform, because right before I sing it I ask the crowd who out there is beautiful, and they all seem to raise their hand, which I love, that's a good sign. Um, it's just like "All About That Bass" --- it's about loving yourself for who you are, not changing yourself for anybody, but on a more serious level. And, uh, it's one of my favorite that I've written on this album.
