[Hook: Los]
2 verse 1, 2 verse 1
She give me that overtime then that new work come
What you want the red bottoms and that new purse hun?
We can do that, but first I need that 2 verse 1
Drop it low
Drop it, drop it, drop it low
(Dip it)
Break it, break it down
[?] ..my flow
What you want them Gucci boots and that new purse hun?
We can do that, but first I need that 2 verse 1

[Verse 1: Los]
Yo, I'm icy, with a nice V out in SoHo
Your wifey said she like me in a photo
Your wifey and I might creep on the low, though
Cuz ain't nothing wrong with some Ice T and CoCo
I'm Ocho, I don't need no strikes for the hoe though
2 verse 1 for the night and I'm dolo
Laid up with her all night? That's a no no
Seen her back yard took [?] to the go-go
White tee, Polo
Quite G, low pro
We can just do it no Nike logo
Spike Lee and at the game 'Mello dropped 40
Money real loud I don't yell a lot shorty
Louboutin slippers Cinderella copped for me
If you got a hot friend you should tell her Hi for me
She say she got a man? Goddamn, how corny
If you treat the wood right a good.. [?]

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Los]
Uh, I got a Porsche Panamera
And a drop top Super Sport
Balling out like I wore my high tops to the court
Such a cool style, I could crush a crew down
And got [?] like BOW! Motherfucker POOM, POW!
Hunt for the pussy, I'ma gut the womb down
He don't fuck you like me you should cut the fool now
I'm stuntin' too loud, I don't hear those weirdos
My niggas move birds like scarecrows, here goes
The S-W-A-GG-AB-OY, know why? I'm Gucci crazy
I've been running through the paper like its loose leaf lately
Had a bitter past all I need is two sweet ladies
Bigger house, bigger living room
And I ain't talkin bout the living room
Play soccer, nigga, all I do is kick it to em
If they want game, damn right I'ma give it to em
