And I flow on and flow on
[Name your favorite new MCs]
I couldn't hear that word
Because your flow was so loud
I wasn't near that word
I think you said it too low
I think I scared that word
I think I put it on a [?] and smeared that word
[Name your favorite MCs]
Name your favorite MCs?
I couldn't hear
It's just the energy
That you was doing when i was saying it at the same time
Me and you incorporated that rhyme within the same line
I dont really get it
I got two brains in the same mind
I break it down and get two different thoughts at the same time
Had to decypher which one that im gonna do
And when I let it
It's like when a chick end up pregnant
It's the one sperm that made it through the cell
[Ok, lets talk about Drake]
You said Drake
Im talking about these MCs
Rest of these niggas fake
You got Kendrick, Wale
Everybody in the game

That goes by the name Jermaine and not Dupri

Because I had to go back down that road
So you understand
