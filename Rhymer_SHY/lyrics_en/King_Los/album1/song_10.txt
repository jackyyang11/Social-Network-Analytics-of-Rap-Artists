[Hook]
It's all on me (all on me)
Man it's all on me, man it's all on me
Man it's all on me, man it's all one me
And that's what it's gon be
Rich nigga don't sleep
Bitch nigga gon creep
But a nigga gotta eat
Man it's all on me, yeah it's all one me
I guess it's all on me man, it's all on me
(All on me)
If I'm number one I'm gon get this shit on my own
(And that's what it's gon be!
Cause it's all on me man, it's all on me.)
Then they fucked around and got a nigga back in their zone
(I ain't worried 'bout you, why you worrying 'bout me nigga?)
Man it's all on me, man it's all on me
Man it's all on me, man it's all one me
Rich nigga don't sleep
Bitch nigga gon creep
But a nigga gotta eat
So it's all on me
Yeah it's all on me, man it's all on me
Man it's all on me!
Rich nigga don't sleep

[Verse 1]
U ain't know nothing nigga
It was touching blocks and got chill
Feds are calling my niggas
I still made it off the block and got rich
You ain't know nothing nigga
Had it harder in the slums
Lost my cousin to the streets
Lost my father to a gun
You know we famous for the blow
Everytime we roll, dropping hella bands, 50K or more
Know I got brothers in the game 1 locked up and just came home
Do anything for my niggas
So fuck you lames I'm back in my zone
I'm back in my zone, I'm reloaded bang
Fort like Norte Dame, buddish rollie
My little nigga told me put you out
All he want is a frozen chain, And this shit go bang
I don't really know what's in his brain
But I tell you niggas simple and plain
It fall on me, My nigga said he need bail
Fuck it! Charge it to the game

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
U ain’t know nothing nigga
Lost a homie to the feds
Lost a record deal still said imma get this bread
Man U ain’t know nothing nigga
Said imma hustel hard, they can take away the fame imma trust in God
You know i’m famous for the flow
Everywhere I go, pumpin' hella fast 50K or more
You know it’s suckers in the game, they do lame shit like faking they wrong
Told my city imma get it, i’m just mad it took me this long
It took me too long, how [?] running with the feds
Hella shit was running through my head, niggas ending up dead
Hate to see marty like that, they took his girl and they hit him for the bread
Nigga we was bread, right in the [?] shit
Where love don’t really mean love
Where smile don’t mean a nigga really happy for you
So since the day I found out what it was
It’s all on me!
