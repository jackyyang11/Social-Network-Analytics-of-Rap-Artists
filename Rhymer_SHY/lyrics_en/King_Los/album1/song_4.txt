[KING LOS]
Uhh
I wish you all good fortune as well as foresight
This Rollie on my forearm forcing my Porsche lights
Then reflect, reflecting back to that porch light
When it was on, we was on the steps we was taught like
It's so symbolic to follow steps to be taught right
I leave the court like Jordan
See the court like Kid
I seen kids leave the court like, life
I can see the pain of your father's past
I can see the pain that your father passed
I can see your pain 'cuz my father passed
The same pain I had to see further past
Your father had a chance to take you further but your father passed
It's a present in your past
That's present from the presence of your past
It presents itself here in the present
Just don't look past it you got to catch it
Speaking of catching the essence of being caught
Perfectly captures the lessons that being taught
Be it in thought or in deed, Indeed it weighs on us
I’m praying for us, I know they preying on us
Keep no pride in your heart
Let hope rise cause pride pried us apart
Logic and thought consistency with obedience
Time and humble and selfless acts lead the leadership
Lead the ship, be a captain or capsize
Suckers hate cause I up the case like the caps lock
No back space, I'm from the back block
It’s like I hit the space bar on that black drop, ughh
The whack watch but the wise learn
And jealousy will make your best friends' eyes burn
Why turn? Nigga it was our turn
Now a nigga gotta catch the fade like some side burns
The love of money will get niggas on your side burnt
That’s why its wise to sever ties before the tides turn
Apply my ethics, my efforts unmatched
I open doors from my city and left 'em unlatched
Run that, they rob niggas bare face until they face a bear and feel bare look in their face, Uhh
The rare tapes of the incredible
These miracles you can't pencil in on a schedule
Conceptual, exceptional, exception to the rule yes the truly intellectual
Cool introspective of a dude in a confessional
Move, peep the moves of the grooviest professional
I’m blessing you
Seek freedom break free from whatever stressing you
Try to gather the rest without letting em have the best in you
I wish the best for you but it’s probably the worst for you
Shit might not even work for you
Is it worth it to
Be giving my gift if its like a curse to you
Try to write this in cursive too without picking a pen up
Then sign it sincerely yours
The man that has many flaws but master picking his chin up, King
