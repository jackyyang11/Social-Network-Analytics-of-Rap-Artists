[Adam Levine]
"Im at a payphone trying to call home all of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone, baby its all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?

[Verse 1:Adam Levine]
"Yeah I,I know its hard to remember the people we used to be, its even harder to picture, that your not here next to me, you say its too late to make it, but is it too late to try, and in that time that you wasted all of our bridges burnt down"

[BRIDGE]
"I`ve wasted my nights, you turned out the lights, now im paralyzed still stuck in that time, when we called it love, but even the sun sets in paradise"...

[HOOK]
"Im at a payphone trying to call home all of my change I spent on you, where have the times gone baby its all wrong where are the plans we made for two? If happy ever after did exist, I would still be holding you like this, all those fairytales are full of it, One more fucking love song I`ll be sick, ohhh..."
[Verse 2:Adam Levine]
"You turned your back on tomarrow, cause you forgot yesterday, I gave you my love to borrow, but you just gave it away... You can't expect me to be fine, I dont expect you to care, I know I said it before but all of our bridges burnt down...

[BRIDGE]
"I`ve wasted my nights you turned out the lights, now im paralyzed still stuck in that time, when we called it love, but even the sun sets in paradise"...

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]

"Man fuck that shit I`LL be out spending all this money while you sit around wondering why It wasn`t you who came up from nothing, made it from the bottom now when you see me I`m stuntin' and all of my cars start with the push of a botton telling me the chances I blew up or whatever you call it, switch the number to my phone so you never could call it dont need my name on my shirt you can tell that im ballin', swish what a shame couldv`e got picked had a really good game but you missed your last shot so you talk about who you see at the top or what you could`ve saw but sad to say It`s over for, phantom pulled up valet open doors Wiz like go away got what you was looking for now It`s me who they want so you can go and take that little piece of shit with you"
