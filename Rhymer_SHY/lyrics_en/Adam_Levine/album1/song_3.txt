[Verse 1]
So here we are
We've got another chance for life
It's what you want
I can see it in your eyes
You see so clear
It's coming into light
Go on, be wrong
'Cause tomorrow you'll be right
Don't sit around and talk it over
You're running out of time
Just face ahead
No going back now

[Verse 2]
You've come so far
Now see, you're cutting all the ties
You're right, go on
Keep running for your life
Made up your mind
No going back now
See it all come falling down
You've tried so hard to figure out
Just what it's all about
You're fighting on and on and on
For what you know is true
And now say go on and on and on
Do all that you can do

[Chorus]
Hey
We're never gonna go if we don't go now
You're never gonna know if you don't find out
You're never going back, never turning around
You're never gonna go if don't go now
You're never gonna grow if you don't grow now
You're never gonna know if you don't find out
You're never going back, never turning around
You're never gonna go if you don't go now

[Bridge]
Oooh
Yeah
Oooh

[Outro]
You're never gonna go if you don't go now
You're never gonna know if you don't find out
You're never turning back, never turning around
You're never gonna go if you don't go
