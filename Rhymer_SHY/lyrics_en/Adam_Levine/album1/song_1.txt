[Intro - Adam Levine]
Oh, oh yeah
Oh, oh yeah
Oh, oh yeah
Oh, oh yeah

[Verse 1]
I don't know why I don't see happiness in this town (town)
Everyone I meet seems so uptight, wearing their frown (frown)
What good's living where dreams come true if nobody smiles? (smiles)
Everyone's chasing the latest star, the latest style

[Chorus]
You take me to another space
And time
You take me to a higher place
So I'm
About to get out of the race
I don't mind
You ought to know that everything's nothing if I don't have you
Oooh oh oh

[Verse 2]
I don't know if I'm the fool who's getting this all wrong (wrong)
That's the dream to sing the perfect girl the perfect song (song)
All I know is I can't keep on wearing this disguise
When you're the only one that sees what's real in my eyes

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You take me to another space
You take me to a higher place
Oh, yeah

[Chorus]

[Outro]
(Space, Place)
So I'm about to get out of the race
I don't mind
You ought to know that everything's nothing If I don't have you
