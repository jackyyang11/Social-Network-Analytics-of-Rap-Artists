[Verse 1]
Please don't see just a boy caught up in dreams and fantasies
Please see me reachin' out for someone I can't see

[Pre-Chorus]
Take my hand, let's see where we wake up tomorrow
Best laid plans sometimes are just a one night stand
I'll be damned, Cupid's demandin' back his arrow
So let's get drunk on our tears and

[Chorus]
God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
Searching for meaning, but are we all lost stars
Trying to light up the dark?

[Verse 2]
Who are we? Just a speck of dust within the galaxy
Woe is me if we're not careful turns into reality
Don't you dare let our best memories bring you sorrow

[Pre-Chorus]
Yesterday I saw a lion kiss a deer
Turn the page maybe we'll find a brand new ending
Where we're dancing in our tears and

[Chorus]
God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
Searching for meaning, but are we all lost stars
Trying to light up the dark?

[Bridge]
I thought I saw you out there crying, ooh
And I thought I heard you call my name, yeah
And I thought I heard you out there crying, oh
Just the same, oh, yeah

[Chorus]
God, give us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and this lamb is on the run
Searching for meaning, but are we all lost stars?
I try to light up your dark

[Bridge]
I thought I saw you out there crying, ooh
And I thought I heard you call my name, yeah
And I thought I heard you out there crying, oh

[Outro]
But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?
But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?
