This heart of mine is so blind
Just can't see tonight, not doin' right
I walk this thin line
Of this double life

So long, I'm feeling jaded
The one true thing I stand to lose
Caress then slip away

Oh, I just can't do it again
No, I just can't do it
You want your cake and eat it too
No, it ain't right, no, it ain't, ain't right

No time and place
So what do I say? I wanna chill for another day
I'm stirred up to my head, wanna go to bed
Pour a little love until it rains

And sleep all day
I know the loving we'll make
Can make me change my mind
Every time

When you give into desire
There's no telling what it brings
One pathway can take you higher
Or it just might bring you down
Just might bring you down

Oh, I just can't do it again
No, I just can't do it
You want your cake and eat it too
No, it ain't right, no, it ain't, ain't right

Oh, I just can't do it again
No, I just can't do it
You want your cake and eat it too
No, it ain't right, no, it ain't, ain't right

When you give in to desire
There's no telling what it brings
One pathway can take you higher
Or it just might bring you down
Yeah, it just might bring you down
