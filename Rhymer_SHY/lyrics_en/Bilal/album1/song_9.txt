[Verse 1]
How long do you crawl through the woods?
Through muck and mire you stood
We're all in pain
Made you strong
Did you ever get tired to wait, yeah
In your shell anticipate
Old soul
Be born again

[Verse 2]
You were born to fly
When you're not so shy
When you're ready, you're ready
Angels smile
Bloom to bloom
Re-creation
Through and through
A color blue
The morning dew
A summer kiss

[Chorus 1]
Butterfly
The struggle makes you beautiful
The struggle makes you fly
Spread your wings and be new again

[Chorus 2]
Butterfly
The struggle makes you beautiful
The struggle makes you fly
Spread your wings and renew again
