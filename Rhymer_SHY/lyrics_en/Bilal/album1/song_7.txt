Tonight after work let Shane scoop you up
Around eight, nine at the latest we'll be
Sitting low inside (?), riding slow on I street
About to (___) a friend

Look at this Jeep up in front of us
Filled with all those candid eyes yes following us
Tell them to slow it down, talkin 'bout
Where ya headed baby and, can us two follow your lead?
To the spot where your party is at, where its at?

(Chorus)
Rocks, spades (no bluffing)
No bluff, you've gots to play your game (hey)
(2x)

Tonight lets ask Mary and Wanda
You know they'll make both us howl
Cuz they freaks and they did it before

Just trust me that's if ya doubt me
Ask them both they'll tell ya about me
When I get it, you'll want it once more

(Bridge)
Baby bring (y)a friend, baby bring a friend (bring two bring two)
Bring two that's if you're bawdy
(2x)

(Chorus)
(Spoken)
I'ma just ask you this, you know what I mean? Off the record. What's up with you and your girl? I mean both of ya'll.. (?) put her
On the phone

(Bridge)

(Chorus)
Talk about low low
Talk about lean lean
Talk about the finer things
Talk about you.. (?)

Talk about being a star
But baby that's who you are
(?)you wanna roll with me, hold on
