Feel the chills in the summer time, hopped and gold
Something happens to the weather, when you go
I'm tired of shake, take me to heaven
Love me, hate me, fuck me even better
Don't want to come down, wanna be up forever
But I need another fix and you're gone away

It's where you ought to be
Right here next to me, don't go
Don't go astray
I'll keep you close to me
That's where this ought to be
Your only place

Have you seen her, looking all over town?
Looking on the block, I've been waitin on the spot
Who showed up stoned as hell
Using the past as a scapegoat
Old habits so hard to break
Cause you just can't take the pain

It's where you ought to be
Right here next to me
Don't go, don't go, don't go astray
I'll keep you close to me
That's where this ought to be
Your only, your only place

So much, so much, so much

Right here next to me

Need so much, need so much, need so much
