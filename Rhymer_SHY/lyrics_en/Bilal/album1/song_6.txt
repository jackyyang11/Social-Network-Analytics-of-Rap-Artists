[Verse 1]
Tired of all these wars, dwelling in the past
Searching for the honesty in all that jazz
What are we here for, what are we doing?
Last time I checked, thought it was screwin'
Girl, and when I think of me and you
And all the things that we've been through
We're goin' through and, steppin' back
To view the beach, I'm hoping for a brighter day
Girl

[Pre-Hook]
Jump up in the sky and yeah, somehow we got stuck
How do we get back down to us, oh?

[Hook]
How do we get back to love?
Back to love, back to love
Baby, back to love, back to love
How do we get back to love?

[Verse 2]
Baby, come here, let me kiss your temple
Breathe in your ear and cool you down
and get out your suitcase, let's take a trip
Call at the job and tell them you're sick
Making reservations back to love
Your happiness is what I'm for
How's Amsterdam, down to Spain
Into Morocco, Marrakesh

[Pre-Hook]
Take off the flesh, keep it fresh
Decompress, we've come so far

[Hook]
Wanna get back to love
How do we get back to love?
How do we get back to love?
Baby, back to love
How do we get back to love?
How do we get back to love?

[Bridge]
Like the fruit that falls from the trees
Stronger than the rose that grows from the concrete
We can bask in the light of the sun
And feel the love revolving around us

[Hook]
Baby, back to love
How do we get back to love?
How do we get back to love?
Yeah girl, back to love
How do we get back to love?
How do we get back to love?
