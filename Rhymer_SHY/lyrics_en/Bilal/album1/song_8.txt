[Verse 1]
She turned away, away, away
Yeah, she turned around, she turned around alright
Nothing's for certain again
Yeah I know, just what it is
It’s just like rain, it’s just like
From moment to moment we go
Until it ends
As soon as we get comfortable, it changes overnight
Overnight
Fly away, fly away, fly away
From here, fly away higher

[Chorus]
Bury me next to you
Oh
I want to be next to you

[Verse 2]
Fall away into the void
Faint light you’ve drifted abandonment
Carrying crossroads, can’t speak the language
What started as one of a two sided coin

[Chorus]
Bury me next to you
Oh
I want to be next to you

[Verse 3]
If being we means love and broken hearts collided
Like ashes in the sky your twisted affirmations
Are lost in the melancholy sounds of everlasting harmony
Of hearts
Hearts

[Chorus]
Bury me next to you
Oh
I want to be next to you
