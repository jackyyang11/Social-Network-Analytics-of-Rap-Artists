I played the fool before
Stared at the sun till it burned out my eyesight
Blind, but a man must move on
No time for regrets, who lives to rehearse?
Rehearse the times you were here
Through other ladies, I drove myself crazy
Wondering why they weren't you
You may think I'm a fool, but still-
I did it all for us
You know I did it all for love
When you stayed in the sun too long
Even the sun moves on
All for what?
You know I did it all for love
Maybe it's
I am seeker in search of a dreamer
She dreams! She dreams! She lays her head down and dreams
Or maybe it's me this time
But, baby let's live
Or maybe it's me this time
Yeah, I played a fool before
Blind but a man must move on
No time for regrets, who lives to rehearse?
Rehearse the times you were here
Through other ladies I drove myself crazy
Wondering why they weren't you
May think I'm a fool, but still
I did it all for love, all for love
Stayed in the sun too long
Even the sun moves on
I did it for me and you
Stayed in the sun too long
Even the sun moves on
All for love(X2)
