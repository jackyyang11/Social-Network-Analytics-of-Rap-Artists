Hella fine, hella fine
I feel when them bitches smash mo'
Tell 'em to give me nothing
Tempted to give up
Tell 'em to give me nothing
Tempted to give up
Tell 'em to give me nothing
Tempted to give up
Tell 'em to give me nothing
Tempted to give up
All that I am
All that I thought you wanted me
All that I am
