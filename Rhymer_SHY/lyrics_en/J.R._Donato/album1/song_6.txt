[Intro]
Donato
Yah
Ugh
Ugh

[Verse 1: J.R. Donato]
Calling em slick like lets hit a lick
Drop the controller and bring the sticks
Grab my bandana you get the drift
And when you pull up we gone switch the whip
I'ma call buddy and tell him this
I really got thirty-three to spend
He gone pull up thinking this legit
Then you come out the cut and make that assist
That's how we do them like every rip
Been out here robbing and jacking shit
Rapping done put me on different shit
Cap put me on some more pimpin shit
Might notice I walk with some different shit
Get your little hoe to hop in that whip and shit
I'm in Austin cooling with Olympians
I got Nudie Jeans over Timberlands
And them other niggas I ain't feeling them
And the way I'm working oh so diligent
Tommy boxers on when she lay with him
All these Tommy's on like they paying him
He out of order?, make me shoot the chopper
My team look like Florida with all of this water
Cause I get a lot of, I'm talking them guapas

[Hook: J.R. Donato]
Long as I'm still breathing best believe I'm chiefing strong
Yo bitch love my Tommy boxers, O.G. reefer we be on
Life's so sweet looking down into these double styrofoams
Straight O.G. looking up I'm about to stuff another cone

[Verse 2: J.R. Donato]
Life so sweet
The bitch say my ice on fleek
From the Chi keep Mikes on my feet
Rolling up that's straight O.G
I let my actions speak
Do the most cause I might say the least
Work hard play hard and for keeps
And I can't fuck with no hoe this week
Got a mac make it scream like Meek
When I'm home keep that hoe in my reach
Diamonds sunny like a mother fucking beach
Thought he was slime but that niggas a leach
Can't fuck with them, they don't nothing about risks
Act like they do not exist
I don't drink liquor I sip
I don't chase hoes I pimp
I got a couple of tips
I got a couple of whips
I ain't been home in a minute
I ain't been fucking with them
Bitches want to fall in love with the kid
Bitches thinking they really cuffing the kid
Lifestyle fall in love with this shit
My style she in love with the shit
Pipe down you ain't bustin no shit
Pipe down you ain't nothin lil' bitch

[Hook: J.R. Donato]
Long as I'm still breathing best believe I'm chiefing strong
Yo bitch love my Tommy boxers, O.G. reefer we be on
Life's so sweet looking down into these double styrofoams
Straight O.G. looking up I'm about to stuff another cone
