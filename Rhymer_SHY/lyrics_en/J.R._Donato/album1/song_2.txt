[Intro:]
Hey
Fast Money, Freedom
Yeah, Gang
Look

[Verse 1:]
Smoke 'till you doze off
Then I'm taking your clothes off
They right there go with no bra
Damn, you got me like so hot
Work the block, I go so hard
Serve his ass, then I skirt off
She didn't called me, now she wanna get pick'd up
Puttin' on 'till we goin off
Hey, and we goin' off
Top floor, with your hoe and all
I got guap so I'm showin' off
He wouldn't know cause he ain't involved
Dont know that number, you can hold that call
I didn't think that we would go this far
I don't want you to go at all
Stay here with me, stay lit with me
Sip Texas tea
You bought the shroomz, quit pressure me
We get no sleep
I know you up, just keep me up
And girl we goon' see
Dont want you to go
You dont wanna go
Just take off your clothes
Hey, look

[Hook:]
I don't want you to go nowhere
I don't want you to go nowhere
Be right here, lean right here
All the shots that I wanna share
I don’t want you to go nowhere
I don’t want you to go nowhere
Bae and friend they can come over here
But make sure they really don’t know where it is
I don’t want you to go nowhere
Make sure you don’t wanna go nowhere
A lot of weed
I got a lot of lean
I got a lot of drugs, that I would love to share
I don’t want you to go nowhere
I don’t want you to go nowhere
Don’t go nowhere
