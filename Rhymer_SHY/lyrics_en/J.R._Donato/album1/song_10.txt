[Intro: J.R. Donato]
Nigga came up thuggin'
Young Donato, ey ey

[Verse 1: J.R. Donato]
Uh, head out the sunroof
Ridin' in the Benzo, ey
Can't rifle like spenzo, ey
Still chokin' on indo, ey
And they see you gettin' fatter nigga, uh
Trippin laughin' at these caterpillars, uh
Ring suck ass decided niggas, uh
Zannies get me off a balance nigga
But shout two 9's, girl what I'm talkin' nigga talkin' two 9's, lean bad for me but I'm doin' just fine
Do it for the crip, baby do it for the squad
Know damn well you'll do it for the vine
Clip 4 gun gotta keep it by my side
One bad trip put it on a nigga mind
Bust it up for us and make sure you do it wide
When she outchea back, don't think she has a spine
She got nothin' to huddle I gotta check on the body
Might have a weapon or something, peep-pop the nigga's a dummy
Give 'em 11 like Thompson, stuff your mouth full a shroomz don't vomit (no)
And we rollin' up Raw's why you niggas take blunts to the face
Fuck that shit cut to the chace, money talks anyway
And you niggas got nothing to say, all they get is couple bucks out the safe
It's a hundred in the round not much in the K
On shroomz and you lookin' like a munchkin to me
Got a whole P of weed and some munchy to eat
I ain't trippin' cause I'm king and I know I gotta get it
That ain't loud fuck you mean boy I know you sellin' midget
Eatin' diced pineapples at the W, oh you got some bad friends bring a couple too
Michenelle and Chanelle how I smother you
J and R my initials so it might cover you
Girl I flip in the pussy I might tell a bitch
Chris Johnson that pussy how I be runnin' through
And even countin' the bands man I'm just thumbin' through 'em
Clip 4 finish you it's a movie, double cup get it stuffed, keep it movin'
We gon' see some white cups and a doobie
Acid rap bitch but I'm on shroomiez

[Hook] (2x)
Table full of shroomiez (table full of shroomiez)
Chokin' of a doobie (something outta nothing)
This a Hollywood movie (this a Hollywood movie)
And you know it's yours truly (something outta nothing)
And you know it's your truly (something outta nothing)
She ain't got no rules (she ain't got no rules)
And she brought them shroomz (and she brought them shroomz)
Fuckin' Hollywood movie (fuckin' Hollywood movie)
And you know it's yours truly

[Outro]
