[1st Verse] J.R. Donato

I been gettin to the money, so Im prolly droppin bands
If you claim you gettin' money then you prolly understand
I ain't gettin in to spend'n it,I'm really tryin to feed my mans
Even gettin dirty money
Hold up, Let me wash my hands
I done parked the BMW
Im tryin' to get the Benz
Might be swervin' differnt avenues they try'n get up in
I ain't trippin' on that bubble gum because girl I gotta win
I got it painted, look like Bubble gum
And girl so do the rims
In the Chi handlin' business
But shawty I don't wear a suit
Prolly spent her for some hours, prolly got an attitude
Shawty you know how I do
My diamonds black and some are blue
Some are pink, some are yellow
Some are red, Yeah, they are cool
Im a dog her me say, "Ruf"
I say poof, there go the roof
HBE label and crew, you can bet they comin' through
I got horseshoes on my pockets
So they chosin', thats the truth
When Im comin' better move, prolly run you over too

[Verse 2] J.R. Donato

I came in wit bands, spent it and did it again
Prolly cool as a fan, AC in the winter, and wind
You ain't grindin', you slippin'
Because shawty I bet we get it in
My assignment is get it, get it, and never turn it in
Yeah the paint like a turtle, the seats all purple-Ninja Turtle
A nerd gave me Urkel, I hit the gas I thought it was Turbo
Now drop it like its hot
This ain't no sun-drop commercial
Im killin' em, But verbal, around these clowns I run in circles

Alright, we goin? She say prolly
I'm prolly wit my posy
I do this for the sport
Yes thats prolly why she really jockin'
I move she prolly watchin'
Im prolly in versace
New paint job teriyaki
Ride me-No kawasaki
Got swag and you got nadda
Bout checks, and bout a dolla
Just chopped it up wit scolla
Thats my polo, check the colla

Im coolin?-Prolly, Prolly
A movie?-Prolly, Prolly
More Gucci?-Prolly, Prolly
More Louie?-Prolly, Prolly
