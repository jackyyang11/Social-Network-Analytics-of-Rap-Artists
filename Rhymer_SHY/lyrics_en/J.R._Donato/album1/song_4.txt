Sledro
Fast money and freedom
Hey!

[Verse 1]
Said I just got home, change clothes
Hit the city, prolly kick it with some bitches, I suppose
Keep some weed of they own
Spendin' G's on they own
So we prolly blow some though
And they wonder do I sleep alone?
I get 'em to the condo, pass 'em like Rondo
Silk sheets, when we sleepin' on
Might fuck her till the morn then I gotta send her home
Fuck it, we still in the city
I can spend a 50
And I got my niggas with me
Bad bitches with me
And they rollin' up the sticky
We ain't bein' picky
Hoe I hope you got on Vickys
Rollin' loud, Oklahoma got some thunder with me
Got them bands up in the bando, and a runner with me
Take your bitches to white bear we don’t fuck with Denny's
Tell me why I get the feelin' that you fuckin' with me
I wouldn't lie
I be so high
OG clouds, hold me down
You can catch me in the sky
Never low
10 bands on my coke
Get your hands off my coat
Man we ain’t let it go
So you know
Put the money in the toke
Take a toke tryin' to smoke
Baby call, I’m tryin' to fuck you on the boat
Hammers everywher I go
Cause I cannot trust a soul
Ask a nigga is ya slime or ya fo
Out the bando
Fresh off the road hit the city I suppose
Kick it with some bitches I suppose
Headed out this bitch so the wanna blow some dro
Sledro my bro
He (?)
