[Verse 1:]
Light the weed, hell is you doin?
Soak a towel in this bitch
Hella models, it’s Donato, flower power in this bitch
Crackin seals, ain’t no liquor so the bottles in this bitch
How you feel?
Do you have some pride to swallow in this bitch
Grab my styrofoam and sip
Grab my phone i got some hits
Boy that tour was hella legit
Funny how them hoes just fell on my dick
Ain't selling my soul, I’m tryna get rich
Ain’t selling no poles, he doing them hits
Pouring up fours, I need my fix
Dodging these hoes, can’t fuck with a bitch
Aye, ask em what up?
Aye, fresh off the bus, gun on the tuck, ounce on the tuck
Smelling like skunk, they know whats up, aye
Don’t know who to trust
Can’t put no trust in the Gov, put trust in my gun
We clapping shit up, we do this for fun
You know where I’m from, nigga

[Chorus:]
Too perfect, can’t trust it
I splurge no budget
That pole on me, I’m up there
That lean I double cup it
My bitch she steady fussing
Boy, we run this shit, we front this shit
Can’t touch, can’t touch this
Can’t touch, can’t touch this
Can’t touch this, can’t touch this
Can’t touch this, can’t touch this
Can’t touch, can’t touch this
Can’t touch, can’t touch this
Can’t touch this, can’t touch this
Can’t touch this, can’t touch this

[Verse 2:]
More syrup bottles in this bitch
Stunt like the lotto just been hit
I seen a lot of different shit
That’s why I keep this pimpin’ shit
Need some pounds and need some bricks
You ain’t from here, won’t get that shit
Ain’t got no game, won't pull that bitch
Skrr, skrr, skrrr, all you hear is my whip
Stunt on these niggas, I came from nothing
Run through a check and these lil’ bitches love it
Pull out with your bitch, I’m smoking an onion
Mix up designers and shit, I’m like fuck it
I could pull up with the trunk and the frontin'
Reverse that bitch at the crib and start dumping’
Grams on my neck, like water, they love it
I’m tryna get with your daughter or somethin’
Hey, roll that shit up, roll that shit up
Then take a puff, aye
I like to stunt, aye
They think at times I do too much, aye
Don’t know who to trust
Can’t put no trust in the gov, put trust in my gun
We clapping shit up, you know where I’m from
We do this for fun, nigga

[Chorus:]
