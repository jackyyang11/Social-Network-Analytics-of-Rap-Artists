[Hook] J.R. Donato
Oh Honey!
All my goons on alert
Oh Honey, me ain't gotta flirt
She turned up, I finna take it down
Don't think they listenin'
I might just have to break it down

Ugh! All this money on me
Ugh! All this money on me
Ugh! Paint wet, then it might drip
20 k just to shine when the light hit

[1st Verse] J.R. Donato
Call me conce
They Call me J.R
I hit the V.I.P. its poppin like an A-R
So over the country, they know me out in AR
We gotta play smart, Trust never goes far
I ain't goin lie, I keep a plug with my Mexicans
My cousin, Melvin got me coolin' out in Madison
She blowin' me up in my interview, I can't have that again
Dirt on my name, I brush it off and then I flex again
Youngin who fresh as dis?
Diamonds in my necklaces
Im too consistant, yeah I did it and I did it big
Your girl just hit me, said she heard me on the radio
?
Hard goons in low-tops
When will the show stop?
Prolly when the clock stops
Chuck taylor high-tops (swag)
Im in the sky box
Why would you try I
Big money layin' round
Divide it, break it down

[Hook]

[2nd Verse] J.R. Donato
The bag right here, The cash right here
I break em down, down. I think Im Frank Neer
All black shades, Tent me up at every show
I can't even vision you, hatin' Individuals
Not in my division
But you want to be identical
I know what I finna do
Just flexin' till I finish you
Can't stand it you move in
Then sick of you, lyrical, pinacle
Florida wit my seminoles
Gators put a grip on you
Big Bank, Ugh!
What we gotta chase? Ugh!
I'mma go and get it
Whats the reason for the wait?
Hammer on Big-T, be the reason for the wake
Tryna get this money
But she say she wanna date
Prolly see my face, ?
Call it perfect timing
And my diamonds goin' remind her
Top floor at Crowne Plaza
Tom and Jerry, just reclining
Usually of the ground
Let me break it down

[Hook]
