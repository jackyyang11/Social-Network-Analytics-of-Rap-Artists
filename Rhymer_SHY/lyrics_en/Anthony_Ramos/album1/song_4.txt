Chorus:
I can see the light
I can see the light
Shining through the night
I can see the light

I can feel the ghost
Of our holy season's host
Loving on me the most
I can feel the ghost

Hook:
'Cause when the day breaks dawn
Comes in the afternoon
Through the sky painted with pillows of white
A chill fills your soul with the desire to spend the night
With loved ones by the fire

Chorus:
And I can see the light
I can see the light
Season's spirit taking flight
In the city shining bright
To illuminate the night

Verse:
Break your heart for the people
Spread a little love for those who need it
Who need it
The closest thing to a steeple
Is the love we're gifted to give

Hook:
'Cause there's a higher purpose for us to celebrate
The baby who came to destroy hate
And give us love, peace, and grace
For the darkest days
There's a higher purpose for us to celebrate

Chorus:
And I can see the light
I can see the light
Season's spirit taking flight
In the city shining bright
To illuminate the night

Bridge
'Cause it shouldn't be just for a season
But through the year is the reason
We give to one another
The one flows from the cover
And just for a moment
Everything stops
In time

Chorus
I can feel the light
I can feel the light
Time is spreading through the night
Open up our hearts and minds
Hope is on its way tonight

I can feel the light
I can feel the light
Time is spreading through the night
Open up our hearts and minds
Hope is on its way

I can feel the light
I can feel the light
I can feel the light
Time is spreading through the night
Open up our hearts and minds
Hope is on its way tonight

'Cause I can feel the light
