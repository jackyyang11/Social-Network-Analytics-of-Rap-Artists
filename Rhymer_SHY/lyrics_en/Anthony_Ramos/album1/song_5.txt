Oooh
Oooh
Oooh
Oooh

Tell me, does your love change
Dependin' on who calls you?
Tell me, are we all the same?
Or is there one true?

Are you listening?
Are you there?
We keep falling
Do you care?
Is it all a part of the plan?

Or is it us?
Did we lose it?
Did we ruin all the beauty?
Is it too late to recover
From the bruises?
