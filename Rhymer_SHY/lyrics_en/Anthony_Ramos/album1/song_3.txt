[Verse 1]
I was told that a life has no price, you see
But the hate in your eyes put a price on me
If the natives were slain for your liberty
Please explain what you mean by "The Land of the Free"

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh say can you see
But can you really see?

[Chorus]
What does freedom really mean?
'Cause what I've been sold, ain't what I believe
Maybe freedom ain't for me
'Cause what I've been shown, ain't what I can see

[Verse 2]
Uh
Been darker days since election day (election day)
The rose colors seem to fade away (fade away)
The white sheet's coming out to play
This is backwards oh
'63 I thought the chains were broken and released
But what about all my brothers in penitentiaries
We'll be floatin' in oceans before we notice
We're headed for disaster

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh say can you see
But can you really see?

[Chorus]
What does freedom really mean?
'Cause what I've been sold, ain't what I believe
Maybe freedom ain't for me
'Cause what I've been shown, ain't what I can see

[Bridge]
We’ve got
One nation
Under God
Indivisible
It will be washed away
If we're complacent (if we're complacent)
And divided (And divided)
If we're invisible
We have to ask ourselves

[Chorus]
What does freedom mean to me?
Is what I've been sold what I believe?
Maybe freedom ain't for me
'Cause what I've been shown, ain't what I can see
(Our brothers are bleeding, sisters are weepin' oh)
Maybe freedom ain't for me (Don't you want better)
'Cause what I've been shown (I know we want better)
Ain't what I can see (whoa)
It ain't what I can see (whoa)
It ain't what I can see
It ain't what I can see
