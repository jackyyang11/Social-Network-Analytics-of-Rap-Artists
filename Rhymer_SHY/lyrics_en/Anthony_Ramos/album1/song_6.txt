[Verse 1]
I wrote a letter to my granddaughter
I said I'm sorry I don't get to meet ya
I wrote a letter to my grandmother
Said I really can't wait to see ya

[Refrain 1]
In Heaven
I heard there's a river of gold that flows through a crowd of angels
To a city that knows no pain, no fear, or anger
And I'm sittin' here in my tears prayin'
Oooh

[Chorus]
Father, won't you please forgive this soldier
He claims that what he's doing is for you
Father, I can feel you getting closer
And I'm not ready
But we don't choose

When the bell tolls

When the bell tolls

[Verse 2]
I thought I'd only ever see it on the TV
I never thought it would be me
Now I'm layin' here begging you for mercy
Wondering if you'll leave or see me through these
Blood stains
Take me with my mistakes
You're who's left with this pain

[Refrain 2]
From Heaven
With a ray from a river of gold that flows through a crowd of angels
To a city that knows no pain, no fear, or anger
Now I'm lyin' here in my tears prayin'
Oooh

[Chorus]
Father, won't you please forgive this soldier
He claims that what he's doing is for you
Father, I can feel you getting closer
And I'm not ready
But we don't choose

When the bell tolls

When the bell tolls

When the bell tolls

When the bell tolls

When the bell tolls

When the bell tolls
