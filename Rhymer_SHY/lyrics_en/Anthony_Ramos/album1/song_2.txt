[Intro]
Make my way back to common ground
Make my way back to common ground
Make my way back to common ground
Make my way back

[Verse 1]
Am I angry?
Tell me am I angry?
At the picture in my head
Of what's ahead
I'm trying to have patience
But my heart keeps on breakin'
Cause I trust you to protect
But you turn your back instead

[Refrain]
Too many times I let you get away with murder
How am I to explain this insanity to our future

[Chorus]
You can call it what you want
But I'm watching what you do
And I'm calling you out
And I'm calling you out
If we pretend like we don’t know
We won’t mend and we won’t grow
So I'm calling you out
And I'm reaching out
To make our way back to common ground
Let’s make our way back to common ground
Make our way back to common ground
Make our way back

[Verse 2]
You had me thinking it was perfect
Nothing wrong
But now I see I was deceived
The cracks have shown
Couldn't believe it I perceived it was built on truth
Uncovered the facts damn
Let's see what else you got hidin'
Black and white, black and white, black and white
You cut out the colors to paint a line
The red on your hands is hard to hide
All of a sudden you’re colorblind
Black and white, black and white, black and white
Despite all the pictures of painted lies
I have a dream that we make it right
I have a dream that we make it right
I have a dream

[Chorus]
So call it what you want
But I'm watching what you do
And I'm calling you out
I'm calling you out
Don't pretend like we don’t know
We won’t mend and we won’t grow
So I'm calling you out
And I'm reaching out
To make our way back to common ground
Let’s make our way back to common ground

[Verse 3]
I can’t move forward without you
I ain't about to leave our legacy to wither away
There’s too much at stake
I know we can make our way

[Refrain]
Too many times I let you get away with murder
I refuse to explain this insanity to our future

[Chorus]
You can call it what you want
But I'm watching what you do
And I'm calling you out
And I'm calling you out
If we pretend like we don’t know
We won’t mend and we won’t grow
So I'm calling you out
And I'm reaching out
To make our way back to common ground
Let’s make our way back to common ground
