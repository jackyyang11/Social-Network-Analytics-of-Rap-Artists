[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Fuck the industry, won’t let ‘em take me under
Take care of my family, all I ever wanted
Stack up my money, all I ever wanted
I don’t fit in with these niggas, I won’t change for nothing
Fuck up a pack, I know about it
Shoot out with that strap, I can tell you ‘bout it
Run up a check and I get around it
On that adding up that money and I’m steady countin’

[Verse 1: OG 3Three]
I go by 3Three, I’m the sickest OG doin’ something
Run the crazy sack, shit that’s all I wanted
Never leave my brother, shit we stand for something
Got to get this money, keep that on a hundred
Niggas is your niggas ‘til they turn to bitches
Watching in disguise, they just want the riches
We gotta stand for something even in our city
YB finally made it, he finna touch a ticket
Gang gang gang shit, that’s all we know
All we want is money man, fuck these hoes
Running up that sack, shit that’s how that goes
Lil nigga you can go, you better play your role

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Fuck the industry, won’t let ‘em take me under
Take care of my family, all I ever wanted
Stack up my money, all I ever wanted
I don’t fit in with these niggas, I won’t change for nothing
Fuck up a pack, I know about it
Shoot out with that strap, I can tell you ‘bout it
Run up a check and I get around it
On that adding up that money and I’m steady countin’

[Verse 2: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I grew up Baton Rouge wit' no father figure
I been in the streets ever since that I was little
Ever since that I was young I wanted to be that nigga
I watched my daddy beat my mama, I couldn’t even help
But you know I had to grow up shit, and now I’m older
Nigga better not play like that, I put that on Dave, I’ma fold him
Jumped off the porch, I got in beef for gun I was totin’
Ain’t had nobody for to save me, my own I could hold it
Nigga think he gon’ bring me, boy I doubt it
I’ma up get to shootin’, ain’t no ho inside me
Everything that I say, yeah I’m sure about it
Nigga diss, I won’t speak, I’ma see about it
Running, ducking from bullets, I know about it
Niggas rapping ‘bout shit and ain’t riding ‘bout it
We up in the streets, we ain’t hiding ‘bout it
Yeah we up in the streets, we ain’t hiding ‘bout it

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Fuck the industry, won’t let ‘em take me under
Take care of my family, all I ever wanted
Stack up my money, all I ever wanted
I don’t fit in with these niggas, I won’t change for nothing
Fuck up a pack, I know about it
Shoot out with that strap, I can tell you ‘bout it
Run up a check and I get around it
On that adding up that money and I’m steady countin’
