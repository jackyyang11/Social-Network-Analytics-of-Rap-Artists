Another nigga body bagged
Ain't dat shit sad?
Wit my slab all designer give no fucks it's mismatched
Wit two flips, call up lil jit

Boss move big finesse moves
Did dat no stick
Another nigga body bagged
Ain't dat shit sad?
Wit my slab all designer give no fucks it's mismatched
Wit two flips, call up lil jit
Have his shit gripped

[Verse]
Movin like the president
Thought dat was evident
I'm feelin type heaven sent, nah I'm just arrogant
Flooded pussy bitch be wet
Done dived in wit no vest
I'm gone flex Pablo talk dat check
Medellin elect
Ice tray da game gulf of Mexico call up da plug
Steppin in deez Valentinos 3flip fuck it, fuck em up
You can't live like us
Better tighten up
Pull up military rover truck pullin Chernobyl stunts
Swangin fist
I ain't gon miss don't get to close to me
Gucci rag round my neck, dat be my rosary
Swangin fist
I ain't gon miss don't get to close to me
Gucci rag round my neck, dat be my rosary
