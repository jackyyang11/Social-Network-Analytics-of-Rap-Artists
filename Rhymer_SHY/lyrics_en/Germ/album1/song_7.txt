I pull up flexing everybody wanna be me this shit easy

[Verse]
Boy this shits easy
Ran off with a check
Niggas mad I got their bitches in my Pokedex
I feel just like Ash Ketchum, I caught me all, I did it right riding around the city
Couple bitches with me tweaking off that bobby, Whitney
Bitch I look like Diddy (diddy)
Bad boy, bag boy
Bitch I'm getting cash boy
Gucci down my bitch, she from Italy she into me
My money a priority, so hit that bitch will be blowing me
Rolling, bitch I'm smoking heard you want bluff
That's unfortunate I just watered my watch and got a Glock
I mean business, real shit
No time for none of that fake shit, real shit (lil bitch)

Who the fuck is at my window
These niggas watching me why
Cause I'm so icy
I flexed up on these niggas bitches its so easy
I pull up flexing everybody wanna be me this shits easy
