[Verse 1]
Niggas never know whats next
Might fuck around hit prez wit da vette
Manslaughter grand theft auto parts of da problem
Los Santos scholar
Been a piece of shit since da get go hold on
Move slow double cup overflowing
Hoover dam my wrist
Who da fuck finna shine like this
Batter up back to backswing and miss
Pitching sauce swear to god
Couple pills couple blunts I can't feel my face
I feel no laws
Fuck that these niggas mad
I need it all I gotta ball ain't never gon stop
Til that motherfuckin casket drop

[Verse 2]
Born a bad guy
Born to die
Never could abide
Smoking been da only hope
It's back to back, pot cancer smoke
It's sad to say you in my way
Parlay broad day tripping face
Bitches bitchin bout my business like you partake in my pay
It's another holiday I'm shining like I'm st nick
Little finger frosted, shit cost me 'bout 2 licks
Chapo just hit my phone like got a brick
Pulled up, ran off dat choppa, sung a sad song

[Outro: Juicy J]
This dope got my voice sounding like I'm chopped and screwed
Dope, dope got my voice sounding like I'm chopped and screwed
This dope got my voice sounding like I'm chopped and screwed
Dope, dope got my voice sounding like I'm chopped and screwed
This dope got my voice sounding like I'm chopped and screwed
Dope, dope got my voice sounding like I'm chopped and screwed
