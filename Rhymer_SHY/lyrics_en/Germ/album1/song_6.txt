I got work, bitch I got that lean
Bitch I got the xans, bitch I'm on that lean
[?], working with the work
Talking all that crazy shit, your ass gon' get hurt

Bitch I got that lean, bitch I got that work
Bitch I got that xan, bitch I got that lean
Bitch I work, bitch I got that work
Bitch I got that work, I got that work

Bitch I'm with that bullshit
You talking shit, your ass get hit with full clips
Never been a bitch, all my niggas been with that bullshit
Pull up on your block and hit the nigga with the Smith & Wesson
Teach a young nigga lesson, it's nothing, bitch I'm never stressing
Ran up in the house, I'm kicking down doors, you know how it go
I'm doing the four four, whipping at the foe and I hit your grandma in her fucking nose
It's nothing young nigga, it's nothing young nigga
Big guns my nigga, I'm busting my nigga
Bitch I got racks, bitch I got that work
Pull up on your block, I'm off a perc, I'm with the work
Please don't hit my line, don't waste my time, money be on my mind
Please get out my face, the money be on my line

I got work, bitch I got that lean
Bitch I got the xans, bitch I'm on that lean
[?], working with the work
Talking all that crazy shit, your ass gon' get hurt
Bitch I got lean, bitch I got that work
Bitch I got the xans, and I'm on that lean
[?], working with the work
Talking all that crazy shit, your ass gon' get hurt
