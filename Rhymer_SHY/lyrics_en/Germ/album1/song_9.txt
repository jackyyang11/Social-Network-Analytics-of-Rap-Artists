[VERSE I: Germ]
Bitch I been that motherfucker always loaded
Hoping that these faggots fucking die
Middle finger to the sky, DIRTYNASTY$UICIDE
Midget bitch with me holdin' dirty 9
Cross in line little bitch I never gave a fuck
Ask if I did nothin', who lit em' up
Locate yo' bitch little bitch
I fuck around, feed her skeezer musty dick
Chevy ridin', swervin' ,curvin' purpose, I ain't got nowhere to go, bag is full of soul
Frontin these maricóns
Holy matrimony with that bullshit
I'm not your homie cool it with that bro shit
I'm broke and unfortunate, holdin' and hopin' that I could pull up
Fuck The Population, everybody hating up the hammer my nigga give it up

[VERSE II: RUBY DA CHERRY]
Fuck a pig
Fuck a little bitch I beat it raw, bitch I beat em' up
Bitch I be that dirty motherfucker corrupting yo' bitch in the cut
And she say she don't fuck but for me she let me put it in her butt, uh
Fuck a hoe, Ruby already know
Buy her a rose now my dick's in her throat
Pull it back out and say I gotta go
Yung $now stay cold he don't need a fucking coat
Bitch I be that dirty motherfucker 6 days in the back, 6 dames in the back, 6 blades in the pack
I don't give a fuck about thots on me
Six days in the back while I'm still on the track
Expected intestine, the level infected
Rejected my guesses it’s okay
I respect it and I blame that these bitches
Are stupid but fuck all these hoes that start soon and it sucks It's whatever

[VERSE III: YUNG CHRI$T]
Say you runnin' up with your gun
I'm callin' your bluff motherfucker I know you walkin'
Down to pull my gun up before the sun come up
Grim Reaper gonna show up for you soul and some
Body parts, Tony with the Tommy got a loaded drum
Bum bum bum bum, here the chopper come
All hail to the motherfucking fallen one, Yung Christ, lil' bitch
Mosh pit throwing elbows, screaming Fuck Y'all Hoes
Fear nobody bitch I'm live from the gutter
Fuck boys still stutter
Under they covers
They know that I'm comin', run to ya mothers
Scarecrow not frontin', knuckin' and buckin'

See through the blood
Not worried I light up the blunt
