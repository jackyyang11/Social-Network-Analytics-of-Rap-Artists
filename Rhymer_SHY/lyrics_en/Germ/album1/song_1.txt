Damn I love that bag
Damn l love ya bitch
Air max when I step in case I see a lick
I pulled up
Pulled off DUI I'm in that M6
Out that moonroof
2 shooters screaming bad shit
Damn I love that bag
Damn l love ya bitch
Air max when I step in case I see a lick
I pulled up
Pulled off DUI I'm in that M6
Out that moonroof
2 shooters screaming bad shit

[Verse 1]
She look at me it's andele
What else I gotta say
Dabbin in da latest fashion like I walk the runway
Goyard at da skatepark going hard
It's all I got
Let the tec drop and thotties flock
She said she wanna touch my bedrock
But she tripping she on molly rocks
Told me that she loved me bitch you
Stoopid stop all that toddler talk
Finesse yo bitch ent see me left that hoe wit weak knees
Believe me VVS catch light like CDs
Rude boy lil Haiti baby pompano
Atlanta made me dripping water slaughter
Daughters beamer coupe wit seats sat
Back now her head in my lap
Pushing 90 wit da strap
Get yo funds up
Mines taller then a long jump
I'm the wrong one wit da gun
Out the uber, boy run, shits sick new whip
Red paint slit wrists
Drip
