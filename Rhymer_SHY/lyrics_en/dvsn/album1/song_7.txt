[Intro: Sample]
All of your life
Between heaven and hell
A great big fictitious game
(to live, to know)
Where to live is to know
(your shames, your pains)
All your shames and your pains
To be in such a plain old happiness
(You are a special one)
Cause you are a special wonder
And let nobody put you under

[Verse 1]
Go on and tell me that you'll never leave me
Tell me you need me
If you believe me
And you know that I ain't never cheated
And if I did then I didn't mean it
Girl I'm just playing there ain't no reason
To make you feel like you ain't the meaning

[Chorus]
So go let all your friends know
This one think's you're special

[Bridge]
And all nowadays
I, I say this often
Multiple choices
There's always options
They want to be you
You see them loving
Trying to get a detail
All the above and

[Chorus]
Go let all your friends know
This one think's you're special
So go let all your friends know
We got something, something, something

[Verse 2]
If they come looking for me lie lie lie baby, lie baby
And if they take me out tonight night baby
Don't cry cry baby
Just ride for me, ride for me
You said you'd die for me
Kill for me, kill for me
Just keep it real with me

[Chorus]
Go let all your friends know
This one thinks you're special
So go let all your friends know
We got something special

[Verse 3]
Girl you know how I get down
You know how we ride on the east side of town (6)
Can't even lie right now
Got me looking in your eyes when the guys around
And I love you lying down
But it take more than that to try and turn a lion down

[Chorus]
Go let all your friends know
This one thinks you're special
Go let all your friends know
I think that you're

[Outro]
I think one day I'll love you
And I'll need you
Baby I love you
I do, I do, I do
(Let nobody put you under)
