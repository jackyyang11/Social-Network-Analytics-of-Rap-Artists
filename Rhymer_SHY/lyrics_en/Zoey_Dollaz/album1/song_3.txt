[Hook]
I'm just tryna
Run through the money, run
I'm just tryna
Run through the money, run
I’m tryna blow a check
I'm tryna blow a check
Tryna pull up in a foreign
And make them niggas upset
Run through the money, run

[Verse 1]
I'm just tryna run through it
Heard them niggas makin threats, tell 'em come do it
All my niggas with the shits, even in the fist fight
Bet them niggas still gon' bring a gun to it
Yeah, I'm just tryna pull up in a 'vette
Hit the block, make 'em upset
I ain't done yet
Girl, I'm on a cash route
Mo'fuck love, young nigga tryna cash out
I'm on a money mission, bitch
You looking for attention tryna make a nigga kick it
So I can blow your back out
I ain't with the bullshit, I'm tryng to make some money
My niggas got kids and all of them babies hungry
Gotta feed them hittas, they the ones that come and get you
Just in case one of you pussy niggas wanna act funny

[Hook]
I'm just tryna
Run through the money, run
I'm just tryna
Run through the money, run
I’m tryna blow a check
I'm tryna blow a check
Tryna pull up in a foreign
And make them niggas upset
Run through the money, run

[Verse 2]
I'm just tryna run through the money
I'm just tryna run through the paper
I'm tryna get on, put my niggas on to the money
Have us all scream muhfuck a hater
We don't really fuck with them other guys
Middle finger up, screaming 'fuck the other side'
Them niggas ain't bout shit, they ain't really bout no money
If you ain't chasin' all this paper that's a suicide
Everyday I wake up, I think about a check
I remember I was broke and I ain't going back
That's why I'm running through his money
I be going through this paper like a mothafucking fool
I don't know act
Cause

[Hook: Zoey Dollaz]
I'm just tryna
Run through the money, run
I'm just tryna
Run through the money, run
I’m tryna blow a check
I'm tryna blow a check
Tryna pull up in a foreign
And make them niggas upset
Run through the money, run
Run through the money, run
Run through the money, run
