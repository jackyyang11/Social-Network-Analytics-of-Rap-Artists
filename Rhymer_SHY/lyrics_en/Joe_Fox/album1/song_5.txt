[Verse 1]
It's a kind of survival
Life and times in the world we know
Your each word is my bible
Your devotion it feeds my soul

[Chorus]
Sing a little sweet song for me
Help me with that melody
I'm so tired, of being so down
Tell me when you're coming around

[Verse 2]
Jumping into the water
Sink or swim I won't let you go
I am nobody's daughter
I am nobody's son for sure

[Chorus]
Sing a little sweet song for me
Help me with that melody
I'm so tired, of being this down
Tell me when you're coming around

[Chorus]
Sing a little sweet song for me
Help me with that melody
I'm so tired, of being this down
Tell me when you're coming around

[Outro]
I'm so tired, of being this down
Tell me when you're coming around
Tell me when you're coming
Tell me when you're coming
Tell me when you're coming around
