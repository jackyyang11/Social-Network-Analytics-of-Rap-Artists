[Verse 1]
Momma said "Boy you need to keep the faith"
Stay strong even when it slips away
Stay wise when you're younger
Hold on to the hunger
Broken, every part of me is used
I can fake it like I used to do
And the words tryna push me down
Way into the ground

[Chorus]
But I'm back like Jesus
I'm resurrected
I'm resurrected
Oh I'm back like Jesus
Oh I'm resurrected
I'm resurrected

[Verse 2]
One day all of this will have it's end
We'll see laughter in the sky again
Work out who is worth you
Cause they're all gonna hurt you
Momma said "Boy you need to keep the faith"
Stay strong even when life makes you pay
Stay strong through the cold and rain
And let go of your pain

[Chorus]
And I'm back like Jesus
I'm resurrected
I'm resurrected
Oh I'm back like Jesus
I'm resurrected
Oh I'm resurrected

[Post-Chorus]
Oh no, no
And nothing gonna hold me down
And nothing gonna hold me down
And nothing gonna hold me down
And nothing gonna hold me down

[Chorus]
Cause I'm back like Jesus
I'm resurrected
I'm resurrected
Oh I'm back like Jesus
I'm resurrected
I'm resurrected

[Post-Chorus]
Oh no, no
And nothing gonna hold me down
And nothing gonna hold me down
And nothing gonna hold me down
And nothing gonna hold me down
And nothing gonna hold me down
And nothing gonna hold me down
And nothing gonna hold me down
And nothing gonna hold me down
