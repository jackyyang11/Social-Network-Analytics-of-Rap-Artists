[Verse 1]
I'm gonna take you out tonight
Come see my friends
No heavy heart I feel alright
See where this ends
Some people spend their time with friends
I'm happy here
Just me and you, my sweetest blue
Color so clear

[Chorus]
Well I'm going out night walking
To see what it's all about
I need to go figure my insides out

[Verse 2]
And now I find I've left behind
All that I have
Dream of the sun, smoke in my lungs
Life ain't so bad
Some people spend their time with friends
I'm happy here
Just me and you, the streetlights too
Color so clear

[Chorus]
Well I'm going out night walking
To see what it's all about
I need to go figure my insides out

Yeah I like to go night walking
To see what this life's about
I need to go figure my insides out

[Bridge]
Hey, this life can wait
Hey, this life can wait
Hey, this life can wait
Hey, this life can wait

[Chorus]
I'm going to go night walking
See what it's all about
I need to go figure my insides out
