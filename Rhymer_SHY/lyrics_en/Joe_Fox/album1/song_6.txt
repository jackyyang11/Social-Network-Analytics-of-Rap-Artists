[Part 1]
She's in [?]
Someone's got to love someone more
I saw her power struggle
She stand [?] the [?] far too proud
To say we need eachother
Darling, so I know

[Hook]x2
This love, this love, this love won't last forever
This love, this love, this love won't last

[Part 2]
So hold your tongue
words cannot [?] the damage done
We'll only hurt eachother
So keep your drugs, keep your whine, whatever helps you pass the time
You've got your life and I've got mine, I love her
Darling, she's been told

[Hook]

[Part 3]
Still I cannot give up
I go to bed
and I sleep and I dream of love
my heart is frozen, stuck
I go to bed
and I sleep and I dream of you, I dream of you
Darling, she's been told

[Hook]x2
