[Verse 1]
I'm going out to see my friends
Won't be back 'til summer ends
Wanna lose myself
I never felt quite in the room
Every smile a new costume
I need a woman's help

[Chorus]
With my heavy load
No I don't care if I self-implode
We're gonna live 'til it's time to go
And take our place in that aftershow

[Verse 2]
I never felt quite in the room
Every smile a new costume
I wanna step outside
It's awful nice to see the sun
Live the life 'til morning comes
Learn to love the light

[Chorus]
With my heavy load
No I don't care if I self-implode
We're gonna live 'til it's time to go
And take our place in that aftershow

[Chorus]
With my heavy load
No I don't care if I self-implode
We're gonna live 'til it's time to go
And take our place in that aftershow

[Outro]
And take our place in that aftershow
And take our place in that aftershow
We're gonna live 'til it's time to go
We're gonna live and we won't grow old
