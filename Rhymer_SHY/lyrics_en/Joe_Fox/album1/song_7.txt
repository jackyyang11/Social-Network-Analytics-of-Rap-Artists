[Verse 1]
All the kids around my way
You bought that flake, get through the day
And I'm inside just countin' blues
Hiding from the TV news
Sex and drugs is all my pleasure
In this little life of leisure
A pretty girl, she don't believe
Anything she hears or sees

[Chorus]
Well, what's the word on the street?
What's the word on the street?
What's the word I need to tell myself
'Cause all these pills, they just ain't helpin' me
I can't think or see

[Verse 2]
Soon in love, we all succumb
You get nine lives and then you're done
But here they comes, your politician
Stage magician, little difference

[Chorus]
Well, what's the word on the street?
What's the word on the street?
I said, what's the word I need to tell myself
'Cause all these pills, they just ain't helpin' me

[Outro]
Well, what's the word on the street?
Ah tell me, what's the word on the street?
What's the word on street?
Ah tell me, what's the word on the street?
What's the word I need to tell myself
'Cause all these pills, they just ain't helpin' me
I can't fight the sea
What's the word I need to tell myself
All these pills, they just ain't helpin' me
