[Intro]
Well it's alright
I won't sleep tonight
Stare at the ceiling tiles
Crack a smile
Ooh you broke my spirit child
Maybe I'll be down
Have some friends around
Maybe head to town
Fuck around
With the sorrows, I can drown

[Pre-Chorus]
The thought of you still lingers in my head
But I can't seem to make it out my bed

[Chorus 1]
Well listen up Katie
You made a fool of me
You knock me off my feet
And I can't get no sleep

[Verse 2]
Baby, you cut me far too deep
Well maybe that's just luck
How we came unstuck
I won't make no fuss
I won't sweat or cuss
Or the mess you left of us
You tore my heart in two
Like only you could do
Enjoy in dating you
Now I'm blue
And you were only passing through

[Pre-Chorus]
The thought of you still lingers in my head
But I can't seem to make it out my bed

[Chorus 1]
Well listen up Katie
You made a fool of me
You knock me off my feet
And I can't get no sleep

[Bridge]
Well you cut me far too deep
Well now you cut me far far far too deep now dating you
Well you you cut me far far far too deep now dating you
Dating you

[Chorus 2]
Well listen up Katie
You made a mess of me
You knock me off my feet
And I won't get no sleep
Baby cut me so far deep

[Outro]
Here you come, Katie
Making a fool of me
Knocking me off my feet
And I can't get no sleep
Well listen up Katie
