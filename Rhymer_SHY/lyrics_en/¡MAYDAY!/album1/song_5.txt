[Intro: Wrekonize]
From a land far away I'm reaching out to my fam'
Each and every program, grown woman and man
Young child with the world in the palm of his hands
I beckon you to tune into this jam

[Verse 1: Wrekonize]
In a land that scans the F.M. for bandits
My beacon is bandwidth, my speakin' is sanskrit
I walk around the planet like it needs to be canvased
Paintin' everybody with this hedonist language
You need a transmitter so get off your damn twitter
This isn't a scam ninja, I'm tryin' to band with ya
We reach around the globe trying to open your blinds
And unplug your mind so you can fight

[Hook: Bernz]
Are you experienced?
Can you receive?
Are you antenna love?
You get my feed?
Are you experienced?
Can you receive? (Yeah, Yeah)
Are you antenna love?(Are you an antenna?)
Do you get my feed?

[Verse 2: Bernz]
Act 2 against gruesome, we lose 'em
Tell me how you busy wanna start a revolution
Ain't on the airwaves but I'm feeling like you're tuned in
First things first gotta find yourself and lose it
Dial into the movement, Surf into your mind
Tunnel in your psyche and you see you match mine
It's go time leave your weapons behind
See we've been waiting and we hoped you'd arrive
Now let's ride
Won't control nothing and nothing control many
Since cash is so petty, these thoughts are just pennies
Message in my sleep I'm seeing puzzles in my memories
Seeing riddles in the streets i gotta keep the car steady
Keep my eyes heavy while the jealous ones envy
Saw a vision in the night without the radio and telly
Tired of the output, then hoping that your ready
Cause it's time to get sweaty, now tell me

[Hook: Bernz]
Are you experienced? (Come on!)
Can you receive?
Are you antenna love?
You get my feed?
Are you experienced?
Can you receive?
Are you antenna love?
Do you get my feed?

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
Broad strokes break the broadcast
Shatter status that is the wrong mask
Please re-visit the program
Get high with your family down in the lowlands
In a economy of mixed autonomy
It's false ecology living with them wannabes
And we'd be lying if we said it's harmony
But it's the signal we hear

Came to anguish maintain the banquet
Round blocks and rooftops the name don't languish
The code is Morse now the station is anxious
Revolution in the air i hear it raving in Kansas
It's breaking in Broward, I hear it in South Day
The pirate radios been moving dials back now days
So next time you got the chance to drive in the dive
Re-tune your satellites to finally smile
