[Intro: Wrekonize]
Things ain稚 going my way
I might as well float away
Things ain稚 going my way
There痴 nothing much else to say
But just..

[Hook: Wrekonize]
Fly high by myself
I just wanna be alone
Get high by myself
I put myself on airplane mode
Woah-oh-oh-oh
I値l be back before you know
Woah-oh-oh-oh
I put myself in airplane mode

[Bridge: Bernz]
I知 so out of place, I知 so in my zone
I need an escape from here again
So give me some space and something to hold
I don稚 want to play pretend again
So if I could just turn off the world I know that things will be alright
I just need to catch, I just need to catch my breath cause I値l be in the sky tonight

[Verse 1: Bernz]
I知 all the way logged off
I知 sorry if I知 gone
I needed some space from all of the noise and all the distortion
I tried to find me a quiet place from all the misfortune
I値l see you when I get back from getting my float on

[Hook: Wrekonize]
Fly high by myself
I just wanna be alone
Get high by myself
I put myself on airplane mode
I fly high by myself
I just wanna be alone
Get high by myself
I put myself on airplane mode
Woah-oh-oh-oh
I値l be back before you know
Woah-oh-oh-oh
I put myself in airplane mode

[Bridge: Wrekonize]
I知 so out of place, I知 so in my zone
I need an escape from here again
So give me some space and something to hold
I don稚 want to play pretend again
So if I could just turn off this world around me, everything will be alright
I just need to catch my breath so if you need me, I値l be in the sky tonight

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
I知 under the bridge and in the clouds rolling around
Nobody is taking me down, I知 off the line now
So if you need me on the ground you値l have to reach up to the stars
See I知 in airplane mode, I got no time to speak to y誕ll
I just...

[Hook: Wrekonize]
Fly high by myself
I just wanna be alone
Get high by myself
I put myself on airplane mode
I fly high by myself
I just wanna be alone
Get high by myself
I put myself on airplane mode
Woah-oh-oh-oh
I値l be back before you know
Woah-oh-oh-oh
I put myself in airplane mode
Woah-oh-oh-oh
I値l be back before you know
Woah-oh-oh-oh
I put myself in airplane mode
