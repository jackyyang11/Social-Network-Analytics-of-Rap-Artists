[Bridge]
Against my better judgement I'm back where I was, was
Was this what you want?
Against my better Judgement I'mma see you again
And I don't know where I'll be
Against my better judgement I'mma let you back in

[Hook]
Cause I don't know what else to do
Will you help me through?
There's so much that I've got to lose
And it all starts with you
It all starts with you

[Verse 1: Bernz]]
Say you let go of me, what will become of me then?
Say I just walk away, and it can just start again
I've been addicted to all of your lies, cause the truth is I'm broken within
The little that I can remember, I try and forget before I go to bed
Soon as I see you there I need to escape you again

[Hook]

[Bridge + Hook]

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
Another bottle on the mind, but it bothers me that I’m just leaning on the side of substance
Like it’s modelin' my pride, and stopping me from prime
I’ve given not a single fuck since
My friends are burning memories away, while I just keep drowning in my stress
And we said it's ride or die, but we're all high whenever life is stressful

[Hook]

[Outro]
I will need you to tell me the time
Don't you worry cause I'm doing just fine
Pay no mind, I'm ignoring the signs
Well, at least I will until the end of the night
To find me I must lose you, but it feels worse than losing it all
Against my better judgement
Against my better judgement of all (x4)
