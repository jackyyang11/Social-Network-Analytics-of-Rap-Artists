[Intro]
Yeah, this is a story of a famous dog
For the dog that chases its tail will be dizzy
These are clapping dogs, rhythmic dogs
Harmonic dogs, house dogs, street dogs
Dog of the world unite - dancin dogs
Yeah, countin dogs, funky dogs
Nasty dogs (dog)
Atomic dog
Atomic dog

[Refrain]
Life on all fours
When you're out there walking the streets
May compete
Nothin' but the dog in ya

[Bridge]
Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yeah
Bow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yeah
Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yeah
Bow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yeah

[Verse 1]
(Life on all fours)
Un-tied dog in a telematic society
(When you're out there walking the streets)
Ain't your average huckleberry hound
(May compete
Nothin' but the dog in ya)
Why must I feel like that?
Why must I chase the cat?
Darn the dog in me

[Refrain]
Life on all fours
When you're out there walking the streets
May compete
Nothin' but the dog in ya

[Chorus]
Why must I feel like that?
Why must I chase the cat
Nothing but the dog in me
Why must I feel like that?
Why must I chase the cat
Nothing but the dog in me
Why must I feel like that?
Why must I chase the cat
Nothing but the dog in me
Why must I feel like that?
Why must I chase the cat
Nothing but the dog in me

[Refrain 2]
Do the dogcatcher, dogcatcher
Do the dogcatcher
Do the dogcatcher, dogcatcher
Do the dogcatcher
(Dog, dog, dog)
Do the dogcatcher
Baby do the dogcatcher, oh

[Chorus]
Why must I feel like that?
Why must I chase the cat
Nothing but the dog in me
Why must I feel like that?
Why must I chase the cat
Nothing but the dog in me

[Bridge]
Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yeah
Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yeah
Bow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yeah
Just walkin' the dog!
Oh, atomic dog

[Interlude]
Futuristic bow-wow
Leader of the pack
Wild dog

[Chorus]
Why must I feel like that?
Why must I chase the cat?
Just the dog in me
Nothin' but the dog in me
Why must I feel like that?
Why must I chase the cat?
Just the dog in me
Nothin' but the dog in me
Why must I feel like that?
Why must I chase the cat?
Just the dog in me
Dog in me, dog is in me
Talking dogs, dog's in me

[Refrain 2]
Do the dogcatcher, dogcatcher
Do the dogcatcher
Do you wanna do the dogcatcher
Well, baby, why don't you do it again for me
Dogcatcher, dogcatcher
Do the dogcatcher

[Outro]
House-trained dogs
Wild dogs
Say it again
Why must I feel like that?
Why must I chase the cat?
