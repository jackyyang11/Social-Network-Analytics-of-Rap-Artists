Ain't that peculiar baby?
Ain't that peculiar baby?
Ain't that peculiar?

You, you, you, you, you
You do me wrong but I'm still crazy 'bout you
Stay away too long and I can't do without you
Every chance you get you seem to hurt me more and more
But each hurt makes my love grow stronger than before

I know flowers grow from rain
But how can love grow from pain baby?
Now ain't that peculiar? Peculiar as can be
(Ain't that peculiar? Ain't that peculiar?)
Ain't that peculiar baby? Peculiarity
(Ain't that peculiar? Ain't that peculiar?)

You tell me lies that should be obvious to me
But I'm so much in love with you baby that I don't wanna see
That the things you do and say are designed to make me blue
Doggone shame my love for you makes all your lies seem true

If truth makes love last longer
Why do lies make mine stronger, oh baby?
Ain't that peculiar? Peculiarity
(Ain't that peculiar, peculiar?)
Ain't that peculiar? Peculiar as can be
(Ain't that peculiar?)

Ain't it peculiar baby? Peculiar as can be
(Ain't that peculiar? Ain't that peculiar?)
Ain't that peculiar?
Ain't that peculiar? Peculiarity

I know love can last through years
But how can my love laugh through tears?
I know love can last through years
But how can love laugh through tears?

Ain't it peculiar baby?
(Ain't that peculiar? Ain't that peculiar?)

Ain't that peculiar? Ain't that peculiar?
Ain't that peculiar? That's all I can do baby

Ain't that peculiar? Ain't that peculiar?
Ain't that peculiar? Ain't that peculiar?
Ain't that peculiar? Ain't that peculiar?
Ain't that peculiar?
