Feel the poppin´ in your ears
In the air when you´re flying
And you finally get the feeling
This is where you belong
There is nothin´ on this earth
That can take you higher, higher
And you finally get to see
You´re soaring out on your own
Airbound
Oh me, oh my
Airbound
You probably never thought yourself
As being much of a pilot
There´s a million buttons
Easy over at the controls
Yawnin´ in the cockpit
Time for take-off
Racin´ rocket motors
And you´re ´bout to explode
Airbound
Oh me, oh my
Oh me, oh my
Airbound
Feel the poppin´ in your ears
In the air when you´re flying
And you finally get the feeling
This is where you belong
There is nothin´ on this earth
That can take you higher
And you finally get to see
You´re soaring out on your own
We gone, we gone, we gone, we gone
Never to come down
You probably never thought yourself
As being much of a pilot
There´s a million easy
Buttons over at the controls
Yawnin´ in the cockpit
Time for take-off
Racing rocket motors
And you´re about to explode
Airbound
Oh me, oh my
Airbound
Feel the poppin´ in your ears
In the air when you´re flying
And you finally get the feeling
This is where you belong
There is nothin´ on this earth
That can take you higher
And you finally get to see
You´re soaring out on your own
We gone, we gone, we gone, we gone
Never to ever come down
