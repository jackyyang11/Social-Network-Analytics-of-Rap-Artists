There's somethin' different about you
And there's a look in your eyes
It says true love has finally found you
And given you back your smile
I'm sorry I couldn't love you
The way I always meant to
Now there's someone else to play that part

I hope he comforts the child in your heart
I hope he understands the woman you are
May he never take for granted
The little things that make love work
And most of all I hope he's all that you deserve

I hear the way you talk about him
And suddenly it's oh so clear
It's time for me to learn to move on
Though deep in my heart you're still there
But I wanna see you happy
Even if it means without me
If there's someone else to play that part

I hope he comforts the child in your heart
I hope he understands the woman you are
May he never take for granted
The little things that make love work
And most of all I hope he's all that you deserve

Now and forever you will always be
Someone who owns a place inside of me
The only way I can let you know
Is by letting go, now as I let you go

I hope he comforts the child in your heart
I hope he understands the woman you are
May he never take for granted
The little things that make love work
And most of all I hope he's all that you deserve

Most of all, I wish you all that you deserve
All that you deserve
