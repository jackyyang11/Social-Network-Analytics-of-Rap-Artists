A hundred times I have walked out the door
Just to walk back a hundred times more
A thousand nights I have sworn not to stay, ooooh oh
I remained tangles in the chains of desire, oooh
I know that it's no good, I shouldn't be here
I know, I should leave you

Shouldn't let you close to me
Shouldn't have this hold on me
No, I shouldn't be so weak
But a heart can only be so strong
Every time I try to go
Just one look in your eyes, I know
That a heart can only be so strong
A heart can only be so strong

A hundred ways you have captured my soul
I can't hold on but I can't let go
Your spell on me is a spell I can't break, ooooh oh
All my strength burningin the flames of desire, oooh
I don't wanna stay here, I don't wanna leave you
Don't know how to leave you

Shouldn't let you close to me
Shouldn't have this hold on me
No, I shouldn't be so weak
But a heart can only be so strong
Every time I try to go
Just one look in your eyes, I know
That a heart can only be so strong
A heart can only be so strong

Wooh, (so strong), ooh so strong
I can't let go, oh no
Wooh, so strong...
'Cause you're a part of my soul
And I, I can't escape you
No matter how hard I try
I can never be free
Of your hold on me (so strong)
I can't let go, oh

A hundred times I have walked out the door
Just to walk back a hundred times more

Shouldn't let you close to me
Shouldn't have this hold on me
No, I shouldn't be so weak
But a heart can only be so strong
Every time I try to go
Just one look in your eyes, I know
That a heart can only be so strong
A heart can only be so strong

Shouldn't let you close to me
Shouldn't have this hold on me
But a heart can only be so strong
Every time I try to go
Just one look in your eyes I know
That a heart can only be (so strong) so strong
A heart can only be so strong, oooh
A heart can only be so strong...
