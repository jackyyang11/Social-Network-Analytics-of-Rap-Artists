[Chorus]
Big bands, I'mma do a show in the A
Big house, I'mma do a show in the A
Bedroom, I'mma throw some hoes in the A
Bust it open, I'mma throw the pole in the A
Big bands, I'mma do a show in the A
Big house, I'mma do a show in the A
Bedroom, I'mma throw some hoes in the A
Bust it open, I'mma throw the pole in the A

[Verse 1]
I done been to every state that's in the USA
It was me and Ben Frank, no AKA
I was racin' to the money, that's the Tay K way
Now, I'm a young, rich dummy, bitch, ay, ay, ay
You want a feature hit, key, and bitch, wired a fee
Niggas bitin' off their chain like I hired a thief
Lou wouldn't ask God who was higher than me
He replied, "These niggas dry on the streets and they be lyin' on beats"
Statin' facts or we makin' believe?
Chain Chang but ain't no Asian in me
Ain't got fade on the weave
But all the clubs make sure I cheat
My son stay with bank rolls on him
I keep a pole on me
You ain't never did three months straight festivals
Bitches know my name and wanna suck my dirty testicles
Pockets full of celery and I don't do the vegetables
K rolled the fuck out that lil' nigga, I'm with the stretchables

[Chorus]
Big bands, I'mma do a show in the A
Big house, I'mma do a show in the A
Bedroom, I'mma throw some hoes in the A
Bust it open, I'mma throw the pole in the A
Big bands, I'mma do a show in the A
Big house, I'mma do a show in the A
Bedroom, I'mma throw some hoes in the A
Bust it open, I'mma throw the pole in the A

[Verse 2]
It's money by my side and my main bitch kissin'
They put on a show, and no, it ain't no intermission
Evict you with this chopper, landlord, and you the tenant
We get cash for your gold, I might just strip you for the pendant
I got a AR and a baby bitch, that's two types of extensions
Remember, I was broke and I'd do anything to get it
Hop up out your house, it's like I'm comin' for a visit
Then I turn into a tanker like my name was Matt Dillon
If I ain't got no money in my hands, it ain't no feelin's
Your baby daddy's a pussy, he got invisible killin's
Feed the pit some gunpowder, let him get to hittin'
Blue cheese, no ranch, I'm still dippin'
Still put a condom on my dick for when you lick it
I just did a festival out in London, and it was wicked
Why are you concerned with all this money I'm gettin'?
I'mma hit another bitch, all just to make her ass a victim

[Chorus]
Big bands, I'mma do a show in the A
Big house, I'mma do a show in the A
Bedroom, I'mma throw some hoes in the A
Bust it open, I'mma throw the pole in the A
Big bands, I'mma do a show in the A
Big house, I'mma do a show in the A
Bedroom, I'mma throw some hoes in the A
Bust it open, I'mma throw the pole in the A
