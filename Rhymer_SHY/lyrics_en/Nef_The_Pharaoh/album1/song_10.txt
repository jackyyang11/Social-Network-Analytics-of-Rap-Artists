[Intro: Nef The Pharaoh]
Still smokin' this fat woods
(wrigh wright wright wright)

[Verse 1: Nef The Pharaoh]
Bitch look at my motherfuckin' neck (at my neck)
She see me in the traffic and she wrecked
These rapper niggas want some money come Stretch
Make one false move and get left (pow pow pow)
You was PC'd up with no rec time
While I was at the bank like is check time (Get money)
Chang the barber, bitch I cut every line
Karo'ing nerds, its cut every time
You pussy boys smell like hella period
With the gold plated chains you can't be serious (what the fuck)
Fake thugs don’t put no fear in us
The only one I fear ain't here with us, God
Icy neck full of rocks, bitch I wear what made the titanic stop
Where was you at when we was gettin' on cops
From tryna stop niggas from tryna cop that glittery shit

[Chorus: Nef The Pharaoh]
Look at my neck bling blaow (woah)
Look at my neck bling blaow, blindin' (woah)
Look at my neck bling blaow (woah)
Look at my neck bling blaow, shinin' (woah)
Look at my neck bling blaow (woah)
Look at my neck bling blaow, blindin' (woah)
Look at my neck bling blaow (woah)
Look at my neck bling blaow, shinin' (woah)

[Verse 2: Slimmy B & Nef the Pharaoh]
Why your bottom bitch got a nigga a neck froze? (Drownin')
Diamonds changin' colors like a gecko
Bling-Blaow, V.V.S make my chest glow
Fake nigga, snake nigga, thuggin' let that TEC go
Run up with that bullshit, now all his chest gone
For a long time, I was the same nigga slept on
950 Yeezys, broke bitches get stepped on
And for my nigga Chang Chang, I let that TEC blow
Real north nigga, never been a dork nigga
Why fonk with y'all? You the type to go to court, nigga
Fuck a Honda Civic I'm a droptop Porsche nigga
Four, Five heatstick bounce out and torch niggas
SOB, bitch if you ain't gang don't pronounce it
Jiggin' for them Ps, nigga we don't flip ounces
It's money over here, broke bitch don't come around us
Diamonds like water, I got a young nigga drownin'

[Chorus: Nef The Pharaoh]
Look at my neck bling blaow (woah)
Look at my neck bling blaow, blindin' (woah)
Look at my neck bling blaow (woah)
Look at my neck bling blaow, shinin' (woah)
Look at my neck bling blaow (woah)
Look at my neck bling blaow, blindin' (woah)
Look at my neck bling blaow (woah)
Look at my neck bling blaow, shinin' (woah)

[Verse 3: Nef The Pharaoh]
Shinin' like a crystal ball, I'm finna break dance
Nigga touch me? He won't make it
Where your diamonds at? I cannot see 'em in the dark
You a Sharpie, it ain't a compliment, I'm callin' you a mark
Dipped in butter, all the hoes flutter
My neck is on (wow), your neck is on (shut up)
You the type of nigga that scared of the diamond tester
And I'm the type of the nigga that fuck your bitch off in the Tesla
I'ma Sick Wid It soldier, Neffy took over
You got your jewellery from the middle of the mall, I see you post
It go twinkle-twinkle, punk ass star (punk ass star)
How come your diamonds don't hit that hard?
My shit hit like a pimp on his broad
My shit hit like bass in the car
She tryin' to race to the car, made her give me face in the car
I don't need a flashlight, I use my chain in the dark (whoa)

[Chorus: Nef The Pharaoh]
Look at my neck bling blaow (woah)
Look at my neck bling blaow, blindin' (woah)
Look at my neck bling blaow (woah)
Look at my neck bling blaow, shinin' (woah)
Look at my neck bling blaow (woah)
Look at my neck bling blaow, blindin' (woah)
Look at my neck bling blaow (woah)
Look at my neck bling blaow, shinin' (woah)
