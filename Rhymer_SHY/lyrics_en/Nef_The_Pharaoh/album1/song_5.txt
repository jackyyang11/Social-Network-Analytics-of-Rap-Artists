[Chorus]
Beat slappin', knockin' like a bass head
Fifteens in the trunk for the basement
Spaceship, bad bitches online
Fresh kicks, T'ing in on mine
Beat slappin', knockin' like a bass head
Fifteens in the trunk for the basement
Spaceship, bad bitches online
Sick with it, keep it lit on mine

[Verse 1]
I take a trip to Dubai and had Arabian nights
He tried to sell it for the high but then he lowered the price
I'm in the sky with the kites, I like puss like dykes
Never turn down a fight, I put that on my life
Yeah the hood getting ugly, I can see the struggle
How you say you from the hood? We never see each other
And my wood I'm smoking purp, Miss Celie color
Pookie that's my blood cousin, treat him like my fuckin' brother
I done came down like an H-Town nigga
My assassins gon' kill you if I don't fuck with you
I'm a backwood baby but I started smokin' swishers
I ain't gon' lie, I went to Inderkum High, I'm the guy in my time

[Chorus]
Beat slappin', knockin' like a bass head
Fifteens in the trunk for the basement
Spaceship, bad bitches online
Fresh kicks, T'ing in on mine
Beat slappin', knockin' like a bass head
Fifteens in the trunk for the basement
Spaceship, bad bitches online
Sick with it, keep it lit on mine

[Verse 2]
Yeah I moved to Sacramento in 2009
Then I lost my grandma, it was the roughest of times
But I stuck with the grind, it didn't fuck with my mind
I got a path to complete, I wasn't cuttin' no lines
Man I was the only motherfucker makin' songs about Natomas
Now everybody and they mama actin' like they know me
Bitches callin' me homie, randoms callin' me they brodie
I just want some peace and quiet, get the blank face emoji
And I wish a motherfucker would say he made this
I got a lot of niggas pissed, boy you ain't made shit
Audi 5, good vibes, chillin' in my spaceship
With an outer space chick, finna get my duck sicked

[Chorus]
Beat slappin', knockin' like a bass head
Fifteens in the trunk for the basement
Spaceship, bad bitches online
Fresh kicks, T'ing in on mine
Beat slappin', knockin' like a bass head
Fifteens in the trunk for the basement
Spaceship, bad bitches online
Sick with it, keep it lit on mine
