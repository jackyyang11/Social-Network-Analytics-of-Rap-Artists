[Intro: Nef The Pharoah]
Fuckin' stupid ass casinos
Dumbass clubs
DTB on a beat that's bro

[Bridge: Nef The Pharoah]
86, 86 out that bitch
I got kicked out that bitch
But I bet I'm still lit
They try to ban me from the club I be finnessin' in
I had to switch the outfit up to get the weapon in

[Verse 1: Nef The Pharoah]
Do your dog granny bad cuz I ain't got one
That lil nigga that fucked yo daughter ya that's my son
I'm 86 out the crimewell but oh well
Dropped the fo' in my Jones like I'm Donell
You far from hood if they don't know you at the hood sto'
At them bitches you be wit make you look like a hoe
I seen you tuck yo' chains in when we was in the club
You was glad I got kicked out the life of a scrub
Fuck that shit imma turn it up in the parking lot
Can't even do a show at home if I ain't got my Glock
The spot smell like stank pussy and burnt perm
And imma spaz on a smokey like I'm Big Worm
Your germ bullets got no name but bitch yours earned
Cremate his ass no pass put him in an urn
Yo boyfriend a straight bitch I heard the nigga ran a play and got picked

[Chorus: Nef The Pharoah & Cuban Doll]
86, 86 out that bitch
I got kicked out that bitch
But I bet I'm still lit
They try to ban me from the club I be finnessin' in
I had to switch the outfit up to get the weapon in
86, 86 out that bitch
I got kicked out that bitch (ay)
But I bet I'm still lit (huh?)
They try to ban me from the club I be finnessin' in (hell nah)
I had to switch the outfit up to get the weapon in (ew)

[Verse 2: Cuban Doll]
Walked up in this bitch day check me at the door (what)
I brought my Glock from my brother but that's on the low (yeah)
We can't kill you in the club we catch you at the sto' (bitch)
But we still brought it in just to let you know
When I rock wit' opp hoes get yo' pilot shot hoes
No we [?] drop tho slide on yo' block wit the draco like a mop hoe
You want beef?
Get the meat I got yo' muthafuckin' taco
Bitch

[Chorus: Nef The Pharoah, Cuban Doll, & ALLBLACK]
86, 86 out that bitch (ay)
I got kicked out that bitch
But I bet I'm still lit
They try to ban me from the club I be finnessin' in
I had to switch the outfit up to get the weapon in
86, 86 out that bitch (yuh)
I got kicked out that bitch (huh)
But I bet I'm still lit (meffin')
They try to ban me from the club I be finnessin' in
I had to switch the outfit up to get the weapon in

[Verse 3: ALLBLACK]
You ain't gotta check it out here with all that blasé blasé
Call me Usher we gon' do shit my way
Niggas hate me but the groupies love me like I'm DeVante
No time for sleep I gotta play on the highway
In St. Louis wit' doonie I got the purple buds
Gave OG the home price I really fuck with cuz
My nickname in every state is The Cali Plug
My second home is Atlanta first is the Dubs
Blue flames to a section only me and scrub
I feel like Dreezy in the club how they showin' love
Killas wit' me in Chicago and the dirty glove
Track and field on these beats how I'm finna run
I'm wit' Nef and DTB shorty wrists all flood
I said dub top three dub for lil peezy blood
I got a pair for yo' fish add another one
That's 86 took off the star cuz the Glock ain't tucked

[Outro: Nef The Pharoah]
86, 86 out that bitch
I got kicked out that bitch
But I bet I'm still lit
They try to ban me from the club I be finnessin' in
I had to switch the outfit up to get the weapon in
86, 86 out that bitch
I got kicked out that bitch
But I bet I'm still lit
They try to ban me from the club I be finnessin' in
I had to switch the outfit up to get the weapon in
