[Verse]
It goes pop-pop-pop when it's coming out my asshole
And it feels good, and it feels good (it feels good)
And it feels good, and it feels good, tonight
(I broke a dog's neck)
In the darkest of times
You're there for me (I love you)
In the darkest of times
These anal beads take care of me (they take care of me)
Shove it up real good (please?)
Now it kinda hurts (ww)
Oh, no! (there's a lot of blood)
And I need an ambulance! (oh my god, it's huge)
Call the ambulance! (someone needs to kill that thing)

[Hook]
Now my ass is bleeding
Ass is bleeding, ass is bleeding
Ass is bleeding, ass is bleeding

Ain't nothing wrong with that
Ain't nothing wrong with that
Ain't nothing wrong with that
Ain't nothing wrong with that

My ass is bleeding
Ass is bleeding, ass is bleeding
Ass is bleeding, ass is bleeding
Ass is bleeding, ass is bleeding
Ass is bleeding
Ass is bleeding, ass is bleeding
Ass is bleeding
