[Intro]
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
Mamma mia, mamma mia, mamma mia, mamma mia
I be making fucking dough in the pizzeria
It's a spicy meatball, give you diarrhea
Popping bars like the mozzarella sticks I eat, uh
Oh, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

[Verse]
The game must be a girl 'cause I'm always in it
I had em running like a track meet passing around excuses
Like a fuckin' baton, your grammar sucks, you run on
Like girls missing periods, a double entendre
For the family, get fisted like Elmo
Slap away the hands like "hell no"
Jokes drier than the elbows on an ethnic man
Drop more jaws than guillotines in the 1800's, damn
Yo, the MSG of the rap game
Very little substance but the flavor is insane
I just wanted food, never needed a big name
So fuck you if you think I'm killing shit for fame, 'cause ew
Scholars call it cheating when I call it cutting work ethics
Peter North, no shortcomings, I'm trying to fuck some Rosetta girls
Get it through the spine, girl, like an epidural
Get it on your face, girl, like a Pollock mural
Fuck your shit, man, I'm harder than a cock-a-doodle
Oh man, oh man
Who the fuck you think is making the coin
I don't give a fuck about your little bitches, your point
I'm on a whole 'nother level, fucking moms in a joint
You dirty cunts, why you being such a faggot, kid?
Holy fuck, man, you're being such a faggot, kid
Yep, and I've been doing business on the low
I got evicted so I got myself a bungalow
She hold my dick under the table like a puppet show
I'm fucking models everyday, my dick's a runway, hoe
My dick's a runway, hoe

[Chorus]
Mamma mia, mamma mia, mamma mia, mamma mia
I be making fucking dough in the pizzeria
It's a spicy meatball, give you diarrhea
Popping bars like the mozzarella sticks I eat, uh

[Bridge]
When I'm finished in the kitchen, man, I never clean up
I sit at home with my dough with my feet up

[Chorus]
Mamma mia, mamma mia, mamma mia, mamma mia
I be making fucking dough in the pizzeria
Mamma fucking mia, mamma fucking mia, mamma fucking mia
I be making fucking dough up in the pizzeria
The dough smell so nasty, boy, I don't eat it
The dough smell like my dick, man, the girls eat it
Ah, ah
Fuck that
