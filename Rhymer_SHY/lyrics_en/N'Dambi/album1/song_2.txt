I don't know why I keep fuckin' with you
When you spend my money
Should I keep running home?
Fuckin' with you

At times it's funny
But I keep runnin' home, fuckin' with you
They tell me run, leave, but I won't
I keep on, I keep fuckin' with you

I can't hardly wait to be through with you
Hardly wait, still I'm fuckin' with you
I can't hardly wait to be through with you
Hardly wait, still I'm fuckin' with you

You don't celebrate me
Oh, but I keep fuckin' with you
You go out but never with me
Still I keep on fuckin' with you

You're always competin'
And I keep right on fuckin' with you
And I've started resenting
But I keep right on fuckin' with you

I can't hardly wait to be through with you
Hardly wait, still I'm fuckin' with you
I can't hardly wait to be through with you
Hardly wait, still I'm fuckin' with you

Now when I get up, I'm not comin' back
Then you'll realize I was the best you ever had
So in love with being in love
And it's the only thing I'm thinking of

When I get this monkey off of me
I bet one day I'm gon' leave
So don't tell me you love me
'Cause I keep right on fuckin' with you

Just to please me 'cause I fucked with you
The fact remains is that I keep right on fuckin' with you
And you ain't changed, but I keep right on
I keep fuckin' with you

I can't hardly wait to be through with you
Hardly wait, still I'm fuckin' with you
I can't hardly wait to be through with you
Hardly wait, still I'm fuckin' with you

Fuckin' with you
Ooh baby, I keep fuckin' with you
Fuckin' with you
You, you, you, you, you, you
I keep fuckin' with you

I can't hardly wait to be through with you
I can't hardly wait, still I'm fuckin' with you
I can't hardly wait, still I'm
Hardly wait, fuckin' with you

Sayin' so much to clean up, but I'll feel so much better without you
Fuckin' with you
Say I can't wait to get up, but sometimes this is what love makes us do
Fuckin' with you

Can't wait, can't wait, I can't wait
I still love you
Can't wait, can't wait, I can't wait
One day you will realized
Can't wait, can't wait, I can't wait
I still love you
Can't wait, can't wait, I can't wait
Can't wait, can't wait, I can't wait
I still love you
