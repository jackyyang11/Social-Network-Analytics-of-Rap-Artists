Verse 1
You say this as good as it gets
But baby I must admit that I expect, oh, a whole lot more from you
Darlin’ I do
I want the sun, the moon, the stars
And a first-class trip to Mars
All on a hot air balloon coming soon
Your so comfortable with the stop we made
Too happy now with your sun in the shade and
I wash my hands with tryna help you see
The you that you could be
Maybe it was in my dreams
In my dreams
Chorus
So go on
See you later
You’re not the man I used to know
You’re an Imitator
Go on
See you later
You’re not the man I used to know
You’re an Imitator
Imitator (Imitator) uh-ooo
Imitator (Imitator) uh-hooo
Imitator (Imitator)mm-mmm
Imitator (Imitator)mmm-mmm
Verse 2
I think of all the times you fronted on me
Had me convinced o’ your make believe
Yes I believed it
Cause it sounded true
But daddy this love alone is not that strong
For both of us to be leanin’ on
For it was never you, no never you
Your so comfortable with the stop we made
Too happy now with your sun in the shade and
My drive alone can’t fuel one that iss not your own
No, and I know it now
I know it now
Chorus
So go on
See you later
You’re not the man I used to know
You’re an Imitator
Go on
See you later
You’re not the man I used to know
You’re an Imitator
Imitator (Imitator) uh-ooo
Imitator (Imitator)
Imitator (Imitator)oh yeah
Imitator (Imitator)ooo-ooh
Bridge
I think I love you too much
For me to see the you standin in front of me
I thought you were my favorite song
But you’re in a different key
Verse 3
All the attention I gave to this mess we made
I had the hardest time believing it was really you
Really you
See you lied to yourself and told everyone else
What we wanted to hear
Now it’s all to clear
Your just to comfortable with the stop you made
Too happy now with your sun in the shade and
I hope you find that one thing one thing that makes you happy
Cause it can’t be me
Chorus
Go on
See you later
You’re not the man I used to know
You’re an Imitator
Go on
See you later
You’re not the man I used to know
You’re an Imitator
Imitator (Imitator) oh yeah
Imitator (Imitator) uh-huuuh
Imitator (Imitator)oh yea
Imitator (Imitator)oooo
Vamp out
You’re not the man I used to know, no no no no (Imitator)
Tell me who are you (Imitator)
Who are you, who are you
You’re not the man I used to know, no no no no no no
Who are you, babe, who are you, mmm
Imitator
