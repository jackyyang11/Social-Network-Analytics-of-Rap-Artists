[Verse 1 - Renée]
So I've composed a little rap, a little rhyme
If you will grant me one more moment of your time
Before you slip out through your seats and walk down all those stairs
May I tell you 'bout Broadway Cares?
A charity that we all support
For so many, they are the last resort

[Verse 2 - Renée]
Broadway Cares gives to other charities
To one in particular Imma share with you
It's called Graham Windham
(Graham Windham)
In case you didn't know
That's the orphanage Eliza started years ago
They do so much for so many in need
So we do what we can so that they succeed
If you'd like to help, here's what you do
See a red bucket?
Drop in a bill or two

[All]
See a red bucket?
Drop in a bill or two
See a red bucket?
Drop in a bill or two

[Verse 3 - Renée]
A Washington, a Hamilton, a Lincoln, a Jackson
Or swipe a credit card if that gives you more satisfaction
Swipe it at the bar
And while you're there, you will find
A Hamilton playbill that we have all signed
It's also signed by Questlove and Black Thought from The Roots
Don't miss your shot
Three hundred dollars each, cause there are just a few
But we got signed posters too

[All]
We got signed posters too
We got signed posters too

[Verse 4 - Renée]
And one more thing, before we're through
We've loved sharing this time with you

[All]
We've loved sharing this time with you
We love sharing this time with you
