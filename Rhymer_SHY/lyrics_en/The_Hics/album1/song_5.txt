[Verse 1]
Tangle, be close
Just go
Too close
Confined to illusion, pulling me in
Dissolving before me, about to give in

[Hook]
Stay, stay
We fade in vain
Replace my blame
Hold safe
We fade, we fade

[Verse 2]
I hold on
I've lost
Control
Confined to a memory, pulling me in
Fading before me, about to wade in

[Hook]
Stay, stay
We fade in vain
Replace my blame
Hold safe
We fade, we fade

[Bridge]
To know your flaws, I fear our thoughts
To know your flaws, I fear our thoughts
To know your flaws, I fear our thoughts
To know your, to know your, to know your
To know

To know your flaws, I fear our thoughts
To know your, to know your, to know your
To know

[Hook]
Stay, stay
We fade in vain
Replace my blame
Hold safe
We fade, we fade
