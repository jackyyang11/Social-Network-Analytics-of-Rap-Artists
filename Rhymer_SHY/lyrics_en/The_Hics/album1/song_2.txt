[Intro]
If only I could feel your stare now, ooh
Cold air

[Verse 1]
He keeps in shadow
Once warm now ceases to thaw
My offering was simple
Yet it lead to our downfall
In the tireless slumber, suffering from withdrawal
And now I see your silence signs
All along was love in your eyes

[Chorus]
If only I could feel your stare now, ooh
Cold air
If only you would let me in now, ooh
Cold air
If only I could feel your stare now, ooh
Cold air
If only you would let me in now, ooh
Cold air

[Verse 2]
Right into darkness, open look
Silence feeling behind
Looking for a sign to find the secret you're keeping
It always... and you always seems to keep me from...
You and I will sleep until it dies
Nothing left to...

[Pre-Chorus]
Falling to the ground
Falling to the ground

[Chorus]
If only I could feel your stare now, ooh
Cold air
If only you would let me in now, ooh
Cold air
If only I could feel your stare now, ooh
Cold air
If only you would let me in now, ooh
Cold air
