[Verse 1]
Same, it goes, so, slow
Time, it goes, so, slow

[Interlude]
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh

[Verse 2]
Take, your, bow
Stay, down
When it comes to the peak of it
Pull out

[Hook]
For all those who just, just lie
For all those who just, just lie
For all those who just, just lie
For all those who just, just lie

[Bridge]
Still waiting for an open ground
Flies tame your mind unfound
Helpless in what you know
There's thought I've never shown
Signs sold your way to me
Your lies unfound beneath
Your cryin' is out of reach
Distance is all we need


[Hook]
For all those who just, just lie
For all those who just, just lie
For all those who just, just lie
For all those who just, just lie

[Outro]
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
