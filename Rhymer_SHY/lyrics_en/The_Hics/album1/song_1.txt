I've met these thoughts before
Uncharted waters rising
I feel it in my bones
Too deep for me to ignore
These crossroads

Held back by what I thought was right
Keeping my feelings from your mind
Too deep you bring my fears alive
Too quick to notice fading time
Your faith too blind to let me go
Visions of clinging onto those
Beautiful times as we approach
Our final chord

I feel your loneliness
With every step I take to walk away
All we'll know is just how good it felt
Before we broke this little lie they call love

I'm tryin' to pretend
Searching for ways to keep you
No longer can I defend
Just to be let down again
By you

Held back by what I thought was right
Keeping my feelings from your mind
Too deep you bring my fears alive
Too quick to notice fading time
Your faith too blind to let me go
Visions of clinging onto those
Beautiful times as we approach
Our final chord

I feel your loneliness
With every step I take to walk away
All we'll know is just how good it felt
Before we broke this little lie they call love

Searching for ways keep you
No longer can I defend just to
Be let down again, by you
'Cause I can see your will from your heart

I feel your loneliness
With every step I take to walk away
All we'll know is just how good it felt
Before we broke this little lie they call love [x 2]
