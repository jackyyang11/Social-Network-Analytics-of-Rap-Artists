[Hook]
Time to kill the lights
Erase the line
To distance your soul from mine
Search for the divine to find your soul
The soul that encaptured mine
The soul that encaptured mine
The soul that encaptured mine

[Verse 1]
Blue for beauty
To the depth to the room
Masking my intentions
With these false pretenses

[Pre-Chorus]
Love, love, love, loss
Found love, too proud
Love, love, love, loss
Found love, too proud

[Hook]
Time to kill the lights
Erase the line
To distance your soul from mine
Search for the divine to find your soul
The soul that encaptured mine
The soul that encaptured mine
The soul that encaptured mine

[Verse 2]
Doubts controls your mind
Dwell in your life
Deliver me your illusion

Called love, love loss
Found love, too proud
Called love, love loss
Found love, too proud

[Bridge]
But because I know
But because I know
What isn't real
My love for you
But because I know
But because I know
What isn't real
My love for you
But because I know
But because I know
What isn't real
My love for you
But because I know
But because I know
What isn't real
My love for you
But because I know
But because I know
What isn't real
My love for you
But because I know
But because I know
What isn't real
My love for you
But because I know
But because I know
What isn't real
My love for you
But because I know
But because I know
What isn't real
My love for you
But because I know
But because I know
What isn't real
My love for you
But because I know
But because I know
What isn't real
My love for you

[Outro]
Oh... oh, oh, oh
Oh... oh, oh, oh
Oh... oh, oh, oh
Oh...
