[Chorus: Mista Cain]
You might be cute but you regular

You might be cute but you regular
Bitch eat my dick like an edible
My line be bumpin', I'm tellin' you

Gucci on my collar but my Air Mags regular

[Verse 2: WNC Whop Bezzy]
Bitch you regular, I can't even put you on my schedule
Your dude try me then I'm sending shots like I'm a messanger
And I don't do no phones, bitch I ain't textin' you
And bitch I ain't the lord so I ain't blessin' you
And yeah I hit your bitch so why you question her?
Pull up in the coupe, the top come off, this bitch a Teskla
Your bitch know I'm a G, that's why I'm F-ing her
You act like you can't hear me, what you deaf or some'?
What you tryna play me to the left or some'?
You think it's a game, what you a ref or some'?
Smokin' on that pressure, make my head hurt
Oh you on that regular, let me show you how that yay work
Giuseppes on my feet, check out the leg work
Stop askin' all them questions, give me head first
Don't make me drop a bag, nigga that's dead work

[Chorus: Mista Cain]
You might be cute but you regular
Bitch eat my dick like an edible
My line be bumpin', I'm tellin' you
I just sold a brick on the cellular
I'm rockin' the iced out perpetual
She tryna fit in my schedule
Bitch you being too technical
This time I might go federal
You might be cute but you regular
Bitch eat my dick like an edible
My line be bumpin', I'm tellin' you
I just sold a brick on the cellular
I'm rockin' the iced out perpetual
She tryna fit in my schedule
Bitch you being too technical
This time I might go federal
