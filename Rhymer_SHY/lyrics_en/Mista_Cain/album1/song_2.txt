[Chorus]
Creep up on him and no fair warning ain’t no rules and war
I’ve got standards I’ve got morals gets that money raise the bar
Niggas don’t want friendly bitches too much drama and that’s law
If you gon' take it there then take it there make sure you take it far
Creep up on 'em, creep up on 'em, creep up on 'em
Creep up on 'em, creep up on 'em, creep up on 'em
Creep up on 'em, creep up on 'em, creep up on 'em
Creep up on 'em, creep up on 'em, creep up on 'em
Creep up on 'em, creep up on 'em

[Verse 1]
I’ve been waiting around the corner at your mama's house in dark
If he don't bring that pressure to you comfort zone then he not raw
Half you niggas accidental murders an that's at fault
If you see who flush your dawg
Broad day them an that's law
An I'm raw
Don't have no flaw
Flush your lil dawg
It ain't my fault
You niggas smoking on regular
Hope you don't think that I'm scared of you
Bitch why you always want argue unhuh
Ext ext
Beef ain't never over with it's just calm down
The barrel on the carbon it get hot let it warm down
Money still flowing in nigga with the bank closed
Hit him up on Sycamore finish him on Plank Road

[Chorus]
Creep up on him and no fair warning ain’t no rules and war
I’ve got standards I’ve got morals gets that money raise the bar
Niggas don’t want friendly bitches too much drama and that’s law
If you gon' take it there then take it there make sure you take it far
Creep up on 'em, creep up on 'em, creep up on 'em
Creep up on 'em, creep up on 'em, creep up on 'em
Creep up on 'em, creep up on 'em, creep up on 'em
Creep up on 'em, creep up on 'em, creep up on 'em
Creep up on 'em, creep up on 'em

[Verse 2]
Get low, don’t let 'em see you coming cause they never look
Squeeze that bitch until the barrel burning or the metal cooked
Just brought a brand new fishing rod and a metal hook
They be diving in that water head first  don’t ever look
I know you you’ll probably rat on something
You already pussy
On my bid I had that mojo jumping ask big josh and mook
4 bales of that Grand daddy and some Cali Kush
If I catch another felony the judge gon throw the book
Bang Bang
No I'm not with no gang
Don’t need you on this mission with me
Cause you probably sang
Don’t like new niggas round me
'Cause they probably change
And you gon' die in midair if you touch this chain

[Chorus]
Creep up on him and no fair warning ain’t no rules and war
I’ve got standards I’ve got morals gets that money raise the bar
Niggas don’t want friendly bitches too much drama and that’s law
If you gon' take it there then take it there make sure you take it far
Creep up on 'em, creep up on 'em, creep up on 'em
Creep up on 'em, creep up on 'em, creep up on 'em
Creep up on 'em, creep up on 'em, creep up on 'em
Creep up on 'em, creep up on 'em, creep up on 'em
Creep up on 'em, creep up on 'em
