[Intro: Mista Cain]
Yeah, yeah, keep all that
From the three point line, LeBron

[Chorus: Mista Cain]
I'm chasin' bread but I'll squeeze on a nigga
The plug blessed the land, I can sneeze on the nigga
I just got a bale with no C's in the middle
And I like my bread with the cheese in the middle, yeah
I'm chasin' bread but I'll squeeze on a nigga
The plug blessed the land, I can sneeze on the nigga
I just got a bale with no C's in the middle
And I like my bread with the cheese in the middle, yeah

[Verse 1: Mista Cain]
What you know 'bout them P90's, with the clip in the front
I push that lil ho out my foreign, she left a stick in my blunt
I just bought another Audi, look like a ship in the front
Got the turbo in the dash with the shift in the front
Finna call her my lil Georgia ho and swipe for this
A brick of dog food, they might give me life for this
What you mean, fucking right, I got the right to trip
Cause I'm chillin and you steppin' on my Nike kicks
Just 'cause my hand on her ass don't mean I like the bitch
Yeah I been in the air catching flights and shit
You acting crazy, don't lose your life over hidin' a C-note
I got you rappers tucking your chain like you seen Debo

[Chorus: Mista Cain]
I'm chasin' bread but I'll squeeze on a nigga
The plug blessed the land, I can sneeze on the nigga
I just got a bale with no C's in the middle
And I like my bread with the cheese in the middle, yeah
I'm chasin' bread but I'll squeeze on a nigga
The plug blessed the land, I can sneeze on the nigga
I just got a bale with no C's in the middle
And I like my bread with the cheese in the middle, yeah

[Verse 2: Sherwood Marty]
Get out of line, you gotta go, I put that on my son
And every time I went to jail I quickly made bond
And now they tryna sentence me, I'm going on the run
Why would I ever leave my house without my fucking gun?
The plug blessed me when he came, dropped off a couple P's
Gave me a price and then he came knocked off a couple G's
My youngins sick, pulled on they block you know I had to sneeze
Know they gon' knock your ass off if you fuck with me
I sell the whole with no scale, like Scooter nigga I got them bales
It used to come through the mail, until they got on my trail
I'm in an auto with Trel, nigga ain't taking no L's
If I feel like you gon' tell, then I gotta send you to hell
It's over me, no coming down, I promise I'ma show you
Trap house going stupid, it ain't never closing
I heard the feds taking pictures so you know I'm posing
We quick to wet a nigga block up like some fucking lotion

[Chorus: Mista Cain]
I'm chasin' bread but I'll squeeze on a nigga
The plug blessed the land, I can sneeze on the nigga
I just got a bale with no C's in the middle
And I like my bread with the cheese in the middle, yeah
I'm chasin' bread but I'll squeeze on a nigga
The plug blessed the land, I can sneeze on the nigga
I just got a bale with no C's in the middle
And I like my bread with the cheese in the middle, yeah
