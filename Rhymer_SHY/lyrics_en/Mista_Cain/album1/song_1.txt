[Intro: Mista Cain]
Yeah
Yeah
Cain, Cain

[Chorus: Mista Cain & Jay Lewis]
I just made a bag and I went bought some ice again
My lil side bitch, she be trippin', she just want that pipe again
Left the pistol on the dresser so I brought that rifle in
Got my left foot in the door, I'm tryna get my right one in
Why you cuffin' that lil dusty bitch? go'n wife her then
'Cause if I catch her in my section she gon' get that pipe again
And if you play and hit a lead, they gon' try to give me life again
My lil scanner, she be scammin', can't wait 'til she swipe again

[Verse 1: Mista Cain]
Depend on how I'm feelin', I might fuck your girl again
Dirty on that Henny, think he 'bout to hurl again
If you won't do no pussy shit, why you actin' nervous then?
Bet a stack on Jay Lewis, bet he whoop on Earl again
I was bein' cool 'cause I still had open charges
Turned this bitch back up and they like who done got him started?
I got a bag for your head but I get stupid with that forty
If you raise that red flag, fuck around, become a moving target
Talkin' cash shit, and my pockets sit on Norbit
Fuck my last bitch, that ho turned a nigga heartless
She out here catchin' feelings for niggas and I was catchin' charges
My closet look like gyms, I just bought a TEC from Harvey

[Chorus: Mista Cain & Jay Lewis]
I just made a bag and I went bought some ice again
My lil side bitch, she be trippin', she just want that pipe again
Left the pistol on the dresser so I brought that rifle in
Got my left foot in the door, I'm tryna get my right one in
Why you cuffin' that lil dusty bitch? go'n wife her then
'Cause if I catch her in my section she gon' get that pipe again
And if you play and hit a lead, they gon' try to give me life again
My lil scanner, she be scammin', can't wait 'til she swipe again

[Verse 2: Jay Lewis]
I just got a sack of doja, know I blew that in the wind
My bitch trippin', blowin' up my phone, I fucked that girl again
Bitch two-forty, that's an eighty, but the bitch hold thirty-two
I'm 22, I got a cougar and that bitch, she 42
She buy all my J's, all I ever do is give her dick
If I want her, I'ma get her, hold up, let me shoot my stick
I'm a young money menace, I get all the dough, get all the bread
Real selective 'bout my bitches, all they do is give me ehad
I used to fuck on that lil ho but now I'm fuckin' with her sister
We been stickin' and movin' since they done freed that nigga Mista
Niggas beefin' over pussy, can't relate, my money straight
You out here speakin' on the nigga, you a bitch, that's out the gate, yeah

[Chorus: Mista Cain & Jay Lewis]
I just made a bag and I went bought some ice again
My lil side bitch, she be trippin', she just want that pipe again
Left the pistol on the dresser so I brought that rifle in
Got my left foot in the door, I'm tryna get my right one in
Why you cuffin' that lil dusty bitch? go'n wife her then
'Cause if I catch her in my section she gon' get that pipe again
And if you play and hit a lead, they gon' try to give me life again
My lil scanner, she be scammin', can't wait 'til she swipe again
