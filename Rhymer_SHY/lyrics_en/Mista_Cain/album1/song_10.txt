[Intro: Mista Cain]
My rich home boy woke me up and said nigga I hope you having a millionaire dream

[Hook: Mista Cain]
Dangerous, major risk
Falling off, flagrant
Louis Vuitton shades
Got a nigga seeing different, yeah
I don’t put my trust in anything, yeah
I don’t put my trust in anything
Dangerous, major risk
Falling off, flagrant
Louis Vuitton shades
Got a nigga seeing different, yeah
I don’t put my trust in anything, yeah
Make it be another homicide

[Verse 1: Mista Cain]
Public record, PSI
Me and lil one laying in my king, watching CSI
Shawty know she laying with a king so she treat me right
Home boy trippin’, it can be another homicide
Really I want peace and quiet
Foreign eat the asphalt, soon I might need new tires
In another whip ‘cause if I see shit I’ma open fire
Daddy always told me watch my 12, keep an open eye
Youngin’ watch for twelve while I’m standing over open pot
Hollow head leave you close mind like an open lock
White linen like a clothesline up in open lot
Pull up in another nigga’s hood and I open shots
Beaver thoughts playing through my mind, I just hope it stop
Make it be another homicide
Make it be another homicide
Make it be another homicide
Make it be another homicide

[Verse 2: Trouble]
I can’t trust none’, bitch know I’m gon’ touch some’
Know your ho gon’ fuck some’ if I come through in that push button
Homicide my young nigga, ‘bout that boy there I’ll bust some’
What happened to the real niggas Cain? They drinking ho punch
Talking worse than hoes, building cases, runnin’ they fuckin’ mouth
You don’t know what you talkin’ ‘bout, boy get your bitch ass in the house
I’m just tryna make it out this shit, you steady hating like a bitch
Won’t let ‘em take me from my family, or my paper, bitch get hit

[Hook: Mista Cain]
Dangerous, major risk
Falling off, flagrant
Louis Vuitton shades
Got a nigga seeing different, yeah
I don’t put my trust in anything, yeah
I don’t put my trust in anything
Dangerous, major risk
Falling off, flagrant
Louis Vuitton shades
Got a nigga seeing different, yeah
I don’t put my trust in anything, yeah
Make it be another homicide
