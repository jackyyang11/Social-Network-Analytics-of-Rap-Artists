[Chorus: Jay Lewis]
I done lost some niggas to the streets
I done lost some niggas to the beef
Yesterday they hit my cousin with that heat
Got so much love for the streets
Swear I got that love for the streets
But the streets don't seem to love me
I lost some niggas to the streets
I done lost some niggas to the beef
Yesterday they hit my cousin with that heat
Got so much love for the streets
Swear I got that love for the streets
But the streets don't seem to love me

[Verse 1: Mista Cain]
I done sold a lot of drugs in the streets
I just left out Cali, I got bud for the cheap
Plus I'm out to murder, catch a slug if we beef
I just beat a baddie, I got blood in the streets
Ain't no love in these streets
Death around the corner, beef with me like sleepin' with pneumonia
I don't think you want to run down on me, I'm gon' put it on you
Walk down on you, it don't matter if you standin' with your mama
And them niggas that you think gon' ride, they don't want no problems

[Chorus: Jay Lewis]
I done lost some niggas to the streets
I done lost some niggas to the beef
Yesterday they hit my cousin with that heat
Got so much love for the streets
Swear I got that love for the streets
But the streets don't seem to love me
I lost some niggas to the streets
I done lost some niggas to the beef
Yesterday they hit my cousin with that heat
Got so much love for the streets
Swear I got that love for the streets
But the streets don't seem to love me

[Verse 2: Bambino Gold]
I got bitches on my dick, feds on my nuts
Locked up my lil bro quick, we was fuckin' shit up
Ten thousand dollars for the rent for me to fuck hoes in
Another five for big shit I can kick dope in
I sweeped it up, how did my last spot got broke in?
Looked at my camera on my phone and peeped it was a fake friend
Took thirty shots at me, should've came with a hundred
Now his niggas in caskets 'cause they ain't one hundred

[Chorus: Jay Lewis]
I done lost some niggas to the streets
I done lost some niggas to the beef
Yesterday they hit my cousin with that heat
Got so much love for the streets
Swear I got that love for the streets
But the streets don't seem to love me
I lost some niggas to the streets
I done lost some niggas to the beef
Yesterday they hit my cousin with that heat
Got so much love for the streets
Swear I got that love for the streets
But the streets don't seem to love me
