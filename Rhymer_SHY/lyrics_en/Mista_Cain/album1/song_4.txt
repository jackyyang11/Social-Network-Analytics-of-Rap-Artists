[Verse 1: Mista Cain]
Pick up my Glock and my ball cap I'm focused now
Headin' down the straight road
My "La Familia" love me so they move when I say so
Never had no understanding, whatever I say go
Momma say I don't listen, sister say I be trippin
Positive way of livin', my name in a murder
Bust a nine in the broad day, beef 'bout what a broad say
Yea, and I missed one, I hit two, but I missed one
And I ain't ever had no dreams and goals
All I wanted was the green and gold
I'm talkin' hoes money weed and clothes
Keep your money bitch I need my soul
I breedRespect and breathe the code, that's what I live by

[Hook: Mista Cain]
My mom tried to do better I tried
Told my girl I was gonna leave them hoes alone, I lied
Said I was gonna leave them streets alone too, I lied
So much anger inside but I realize only the strong survive (x2)

[Verse 2: Mista Cain]
I be a motherfuckin' fool to let a bitch take me out
Me being pussy like P still think he 'bout it
You gone see me in the coffin
Put your hands up
My lil youngin' ain't got no mind he'll put your ass up
Come on, "man sup?" and come try me
This brand new rifle gonna have to catch its first body
Nigga made a statement about me talking about killing (check this out)
Well let me make a statement about your faggot ass nigga
Two four and a half two nines, fourteen quarters
A thousand grams south nigga I done placed that order
I'm thugging for real for years its been a scheme
How you gonna keep it real trying to sell a nigga dreams?

[Hook: Mista Cain]
My mom tried to do better I tried
Told my girl I was gonna leave them hoes alone, I lied
Said I was gonna leave them streets alone too, I lied
So much anger inside but I realize only the strong survive (x2)

[Verse 3: Mista Cain]
If ho'in was a crime then I know a few lifers
You a punk under pressure, go shower with pipers
The murder rate fucked up, it's tall as the Eiffel
I got beef I ain't cop out I went and bought me a rifle (two 23s)
Them hoes coming them hoes go it's a revolving cycle
And I just let her hit my head plus she was on her cycle
You can start using your legs if I got to fight you
I throw them bitches, make me turn Tyson and bite you
Clutched out, rear viewing when I'm in my ride
Burner in my lap son on my passenger side
See a nigga tryna get at me I don't have to decide
I'm just gonna up with that big bitch and get to open firing'

[Hook: Mista Cain]
My mom tried to do better I tried

Said I was gonna leave them streets alone too, I lied
So much anger inside but I realize only the strong survive (x2)
