(Hook: Chrizz Micheals)

Making love,(making love)
The feeling that I get when she don’t get enough(don't get enough)
And we sexing till the morning she don’t get enough
And I try to wake her up but she ain’t waking up

So time for making love
Repeat chorus

(Verse 1 Mista Cain)
From the floor to the dresser
I came up under that pressure
And fo we finish she up under the dresser
Murder…now I gotta bury this weapon
And I’m a menace just like dennis
Im a terrible fella
She grab me and she told me
She can’t get enough of me
And then that’s when she told me
She got major love for me
She told me not to ever worry bout her judging me
And if this was a trial she’d lie to the judge for me
Her fantasy for us to fuck on top of rose petals
This hennessy I been sippin on is so special
If she think that im not thuggin she  should know better
She ask me do I love her
I say let her soul tell her

(Hook: Chrizz Micheals)

Making love,(making love)
The feeling that I get when she don’t get enough(don't get enough)
And we sexing till the morning she don’t get enough
And I try to wake her up but she ain’t waking up

So time for making love
Repeat chorus

(verse 2 Mista Cain)
Victoria private, euphoria rising
Before she can roll she need a driver
Purple from Cali all I need is a lighter
Its needless to wife her i'm not eager to pipe her
So wet up inside her i'm lost in her tightness
So much of a bad boy she be calling me michael
Said it come from the shoulder when I give her that feeling
She say I sent her in a trance that she never experience
Well I speak from experience my sexing is serious
Don’t expect low expectations my limit is endless
Whenever we finish
Whenever we finish
I just wanna know
Cain
