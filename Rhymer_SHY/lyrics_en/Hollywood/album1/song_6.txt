[Verse 1: Funny Man & J-Dog]
They call it a scene, I call it disaster
Down here the kids grew up faster
Scared, they're scared to the bone
Pack of wolves, they don't run alone
One on one, they won't look you in the eye
But when the pack's together, there's a battle cry
Yeah, I saw it, fifteen on one
When the crowd dispersed, that kid was done

[Chorus: Charlie Scene & Johnny 3 Tears & Funny Man & J-Dog]
No!
No more
No!
Bad town
No more bad town
No!
No more
No!
Bad town
No more bad town

[Verse 2: Charlie Scene & Johnny 3 Tears]
Down there, gotta have a label
Just like some cattle in a stable
Knee-jerk reaction? I call it violence
Why speak out when you could be silenced?
Down there, out on the dance floor
Too much violence, I don't want more
Down there, out on the street
I can see the air, I can see the heat!

[Chorus: Charlie Scene & Johnny 3 Tears & Funny Man & J-Dog]
No!
No more
No!
Bad town
No more bad town
No!
No more
No!
Bad town
No more bad town
No!
No more
No!
Bad town
No more bad town
No!
No more
No!
Bad town
No more bad town

[Bridge: Charlie Scene]
No more, no more bad town
No more, no more bad town

[Chorus: Charlie Scene & Johnny 3 Tears & Funny Man & J-Dog]
No!
No more
No!
Bad town
No more bad town
No!
No more
No!
Bad town
No more bad town
