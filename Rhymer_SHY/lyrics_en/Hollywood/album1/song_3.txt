[Chorus: Funny Man & Danny]
These voices won't let you leave
These voices won't let you leave
These voices won't let you leave
These voices won't let you leave
I wish there was another way out!

[Verse 1: Charlie Scene]
Voices won't go away
They say some awful things
I don't think no one's home
I better find you first
I better find you first

[Chorus: Funny Man & Danny]
These voices won't let you leave
These voices won't let you leave
These voices won't let you leave
These voices won't let you leave
I wish there was another way out!

[Verse 2: Funny Man]
You gave up? I'll check and see
Rest in peace
Dead wrong I guess you'll be
What should my next weapon be?
It's over you can't breathe

[Chorus: Danny & Funny Man]
I wish there was another way out
These voices won't let you leave
These voices won't let you leave
These voices won't let you leave
These voices won't let you leave
I wish there was another way out!
I wish there was another way out
I wish there was another way out
