[Chorus: Danny]
We don't apologize, and that's just the way it is
But we can harmonize even if we sound like shit
Don't try to criticize, you bitches better plead the fifth
We've been idolized, role models for all the kids

[Verse 1: J-Dog]
You heard us before, but that was just a little sample
We're back for more, here to set the worst example
Chop it up, white stuff, let's begin
Big wolves lining up and snorting little pigs
Still drunk and we're doing it again
With a huff and a puff, I'll blow and burn down your shit
Murdered out, pitch black grin, still white skin
You know I'm hard to kill, for real I'm moving in
I'm putting twenty-two down while I'm puking up blood
You know I'm here to stay or, fuck, I'm gonna die young
Now my posse's getting big and my posse's getting bigger
It's one eighty-eight minus one, you know the figure

[Chorus: Danny]
We don't apologize, and that's just the way it is
But we can harmonize even if we sound like shit
Don't try to criticize, you bitches better plead the fifth
We've been idolized role models for all the kids

[Verse 2: Charlie Scene]
It's easy to be drunk when it's hard to be sober
I'mma steal your leased Rover and pull police over
I'm a mean smoker who reeks of weed odor
Certified street soldier, devil on your teen's shoulder
Don't invite Scene over, he pees at sleepovers
He asks your sister out just so he can cheat on her
What a creep loner, shit, I couldn't sink lower
You just got a mean boner from a Charlie Scene poster
If I'm popping a wheelie, it's 'cause I'm jacking your bike
Got my middle finger raised as I'm running red lights
I'm known to punch 'em in the dick at the end of a fight
And I'll never say I'm sorry at the end of the night

[Chorus: Danny]
We don't apologize, and that's just the way it is
But we can harmonize even if we sound like shit
Don't try to criticize, you bitches better plead the fifth
We've been idolized, role models for all the kids

[Verse 3: Johnny 3 Tears]
So many dollars stuffed in my wallet
Chain so bling, yeah, you know that I'm a baller
We can take the blame 'cause your parents don't wanna
They roll their blunts with your marijuana
How can I run when the pigs got a chopper?
I got a gun, but they got a lotta
Shooting at the sky with a motherfucking sawed-off
God bless a Catholic, forgive me Father
Now, what's a man to do when another holds a Bible?
Vatican suing me, holding me liable
Confessions of a kid and they call 'em suicidal
Temptations of a sinner but we call him a child
How can you blame 'em? A playground of dealing
The mother's still buying, the father's still preaching
Now it's up to me 'cause no one's gonna teach 'em
Now nobody, nobody needs 'em

[Chorus: Danny]
We don't apologize, and that's just the way it is
But we can harmonize even if we sound like shit
Don't try to criticize, you bitches better plead the fifth
We've been idolized, role models for all the kids
