[Verse 1: Funny Man]
I'm losing my mind today, yo, what the fuck can I say?
I got these drugs on the way, c-couple hits then I sway
You better get out the way before I spray that AK
Yo, what the fuck can I say? I'm losing my mind today
Dipped up in that mosh pit, elbows up, let's bust some lips
Acting like I give a shit, roll it up, take a hit
Smelling like that Mary J, hands on that champagne, champagne
Maintain a bad habit like the cocaine
I'm on another level, a level you can't pass
I'm on some other shit, who knows how long it'll last?
My heart is beating out, this shit just creeps up fast
I'm on another level, a level you can't pass

[Chorus: Funny Man, Charlie Scene & Danny]
I'm on another level, I'm on another level, I'm on another level
Li'l bitch
I'm on another level, I'm on another level, I'm on another level
Shit
I'm on another level, I'm on another level, I'm on another level
I'm on another level, I'm on another level, I'm on another level

[Verse 2: Johnny 3 Tears]
I got a modern persona made of cocaine marijuana
Fuck you bitch-ass primadonnas, gonna b-b-break you down
I got a whole lot of vengeance deep inside of every sentence
Yeah, I'm just another menace sent to b-b-break you down
And I feel it now, break it down, every time I bleed 'em out
Sixty, six, six, suffocating every count
And I should run, but I don't, let me tell you why I won't
When the devil takes your hand, let me show you what he wrote (Woo!)
I'm so fucking dope
And I'm cleaner than the bottom of a sack of coke
And these motherfuckers talk, but they always choke
Like they're hanging at the bottom of a six-foot rope
Can't stop now, nope, gotta keep going
You can sober up, I'm gonna keep on blowing
Gonna tear it up, gonna burn it down
Then drop that fucking beat now

[Chorus: Funny Man, Charlie Scene & Danny]
I'm on another level, I'm on another level, I'm on another level
Li'l bitch
I'm on another level, I'm on another level, I'm on another level
Shit
I'm on another level, I'm on another level, I'm on another level
I'm on another level, I'm on another level, I'm on another level

[Verse 3: J-Dog]
Here I sit, Sunset and Vine
With an empty bottle and a drinking fine
No woe is me 'cause I ain't got time
Too cold to feel, and I'mma take what's mine
So fuck this club, I'mma rush the line
Gonna get kicked out, gonna rack some wine
And at 5 AM, I'mma make the climb
I'mma take a piss off the Hollywood sign

[Chorus: Funny Man, Charlie Scene & Danny]
I'm on another level, I'm on another level, I'm on another level
Hahaha
I'm on another level, I'm on another level, I'm on another level
Shit
I'm on another level, I'm on another level, I'm on another level
I'm on another level, I'm on another level, I'm on another level
