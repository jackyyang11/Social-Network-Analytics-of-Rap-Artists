Me, myself, I like poppin tabs
Budd Light chase away Jim and Jack
Suits on, I'm where party's at, we deep in the woods so come on back
We hell raisers, do you like that
Oh, matter of fact, I'm throwin cash
Oh, pardon me, I just have to ask
What you know bout a country boy with swag

Oh, could it be?
Yeah, Lenny C, the mud digger king straight out of NC
I'm laid back, haters fade back
Been down to the dumps but I'm back on track with a record deal and my country rap and a 'hot damn' and an 'oh, snap'. I love the country, you don't have to ask
And I love Jack Daniels in my flask
I love my huntin, and I love my fishin, and I damn sure love my country women
So pardon me, darling, I just have to ask. What you know bout a country boy with swag

Hell yes, when I haul my truck, you think you got somethin
Come try your luck
It's got diesel and it's damn sure tough, but it ain't a Ford, this truck's more buff
Like a rocket, can't be topped, Chevrolet, all the way
A real man's truck's all I gotta say and the way I do it is the southern way
Call the shop, what I gotta have, I'm thinkin' of gettin' some smoke stacks
And throw the cash in money bags, cause that's how a country boy does it with swag

What do you know about a country boy with some swag
S-W-A-G, country swag, yeah that's me
Pumpin everywhere, you know what I mean
Everything moss, see oak, a real tree
Camo'd out, so I'm hard to see
You probably think I'm crazy, a little, yeah, just maybe
I'm too hot, you can't tame me
