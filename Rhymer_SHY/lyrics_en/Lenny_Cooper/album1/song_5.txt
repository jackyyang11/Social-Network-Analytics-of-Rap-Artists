Big tires, big tires
I got some big tires, 54's coming down the road
Got the hammer down hear my truck roar
Tires so loud, people saying good lord
You can hear me from miles away
In a mud hole's where I stay
Come and play but some things are required
You gotta have a big truck and some big tires

Lookout it's the monster truck
Revin' up, they get the crowd pumped
These big tires getting caked up
Holding off the line making deep ruts
We take it serious, this ain't a game
These trucks gone wild man it's insane
Stack through the hood, blowing flames
Slinging rooster tails as high as air planes
We getting loose, we're a crazy gang
Trucks lined up like a crazy train
This is what we do there ain't no stopping us
Driving over cars in out big trucks
It's now or never just sky's the limit
Jack them up is how we living
If you don't feel it then you wanna ask why just something about a big truck and big tires

Big tires, big tires
I got some big tires
54's coming down the road got my hammer down hear my truck roar
Tires so loud, people saying good lord
You can hear me from miles away
In a mud hole's where I stay
Come and play but some things are required
You gotta have a big truck and some big tires

Call up, Rocky Ridge, tell him I need me a monster lift
For my super swampers ya they boggers
Tearing up the woods just like a logger
I'm climbing rocks, straight up to the top
I'll make you so scared ya jump out your socks
I'm always ready, it's balls to the wall
Sometimes there's slips and close calls
But it's fun and that's what it's all about
Mud bogs and wallering out
Riding down the dirt roads to find the spot
Switching gears and being fully locked
It is what it is and what I desire
My Chevrolet can do a all nighter
Yeah, it's big truck, damn right
With what? You know, big tires

Big tires, big tires
I got some big tires, 54's coming down the road
? hear my truck roar
Tires so loud, people saying good lord
You can hear me from miles away
In a mud hole's where I stay
Come and play but some things are required
You gotta have a big truck and some big tires

Big tires coming down the road
I'm on the way to truck show
Now I'm on the scene and all eyes on me
Big tires on the truck that's the real clean
I'm big time country stunting, yeah I'm bumping, let me tell you something
This pretty ass blonde, walks on up and says
Excuse me but can I ride in your truck
I said hell yeah girl, climb on up
Now it's time to ride, it's party time
We riding high, it's southern pride
A great time to shine and you to be mine
With white tees with mud stains, raise in hell
Doing are thing, So drop your chain and hook it on up
To my big truck, with big tires

Big tires, big tires
I got some big tires, 54's coming down the road
? hear my truck roar
Tires so loud, people saying good lord
You can hear me from miles away
In a mud hole's where I stay
Come and play but some things are required
You gotta have a big truck and some big tires
