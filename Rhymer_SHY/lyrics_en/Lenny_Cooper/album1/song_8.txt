[Chorus]
Chasing them dreams, makin them hits
From an old back road to down in the sticks
Work hard for a dollar, with no regrets
That’s just who i am, yeah the fam' been blessed
Chillin’ in the backwoods
Livin’ life how I should
And you know it’s all good
Chillin’, chillin’ in the backwoods

[Verse 1]
I had the intentions and visions of me makin’ a million
Relax, kick back no worries or two shits is given
But I was wrong
This here is hard work
Torn shirt, back hurt, blisters ’bout to burst
I keep moving forward
With life that has no rebirth, no reverse
Mo script, no stage, not a damn thing that was rehearsed
Late nights, bar fights, and early morning headaches
Advil, orange juice, and complementary pancakes
On an old back road where I be making my hits
Knockin’ all these wannabe CMTs up off the list
Dirty dirty ya heard me, from Cali to Jersey
Stay thirsty, prove I'm worthy, stack them pay

Chorus:
Chasing them dreams, makin' them hits
From an old back road to down in the sticks
Work hard for a dollar, with no regrets
That’s just who I am, yeah the fam' been blessed
Chillin’ in the backwoods
Livin’ life how I should
And you know it’s all good
Chillin’, chillin’ in the backwoods

[Verse 2]
I’ve been around for quite some time
Business man, i am the mind
Chasing dreams, everything i got
You damn right i put it on the line
Failure ain’t an option, put it all on the table
It’s me, my wife, my kids and our future slooking stable
Blessed, yeah i grateful for this label
Know im able put some butter on this bagel
Even sit back, watch some cable
Need a change up in this game
So I came and added flavor
They be hatin’ cause im greater
I wave bye bye to them haters
Up early in the morning, to late in the evening
Been grinding till I'm bleeding
While you other steadty sleeping
Reaping what you sold, I'm bearing the load, lets’ roll
Country music inspires the soul

Chorus:
Chasing them dreams, makin' them hits
From an old back road to down in the sticks
Work hard for a dollar, with no regrets
That’s just who I am, yeah the fam' been blessed
Chillin’ in the backwoods
Livin’ life how I should
And you know it’s all good
Chillin’, chillin’ in the backwoods

[Bridge]
Dirtified, in the sticks
I'm a backwoods baller
Work hard for my dollar
Poppin’ them camo collars
I'm callin the shots, lock, cock
Put a bullseye on the top ain’t gonna stop
Nahh

Chorus:
Chasing them dreams, makin' them hits
From an old back road to down in the sticks
Work hard for a dollar, with no regrets
That’s just who I am, yeah the fam' been blessed
Chillin’ in the backwoods
Livin’ life how I should
And you know it’s all good
Chillin’, chillin’ in the backwoods
