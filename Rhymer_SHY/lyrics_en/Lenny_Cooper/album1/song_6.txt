[Verse 1]
Howdy y’all, yeah I’m back again
Lenny Cooper and them rowdy friends
Here to get down, go buckwild, let loose
Small town, Saturday night, yeah we raise the roof
Then my buddy just called, said “I got the wood, let’s go,”
“Call Big D, bring the stereo. And let everybody know
We in the 6 just follow the red glow.”

[Verse 2]
City slicks be askin’ questions like
What we doin’ and which direction
It’s the next time they can be accepted
This the backwoods, just be yourself kid
No rules, just lettin’ loose
This ain’t a book of the who’s-who’s
Then they ask “where can I find ya?”
That’s when I said

[Chorus]
We be back in the field with those 8-0-8’s bumpin’
All my rowdy friends are comin’
We gonna- gonna get down, gonna get down
That’s just how we do, gonna get a little wired tonight
And raise some hell down at the bonfire

[Verse 3]
Oh, please excuse my demeanor I’m just goin’ off that clear
I might look, oh wait, homie hold my beer
Cause I’m gettin’ torn up from the floor up
And that bonfire burnin’ hot
And there ain’t nothin’ but beer, bass, and booty runnin’ through my mind
It’s the same way every time
(Time to get down)

[Verse 4]
Take a second, switch gears
Lenny Cooper over here, got the yeetis over there, women everywhere
And you already know when your boy Dustin Rhodes hits the spot
Bet you ass can't shine there
I jack it up, don’t give a what
Im’ma gas it, so buddy hold my funnel
Tell the DJ to turn it up
I’m ‘bout to hit a new dance called the Drunky Shuffle

[Chorus]
We be back in the field with those 8-0-8’s bumpin’
All my rowdy friends are comin’
We gonna- gonna get down, gonna get down
That’s just how we do, gonna get a little wired tonight
And raise some hell down at the bonfire

[Chorus]
We be back in the field with those 8-0-8’s bumpin’
All my rowdy friends are comin’
We gonna- gonna get down, gonna get down
That’s just how we do, gonna get a little wired tonight
And raise some hell down at the bonfire
