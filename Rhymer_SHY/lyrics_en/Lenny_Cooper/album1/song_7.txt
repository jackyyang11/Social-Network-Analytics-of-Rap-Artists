[Chorus]
If I’m gonna do it, I’m gonna do it big
Raise a little hell yeah that’s the way we live
Feeling, feeling good, country boy style
Only live once, so we do it buck wild
Buckwild, buckwild what
And we stay buckwild, buckwild what
And we stay buckwild, buckwild what
And we stay buckwild, buckwild, buckwild, buckwild, buck wild

[Verse 1]
I got this whole thing jumpin’ ain’t it something, mention my name
Brings rowdy folks out from the country, women dress insane
With them short shorts holding tall boys, take a smoke right to the brain
Ladies love them country boys, some things just ain’t gonna change
Belly button for shot glasses that ain’t filled with that store bought
Made fresh down by the river ’bout a hundred yards from my huntin’ spot
And that’s how we like it
And that’s how we live it
And I’ve been doing the stuff for years, yeah it’s family tradition
They get low to Carolina flow this speaker about to blow
So who brought the party? Well they better bring some more
Good Lordy Lordy, everybody get lit. Shadows long from the fire, time to take another sip

[Chorus]
If I’m gonna do it, I’m gonna do it big
Raise a little hell yeah that’s the way we live
Feeling, feeling good, country boy style
Only live once, so we do it buck wild
Buckwild, buckwild what
And we stay buckwild, buckwild what
And we stay buckwild, buckwild what
And we stay buckwild, buckwild, buckwild, buckwild, buck wild

[Verse 2]
If I’m in it you can bet that I ain’t in it to lose
Pedal to the floorboard ’till I’m running on fumes
Then throw a little prime shine in the tank and get back to the groove
So call me the wild child ’cause I was born a hell raisin’ dude
But big is all I know, that’s how I roll
So don’t get stuck
Y’all I’m buying thirty packs, hell I’m buying the beer truck
Party harder than a redneck at mardigras with the beads
Havin’ fun that’s all that’s on my agenda to achieve
With a big block in my truck, big tires for the digging’
You think you can top me, nah dog you must be tripping’
Let me paint a vision, about this country livin’
Moonshine, some cold beer, and a lot of sexy women

[Chorus]
If I’m gonna do it, I’m gonna do it big
Raise a little hell yeah that’s the way we live
Feeling, feeling good, country boy style
Only live once, so we do it buck wild
Buckwild, buckwild what
And we stay buckwild, buckwild what
And we stay buckwild, buckwild what
And we stay buckwild, buckwild, buckwild, buckwild, buck wild
