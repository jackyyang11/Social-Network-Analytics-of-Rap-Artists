If Ima ride high
Never ever ride low
Drive it real fast never ever drive slow
Keep it jacks up gotta spend lots of dough
Four dollar diesel, yup make the truck go
And if we ride it, start it, jack it up
Loud pipes yea we stack it up
Limo tint how we backin' up
We drive right through where your backin up
54's on camo painted
Flag flyin, mine faded
Laughing at them city folks, 'cause assault is overrated
Speed limit 65, I don't care I'm flyin by
Pulled up real high
Stepped out the door suicide
V neck drake branded
Ob rig shades on
If you can't stand it, then go ahead and just hate on

If I'm gonna ride, Ima Ima ride 54
If I'm gonna ride, Ima Ima ride 54
If I'm gonna ride, Ima Ima ride 54, 54, fif-fifty- fifty-four
If I'm gonna ride, Ima Ima ride 54
If I'm gonna ride, Ima Ima ride 54
If I'm gonna ride, Ima Ima ride 54, 54, fif-fifty-fifty-four
Base steady bumpin', 808 thumpin'
Police really hate, but damn the girls love it
Crome stack Rollin, tire treads smokin
Redneck rich buy another of its broken
We be ridin with them high rollers
Obstacles trees and boulders
12.4 hundred yards hangin out the window unloaded
Drive best to get lost, AC Blowin permafrost
Can't fit through the drive through
That thunder storms my car wash
1000 watts, speakers bump
Drivin over the trees n stuff
What you call a smart car, I call a speed bump
So much rubber on my truck, call it the Trojan man
Get all deep up in the hole
Then bust out like a slow jam
If I'm gunna ride, Ima Ima ride 54
If I'm gunna ride, Ima Ima ride 54
If I'm gunna ride, Ima Ima ride 54, 54, fif-fifty-fifty-four
If I'm gunna ride, Ima Ima ride 54
If I'm gunna ride, Ima Ima ride 54
If I'm gunna ride, Ima Ima ride 54, 54, fif-fifty-fifty-four
