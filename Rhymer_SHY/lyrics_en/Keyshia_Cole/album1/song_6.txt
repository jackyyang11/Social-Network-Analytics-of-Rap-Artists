[Verse 1]
I need somebody who’ll protect my feelings and my heart
Someone who never let no one come in between what we got
And there'll never be another woman to do what I do (for you)
And it's like that ‘cause you know that it would hurt me bad
If I found out you were untrue

[Pre-Chorus]
(It wouldn't be worth it for you)
To see me hurt or to see me down
(You would do what you had to do)
To see me smile again
I believed every word that you told me
But there'll be no talk ‘cause you would show me
It'll be a feeling I couldn't describe
You know why?

[Chorus]
‘Cause I would be your best friend
Be there late at night when you’re walking in
Be there in morning when
(Be there when you) open your eyes
I'll be by your side
I would be your best friend
Be there late at night when you’re walking in
Be there in the morning when
You open your eyes
I'll be by your side
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
I wanna be the one when you're down I pick you up
There'll never be no one who could ever doubt my love
And there'll never be another man
‘Cause you know all I need (is you)
And it's like that
‘Cause you know that I’mma hold you down no matter what

[Pre-Chorus]
It wouldn't be worth me losing you
I would do what I had to do
To see you smile again

[Chorus]
‘Cause I would be your best friend
Be there late at night when you’re walking in
Be there in morning when
(Be there when you) open your eyes
I'll be by your side
I would be your best friend
Be there late at night when you’re walking in
Be there in the morning when
You open your eyes
I'll be by your side
Yeah yeah

[Bridge]
And no matter what I won't be the reason you hurt, no no
And no matter what can you be the reason to love again
(I wanna try this once again)
Baby, can we try?
I don't need nobody else (no...)

[Chorus]
Best friend
Be there late at night when you walking in
Be there in morning when
(Be there when you) open your eyes
I'll be by your side
I would be your best friend
Be there late at night when you’re walking in
Be there in the morning when
You open your eyes
I'll be by your side
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Outro]
I'll be by your side, baby
I'll be by your side, baby
I'll be right beside you
I'll be there beside you
I don't need...
Um, nobody else baby, yeah…
