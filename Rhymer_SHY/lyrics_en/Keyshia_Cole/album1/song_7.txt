[Verse 1]
Never known nobody else
That knows me even more than I know myself
And I'm still trying to see what you see in me
And understand, the one I am
And you are the one who changed me with your love
You make me

[Chorus]
You make me wanna be a better me
You make me wanna get it right
And be the one who deserves to be the one always in your life
You make me wanna be the one you see
What's beautiful in your eyes
You make me, you make me wanna be a better me

[Verse 2]
You make me feel I'm 10 feet tall
You make me think I can do anything at all
And I'm here to make sure you find all you need in me
Because you give the love that lifts me up
I swear to you right now, I won't let you down
You make me

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You keep me strong, you keep me on track
What you give, I wanna give back
Thank God for you, thank God for you

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Make me wanna be a, make me
Make me wanna be a better me
You make me, make me wanna be a
You make me, make me wanna be a
You make me, make me wanna be a
You make me wanna be a better me
You make me wanna get it right
You make me wanna be a better me
You make me, you make me wanna be a better me
You make me wanna be a better me
You make me wanna get it right
