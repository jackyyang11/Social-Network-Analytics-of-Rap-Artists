It is what it is my nigga, yeah
More motherfucking verbal madness
More motherfucking beat downs
It is what it is my nigga, yeah
More motherfucking verbal madness
More motherfucking beat downs
More smashing yoru motherfucking head into the fucking wall
Oh no, let’s get it

[Verse 1: Oh No]
Everytime I spit it’s like a hammer spray
Each word is a bullet in the hand of ain't
Iffin the ammunition in the chamber gauge
I lay down anybody within the range
Same passenger seat up in my nigga’s range
Windows down and smelling like the illest strain
Can’t outsmoke the o’s it’s like a loaded train
I derail your tracks think y’all my name
Homie I’m a menace to the music
Old dog when he shootin, can’t nobody do shit
But I’d rather get my brain boosted
While I’m getting brain from this pretty young thang movin
Look that right there, I call it head start
Rising in the trucks, bizarre faces get your head start
With the old hood order, I’m red fox
Pushing big stones out the quarry like bedrock

The bars are we, the bars are we
The bars are we, the bars are we

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
I’ve been hit, hard away, surgical gloves, blood on my prada frames
Smoother than charde, operates, spit until the...
Come and see talk, what your dollar say
You only you balls at your mama’s place
I lay my head with a left fly and choppers chase
Getting bread, prize and cookies on top of cakes
Who conglomerate, honor me great
I know the job relate, darling your face
Eating pasta ...not today...time, my ...got the same
Monumental like diana has barely holiday
Part of day, beats from the east, release for honest pay
Why for beloving, never mind what the coppers say
Shop club on top of my game, you can spot em with the model thang
Whole team poppin the same, rep marvin gaye
Sharking they ways, these niggas...
Trademark, morphian flow, watch your body shake

The bars are we, the bars are we
The bars are we, the bars are we

[Verse 3: Esoteric]
Bodies everywhere, headstones and leg groins
I infested of off the club, I know you felt the love
Fuck you dead tune, I rock you like ...
Decapitate your worthly, so I stay ahead of schedule
We aplicant holmes, ...we pharaohs in thrones
I made deliver decease, we some rebels on mikes
I’m on the building and I’m snipin the haters
I’m tryina...cycle invader, as those spasms on that stupid ass
Spit you the computer crack
Have you breathing through a mask, like Bane or maybe Tuukka Rask
I am taking you to test, kill you let the funeral pass
I guarantee the coffin fit, like the cats through the grass
I ain’t jokin, tell your family the logan
It’s like 1000 flows I’m over and get buried through the map
