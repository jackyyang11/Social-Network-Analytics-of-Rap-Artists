Oh shit! She got to blowin, suckin, give up
I finally bust a nut and said "I DON'T GIVE A FUCK!"

[Tha Realest]
You know I heard you got some bomb ass pussy, so do this thug a favor

I try my best not to blink cos then I'm missin ass

Intoxicated the whole time while I'm up in your shit
So understand these rules before you play the fuckin game
Bitches are all the same, baby we ain't ashamed

[Kurupt]

Call me Big Poppa Rayfield, mashin the Cutlass, bitch rollin dirty
G'd up, rollin with an old 30-30, know why bitch?
