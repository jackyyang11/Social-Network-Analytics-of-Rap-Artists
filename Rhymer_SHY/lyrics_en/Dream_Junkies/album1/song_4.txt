If ever lost
If you're human
When you're fragile
Do they answer, decrease the weight of your fall?

[Verse 1: Ruslan]
It's like the world cast a spell on me
It's like the, stars misaligned and it
Fell on me
It's like we, only pouring out for the
Head homies
And taking for granted, the one's who ain't here
Ain't seein' clear only
A reflection in a mirror that's been broken
Guess I got 7 years of bad luck [?]
But I'm going through the window cause these walls keep closing in
A few remain there arms open wide for my closest friends
Born for adversary, closer than a brother is
Closer than my mother is, never stop loving this
Despite my own stubbornness, still ask the hard questions
Still putting up for who I am, no matter what the trouble is
I'm guessing I can be a little difficult to deal with
The realness of my personhood is really quick to spill this
Whatever's on my mind, with no filter I gotta hear this
The way I'm meant to say it from the evening to the a.m. like

[Verse 2: John Givez]
It's like I'm where I need to be
Ever present in the essence is the sweet relief in being loved
Forgive me for what I can't reciprocate
Learning to be available in my state of mind
State your claim if I ever disappointed you
Distanced myself or did deeds that haunted you
The honest truth is I, I've been on the edge for some time
I've been dealing with the limelight, trying to define
Right and wrong
So I guess this is a special song for my loved ones
You like my special echelon
I extra need you by my side, ride or die, fly or fry
Until we get desire on, then I cyanide
I am I, you gon' always be you
And in this vast village we gon' always be true
If you know I got then it then just tell me what you need
Yea, cause for you, you know I'll bleed
C'mon

[Verse 3: Beleaf]
Ayo I feel like you're my real ones
You're the only ones that push me further in my skill son
Started underground but now we busting through the ceiling
When the Junkies they step in the building
We giving the people the healing
We might not be making a killing
But we making them say hey (Hey)
We making them say oh (Oh)
Showing love to the people at every single show
Nothing lasts forever, everybody's got to go
So if this my last rhyme with y'all, y'all gotta know
Brother John, you're a leader and they gon' follow you
But you ain't tell 'em to, don't let them devour you
See rebels don't follow rules, keep fighting for solitude
Cause that is the place that God will hit you with audibles
And Ru, you've been my A1 since day 1
And it ain't no way son
That just because you be looking caucasian, there's no relation
I'm an orphan and I done found some family in y'all
This Good Religion, if I ever need you, Imma call
Wassup
