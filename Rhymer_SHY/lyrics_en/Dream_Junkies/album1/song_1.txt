Get on 'fore you smell my smoke
Get on 'fore you smell my smoke
Get on
You better get on 'fore you smell my smoke
Get on 'fore you smell my smoke
Get on 'fore you smell my smoke
Get on
You better get on 'fore you smell my smoke
Inhale
Exhale
You better get on
You better get on 'fore you smell my smoke
Inhale
Exhale
You better get on
You better get on 'fore you smell my smoke

[Verse 1: Beleaf]
Let's take a little time out
I'ma rhyme 'bout
Who this young man is before I sign out
Bedroom window you would climb out
Sis said [?] lemme find out
Lemme hear a little something next time we hang out
Man, you know what I'm about, I'ma take it way back
Fogging up the windows, my name is J-Stacks
O-Side till I die, check my lungs is black
I already knew that
Smelt it on your breath on the last shape up
It's 'round the same time you was feeling for a mustache
Hit your upper lip with a little makeup
For them streets you had loyalty
But God intended you for royalty
You said you'd never let the homies go
Watch I let the sun shine, Brother John let 'em grow (Uh)

[Hook: John Givez]
Get on 'fore you smell my smoke
Get on 'fore you smell my smoke
Get on
You better get on 'fore you smell my smoke
Get on 'fore you smell my smoke
Get on 'fore you smell my smoke
Get on
You better get on 'fore you smell my smoke

[Verse 2: Beleaf]
The little engine that could on the come up
Chugga, chugga, chugga up the hill with the sun up
Aye ese on the hood tryna run up
On him with the gun out
Our side know it ain't no fun out
Airport early in the morning took the flight out
Smoke in the air, almost looking like it's white-out
I wanna hide out, cause I can't breathe
But I'm riding shotgun and the shotgun smoke
Put a--- at ease, when I'm rolling with my lil' bro
At the shows all the fans like, where he go
Around the corner, tryna let off some steam
With a smile on his face as he blow the nicotine
In the air
Second-hand smoke, riding shotgun when I'm chilling with the GOAT
Don't mind me if I cough or I choke man
I'm here by your side, tell me where you wanna go

[Hook: John Givez]
Get on 'fore you smell my smoke
Get on 'fore you smell my smoke
Get on
You better get on 'fore you smell my smoke
Get on 'fore you smell my smoke
Get on 'fore you smell my smoke
Get on
You better get on 'fore you smell my smoke
Inhale
Exhale
You better get on
You better get on 'fore you smell my smoke
Inhale
Exhale
You better get on
You better get on 'fore you smell my smoke
