[Intro]
Uh, hello Mr. Melanin
This is Dr. Steve Maddix
I'm just calling to let you know all the tests were negative
And you are in perfect health
So there is really no good reason why this album is not out yet
So I expect it to be out as soon as possible
And a free copy
You can bring it when you come back in the office for your next checkup
Peace

[Verse 1: Ruslan]
I don't wanna hear no more trap beats
Feel like I'm racing with the groove like a track meet
Even though I've trained like an athlete
So you don't wanna catch a 90's fade like it's Blackstreet
Homie that's deep
Did Kendrick tell you Backstreet Boys to go ahead and take a backseat
Freestyle, meanwhile I continue lasting
I continue gaining weight even when I'm fasting
Wait, I don't know if that's something to brag about
Haters in the house, Dream Junkies went and ran 'em out
I ain't rich or famous but I can say that it's panning out
And I don't really care if Don Cannon got his cannon out
See I don't need a co-sign
Especially when the average consumer seems so blind
And what's the point of getting rich if then you have no time
I'm on my way to getting both, and life feels so fine
Oh my, God
We did it on His terms and did it on our clock
Did it the way we wanted while these other rappers watched
While they keep playing they Barts, I don't mean to sound harsh
But it seems like very few were really speaking from they're hearts

[Hook: Ruslan & John Givez]
When the debt seems stacked and the money feels low
And my corner saying yes but the crowd is yelling no
And they don't mean to offend me
I get it the odds are against me
When the debt seems stacked and the money feels low
And my corner saying yes but the crowd is yelling no
And they don't mean to offend me
I get it the odds are against me
But I don't need to explain myself
No, I don't need to explain myself
I don't need to explain myself
No, I don't need to explain myself to you

[Verse 2: Beleaf]
I desired the fan, this lyrical fire, the flame
The blaze the torch to 'em, wildfire uncontained
I'm more than human
I am restrained by the flesh, the blood, the bones, organs and veins
Still I refrain from using profane speech
And setting unrealistic goals I can't reach
There's a thorn in my flesh, it feels like a beast
And I would meet my death if only you would increase
Let me be the deceased, I fall into a grave
Into a pit, into a ditch, into a casket
I behave just like a slave, freedom seemed unsafe
But I rather felt the security than to need faith
And I'd rather be the minority then to make haste
I put beats to death and resurrect the great
Gallica in a fruit, bite wasn't more than a grape
Put a mallet to your mind, watch the lies dissipate
This a pace I embrace, peek-a-boo hide your face
Hide your kids, hide your wife
Watch your legacy erase
I put my family first
And punctuate the face of anybody offended with a freaking exclama-tion
Point taken, chewing on turkey bacon and avocado
I'm part of the beard gang bravado
What's worse, being full of it or just as hollow?
I'm elevating my mind but not higher like Colorado
Come on

[Hook: Beleaf and John Givez]

[Verse 3: John Givez]
And man I swear these boys were true poppers
Hanging and slanging on the corner dressed in blue
Johnny law got involved, I was only just a youth
And then it hit me, I gotta find a better way to move
Met up with some dudes named Beleaf the other Ru
Brang me around the church and introduced me to the crew
Fell in love with the Lord, He told me I was something new
And then I knew immediately what I was supposed to do
Now I'm standing on stages
Tryna encourage all of my brothers that's trapped in mazes
The truth really I'm amazed at the way that the fable lays on my shoulder
And when I hit the pearly gates I'm gonna praise Him for opening up the doors
See the story may not be yours but the chorus that was in-store
Is a portion of plenty more than I ever had thought before
Pray to God that my mother be blessed for many moons
All the nights she stayed up wondering what I was doing
But now she know where I'm goin', my granny had called it yonder
Headed up heavens highway to see my Father
I'm taking my people farther with this
Though at times a broken spirit make it harder for this
I'm caught up by when...

[Hook: John Givez]
