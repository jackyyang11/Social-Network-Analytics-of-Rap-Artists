[Intro]
Dreams, dreams

[Hook: John Givez]
Baby I'm a dreamer, a dreamer
(Dreams, I'm just living my dreams
I'm just living my dreams, I'm just living my dreams)
If I don't get it I'll probably go out by tomorrow
Baby what you think of, you think of
Living your dreams [?]
My soul, my soul
Yeah, it's on fire
My soul, my soul
Yeah, it's on fire

[Verse 1: John Givez]
My grandaddy was a drinker, my daddy is a dreamer
I'm probably just a prima
[?] world changer, let me manage from a manger
I'm a man entrapped in danger with a child-like faith
And I know what it's worth
Put me on the world stage, I'm coming from the earth
Fully aware of my creator
And I'm here to serve, swerve and perv
A dream junkie
The promised land, His promised hands
Help me be, oh, something Lord

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ruslan]
My daddy was a hustler, momma was adopted
Glad that her mother didn't take the other option
So many drunks in my family, wish somebody stopped it
But all these communists came together to make a profit
So I ahve no other options, the foolery ends with me
Yes Imma a dreamer, but I'm getting the least of sleep
Dream job everyday, on a flight outta state with the woman of my dreams
Never feeling like I gotta stay
Hungry for the Lord, never feeling like I gotta pray
What is next in store?
I don't know, but I gotta say the journey's been incredible
And we're just getting started
Turning visions to reality, that once were regarded as dreams

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Beleaf]
Poppa was a player
Now all of my prayers are against the nightmares
Saying, "I'm never satisfied"
I sat aside my ride, I told my wife, "We won't divide"
She's a mathematician, but statistics don't derive
With the spirit sanctified I never listen to the lies
Cause it always turns out my dreams take me by surprise
I never thought hip-hop would take me on a ride
But God gave me the gift and now my life feels like my dreams

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeah, it's on fire (x2)
