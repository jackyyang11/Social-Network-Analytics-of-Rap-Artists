[Intro]
Hey, welcome to Kings Dream
That voicemail message was like
The most robotic induced voicemail message ever

[Verse 1: Ruslan]
I'm a drop heat like a homicide
Then hit a retreat, see the common side
Draw more geeks than comic-con
Homage to the Jesus freak martyrs, no Comica

[Verse 2: Beleaf]
A to Z, I expose your rhyme book for plagiary
Ghetto blatancy, pulling my people out of slavery
Taking time to blink
To get that soul music to you
Best believe I'm worth the wait you'll see

[Verse 3: John Givez]
Know you see the weight on we
Repping with no burnout
Pressure make diamonds
We about to sweat your perm out
And turn in what got turnt out
And cut down what got turn up
That's what you call enjoying the fruits of a bloody murder

[Verse 4: Ruslan]
So a, I'm a married man I don't talk to common broads
He a wild boy, must be from his momma's side
North County resident but catch me at the Pramida
We gon' overthrow this boat like it's Amistad

[Verse 5: Beleaf]
And I'm the only black dot in the ocean
Boogie board, boogie board
Ashy, where's the lotion?
Causing all commotion when I'm coasting with my little brother
Little engine, I mean chugga-chugga locomotion

[Verse 6: John Givez]
I think I can, fit in the same size shoes as Peter Pan
And killing Captain Hook with the look that disturbed Peter's stance
In Passion of the Christ when the rooster had crowed three times
The caboose of the bros that ate
That's King David up in his prime

[Verse 7: Ruslan]
I'm rambling, evangelizing and dismantling
Other points of views, sing the blues
No more tampering
With the secret sauce see the formulas pampering
All these baby boomers, late bloomers stop bantering

[Verse 8: Beleaf]
I emancipate the um
I emancipate the um in my speech when I start to bomb on these beats
I am sure so pardon my reach
(Move over I belong here)
I mean can we switch seats?

[Verse 9: John Givez]
I mean can we get by?
Or at least just granted the vantage the point in your eye
And you see the 4th of July
Fire working inside the person that's deserving a death
But emerged from his bed and decided to serve at his best
Beleaf and Ru gon' probably tell me to get off of this beat
But this bars open and I tend to get off when I speak
And I'm far from the peak
I peek around the corner and see
That time is winding down for God to really offer you peace
See the mark of the beast is on it's way to carve into peeps
It's playing with the caution and see, that's far from the meek
Aye for real though, you need to get your life right
Kings Dream

[Outro: JGivens]
Well, Beleaf Melanin, this is Jeremiah Givens
And I'm saying that as a fan that you be encouraged
And this album's really dope
I'm acting like Iike don't know about it already, but you know
God is with you brother
Beleaf in the Melanin
Yeah, that's about it, now I feel stupid
And this is the part where I hang up
West Coast up, peace
