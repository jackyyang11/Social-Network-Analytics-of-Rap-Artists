[Intro: Ruslan]
I should be catching Z's right now
Dreaming and dreaming and dreaming and dreaming and dreaming and no
Know how
I don't do that
Let's go

[Verse 1: Ruslan]
Yes I am an immigrant
No I don't belong here
Paint the realest images like Jesus without blonde hair
Yes he is my God, bro
I am not a god though
I should not be worshipped, I was purchased
Only God knows why
I'm alive and set free of all my demons
Red told me when it comes to music, can't no one touch you
And I believed him
[?] told me the same thing
Beleaf told me maintain the main thing
A year I'm focused, you know my main frame
Here for hopeless, so I remain sane
That's my pastor's role
That's not a rapper's role
Maybe irrational, but I gotta take me a more active role
These MCs are cheesier than casserole
[?] without corniness, cast a stove
We the last hope, yeah, I suppose

[Hook: Ruslan]
This is for my Dream Junkies
You dream junkies
Even when it seems ugly
It's okay, the Dream Junkies
This is for my living, breathing people with a dream
Time to live it out
Walk it out no matter how it seems
That's what I'm talking 'bout
Yea, that's what I'm talking 'bout
Yea, you know what I'm talking 'bout
Dream junkies, dream junkies
This is for my dream junkies

[Verse 2: John Givez]
I remember dreaming when I was this little boy
90s baby played with little engine that could toy
Poppa was a visionary, he was so proud of me
Proper, pride, planet
Busting them dreams right out of me
Imma kill this, Imma kill this
Like a didn't have no doggone feelings
Just look at my appearance, I'm one of God children
Imma chairman in the air, man
Preparing to bear and give birth
It's apparent that you couldn't recover the ? of walking on this earth
(So reap what you sow dog)
'Bout time I go off
I'm about to blow the stove off
With a dream turned reality I can make a whole nation awake ? off
Though I'm winning
JC, Holy Spirit embrace me
I'm going in like the ? you see
We the salt of the world, we depart from the world
But we still live in it like HD
And I'm chilling with Beleaf and Ru
Get with it, what you need to do
Dream Junkies, we the crew
You seen the proof, we all about believe and truth
What's all this fuss about?
Go ahead and get your muscle out
Work hard, pray hard, live slow, and give mo'
This is for my...

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Beleaf]
Turn me up two decibals
Wiping off my spectacles
I'm eating beats, that's a double entendre
Instrumentals and vegetables
I would kill the track but that's unethical
I woul heal the track but that's a [?]
My daddy told me if someone hit me, "Better hit him back
Don't let him mess with you
If you lose I'll smack the black off of you"
Well that's a whole lot of slapping, captain
I'm as dark as a black target napkin
When the lights off they like, "Where did he go?"
Nobody know, but the way that we flow
Having a festival after the show
Having the best of both worlds
And you living the life that you loving and everyone knows
I'm snorting these dreams in my nose
Killing it like I'm supposed to
Still in the streets, I was feeling the freaks
And then God said, "I chose you"
And now I'm like his go to
Kinda feeling like Goku
Kinda feeling like the chosen one
But I don't know anyone he won't go to
And if you broken baby, let him mold you
And if you lonely baby, let him hold you
I'm living proof of His love and truth
About a year from now I'm like, "I told you"
So, let's Dosey doe
Let's dream with the King of Kings
Let's dance like we never did before
This is for my...
