[Hook - John Givez]
They say sleep is the cousin of death
But I'm a put in work even when I'm at rest
Don't you know that I'm a dreamer (yeah I am)
I'm a dreamer (yeah I am)
I'm a dreamer (yeah I am)
I'm a dreamer (yeah I am)
(x2)

[Verse 1 - Beleaf]
I go to sleep and I think what if my thought and my goals were in sync
Then I'd see snapshots of hope when I blink
And I ain't tryna be stingy with the art cause I can't
But I kinda got used to holding on to all the pictures I paint
We're a pain in the asphalt cause we're groundbreaking, we walking with  giants
And every step defying Satan, you see the alliance
Yo theBREAX just added a beast
Yo that's my brother by the way I'm Beleaf

[Verse 2 - John Givez]
My name's John Givez, I'm so infatuated with the way time is
Aligned with the divine, I never thought that I could
Break the cycle of abrasive titles, now I'm rocking with
TheBREAX, we waking up to David Childs all around the globe
And I'm kind of just the canvas God He got the stoke
Covered in that blood of Jesus lead me to that kind of yolk
That perfect quest, dreams are just a perfect test
And when I get to heaven ask me was it worth it, hell yes

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Ruslan]
Ruslan, guy with the name most mispronounced
Listen now, they think they going in but they missing out
This amount of passion and drive contained in the body
Alive, surprised anybody survived, bottom line I'm risen now
A Dream Junkie jumping for the team love me hunting
Leave the cave kill something, drag it home and build something
Of my own I'm still hungry, in his own I feel lovely
My wife cool, my life cool who cares who thinks of me

[Verse 4 - Beleaf]
Once again introducing the crew with nothing to lose
So we bulletproof in the booth and we bust a noose with a tooth
Beep beep, pardon me that's my own horn that I'm tooting
If you look inside my toilet it's instrumentals I'm pooping out
Devour beats pardon my potty mouth
I'm prolly the life of the party if you kick me out you'll lose the crowd
I make you smile plus when I'm rhyming
I'll show you things you've never seen like free ways chin

[Hook]

[Verse 5 - John Givez]
Yeah it's back for the second time just step in line and recognize the passion
I'll pass it to your papi, is a pastor me and the crew is chasing after
So much more than dreams this is destiny the distance of eternity it seems
Let me learn you what it means to be a dreamer
Write division make it plain, I'm flying with a team of
Piloting poets we like pint of the coldest, come get you a sip
Cause this plane is taking of, don't you miss you a trip

[Verse 6 - Ruslan]
Killing it quick, the villain is sick when the venomous hits
I'm like the zombie act designing on the minimalist tip
Time to take it back to Zion people in the streets dying
I just wanna do something that's as real as it gets
Sitting on my hands was never part of the plan
Take a leap of faith from Paul and Barnabas land
Dared dreaming of change the world but no one could understand
Aye maybe I wasn't clear tho, maybe I made it foggy maybe I was just a weirdo

[Hook]
