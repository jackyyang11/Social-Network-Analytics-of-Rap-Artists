All's I need is just a little time to get it right (x4)
All's I need, all's I need, all's I need, all's I need
All's I need, all's I need, all's I need, all's I need
All's I need, all's I need, all's I need, all's I need
All's I need, all's I, all's I need is you

[Verse 1: Ruslan]
Yeah (x5)
I can't conjure up another excuse, to justify what I've been doing to you
I'm thinking of you while I'm doing the most and I'm doing the least
So what do I propose?
But I guess I suppose maybe you would believe
If you knew all of me maybe i would be ghost
And I know
I know I can't take it all with me to the afterlife
At the after party after dark after hours
After everyone has left and I'm left with another sunset
Thinking maybe I'm the one that keeps passing life
But you, but you stay present
In the midst of all my messes, In the midst of these confessions
I know I can be more engaged
I know I can be more unplugged from the matrix that keeps on controlling my brain
All of the same [?], I'm aimless but I'm shooting out what i see
Til' I'm brain dead you're my favourite
Sincerely you're all that I need
Yeah

[Hook: John Givez]

[Verse 2: John Givez]
My cherie, I'm more (amour) than likely fallin' short in your garden
A hunnid (hundred) times
As Adam couldn't even go in your garden
I got up on your lilies leaping on the edge of your leafs
I leave tomorrow for a show I know my negligent thesis
Of how we go and go together
Oh whatever, I may
Never find another that console my soul whenever I needed
I bleeded blue in the riches of all your righteousness I dismissed
The idol that lives in me when I'm writing this
Is you

[Hook: John Givez]
All's I need is just a little time to get it right (x4)
All's I need, all's I need, all's I need, all's I need
All's I need, all's I need, all's I need, all's I need
All's I need, all's I need, all's I need, all's I need
All's I need, all's I, all's I need is

[Verse 3: Beleaf]
I don't talk to you enough (I don't talk to you enough)
You be tellin' me you love me and I keep callin' you a bluff (I keep callin' you a bluff)
I keep telling you to stay away from me unless you gon' shake it up
I just want to know what's up (sup)
You just want to hold me down
But I think you weigh too much
By the way, why you always in a rush? (Huh?)
Where is the fire? You're such a liar
You know about desires and all that
But you want me to say too much
What, you want me to beg?
You see that I’m close to the edge
If you keep pushin’ your weight around watch how I jump one hella finesse
I know I’ve been loving you less
I know that can add to your stress
I know you will love if I loved you, right?
But I got some things to confess
I don’t know what I would do without you
My fear of me feeling your doubts too
I’m afraid if I misbehave you gon’ put some relationships in the grave
Man I want to get away
