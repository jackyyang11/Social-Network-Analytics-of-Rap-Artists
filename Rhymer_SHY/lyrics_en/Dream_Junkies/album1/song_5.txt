[Bridge: John Givez]
Up jumps the boogie
Tip toe through time
Trust the boogie oogie till I free my mind
Touch the boogie oogie
Till I feel alive
I feel it inside
I'm feeling the vibe

[Verse 1: John Givez]
We like to, we like to jam
We got the funk
We like to keep our demands
Living with ten toes down
We got the pump
We like to keep our gas
We like to we like to fly
Get out the way
We about to clear out the sky
Ain't no fear in this guy
Ain't you feeling the vibe
Ain't you feeling the healing
I'm spilling this ink from a pen
For the homies doing time in the pen
Perfect time in the win
I ain't got nothing to lose
I ain't got time to pretend
And I got God on my side
Gave His life for the guy
Imma live with the Lord
Satan trying to take what I build, and destroy
Still a trill n- on my knees
And I'm praying that my feet don’t fail me now
I got the groove
I'm on the frontline
I got the move
I got some things that I got to prove
No one in the streets gone tell me how
I got the watch
I got some folks that
I got the touch
I had the dream
I felt the rush
I see your face
We all the same
I know you're hurt
I feel your pain
I am the one
I'm about to lean
I'm about to sweat
I'm about to bleed
I'm about to give you what you really need
I'm about to give it and you're going to recieve
I'm about to turn you down and to believe
I'm about to make sure you boogie with me

[Bridge: John Givez]
Up jumps the boogie
Tip toe through time
Trust the boogie oogie
Till I free my mind
Touch the boogie oogie
Till I'm feeling alive
I feel it inside
I'm feeling the vibe

[Hook]
Gangsters don't dance they boogie
We can throw hands
Or boogie
It's ugly
But boogie down for me
Put in work on this earth
Cuz the world don't love me nah


[Verse 2: Beleaf]
We got to, we got to ride
I got the wife
And my little baby got a smile
They don't want to let us in the spot
I ain't had the key
So you know I had to pick the lock
Stage fright keeping my stomach in a knot
I ain't never really want to give it all I got
But I got to give it up (Gotta give it up)
Cuz when the going get tough, the tough get going
And I'm Debo'in
I'm OD-ing
I'm all ODB y'all ain't seeing
Shimmy Shimmy all
Shimmy all like your all on my knees when I fall
When I'm running from the law
Never been a hog
Why you passing me the ball
Don't you know that I'm black and I'm proud of my stereotyping
Slap and a [?]
Hand and the rhythm don't let me down
I got the boom
I got the bap
I'm in the trunk
I got the thump
I got the slap
When your GPS fail I got the map
I know the way
I got the facts
I got the angels watching my back
I got the Junkies
They don't relax
Can't even give me a Kumbaya
Or even a Yipeeoo Yippee ki yay
It's the miggity miggity miggity mack
Daddy
Now I got no time to play
No time to sleep
No time to lose
I missed the button
No time to snooze
I'm about to blow
I lit the fuze
Telling you I got way too much to lose

[Bridge: John Givez]
Up jumps the boogie
Tip toe through time
Trust the boogie oogie
Till I free my mind
Touch the boogie oogie
Till I'm feeling alive
I feel it inside
I'm feeling the vibe

[Hook]
Gangsters don't dance they boogie
We can throw hands
Or boogie
It's ugly
But boogie down for me
Put in work on this earth
Cuz the world don't love me nah


[Verse 3: Ruslan]
We like to, We like to vibe
We like to chill by the side
We like to do what they least expected of I
I like to move and arrive
We are the, we are the guys who got to do more than survive
Leave you feeling alive
No pleading the fifth
On the fifth I was sipping, it may of not happened like Cinco de Mayo
Giving it all
Giving you everything never will stall
Baring my soul
This is not part of the show
This is not part of a role
Never a part of a plot of a movie you know
Or something you've seen before
Oh, wait a minute time don't fail me now
My son like "Dad don't you step out"
My friends like "Please don't you check out"
My God like "so you gonna work this out"
But you got to choose
As I deal with the things that are buried that will grow out
Weeds in my cemetery coming at me now
All I'm hearing is
You've got the moves
So you got to move
As if I'm some type of super human
You've been doing
Keep manuveuring things on the inside
God could you please explain what are you doing
Where am I going
Where is this going
I don't like to be in a place and not knowing
I don't like to be in a place where I'm showing all of me
Ya I know you the king
If I step out and believe
Would you be down to boogie with me

[Bridge: John Givez]
Up jumps the boogie
Tip toe through time
Trust the boogie oogie
Till I free my mind
Touch the boogie oogie
Till I'm feeling alive
I feel it inside
I'm feeling the vibe

[Hook]
Gangsters don't dance they boogie
We can throw hands
Or boogie
It's ugly
But boogie down for me
Put in work on this earth
Cuz the world don't love me nah
