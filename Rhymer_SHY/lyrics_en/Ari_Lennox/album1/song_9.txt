[Chorus]
Said baby you're the greatest
Of all time the greatest
So won't you hit my line
You're still on my mind

[Post-Chorus]
Said I ain't seen your ass in a couple months
But if you want it baby you can get you some
And all that conflict, we can work out
So gon head put this good in your mouth
What you about

[Verse 1]
Second time around
We can get it started like Black Eyed Peas in town
There's nothing to figure out, yeah

[Chorus]
Said baby you're the greatest
Of all time the greatest
So won't you hit my line
You're still on my mind

[Post-Chorus]
Said I ain't seen your ass in a couple months
But if you want it baby you can get you some
And all that conflict, we can work out
So gon head put this good in your mouth
What you about

[Verse 2]
Don't mean to impose
You sink into my body like we're Jack and Rose
Your friends don't have to know, yeah

[Chorus]
Said baby you're the greatest
Of all time the greatest
So won't you hit my line
You're still on my mind

[Outro]
You're the greatest
I said you are
I said you are
I said you are
I said you are
Won't you hit my line
I said you are
I said you are
Hit my line
