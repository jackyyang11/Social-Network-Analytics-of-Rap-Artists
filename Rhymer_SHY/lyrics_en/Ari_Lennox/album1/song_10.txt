[Verse 1]
I, ooh
Take the Queen Mary to the U.K
You know we got time
I just want you next to me
(yeah, yeah)
Playin' Sims 3 while you watch the game
You know we got time
Won't you come sit next to me?

[Chorus]
I said, why you gotta be a grampa?
Let a girl come and see you
Ain't gotta be a motherfuckin' reason
Why you gotta be a grampa?
Let a girl come and see you
(hey baby)

[Verse 2]
Maybe we can just stay in
You know we got time
Baby, take a hit of this
(don't choke)
Kisses to end all the fights
I wanna make you mine
Baby, just turn off the lights
Stay up 'til the daylight
(yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
Why you gotta be a grampa?
Let a girl come and see you
Ain't gotta be a motherfuckin' reason
Why you gotta be a grampa?
Let a girl come and see you
Gotta be a motherfuckin' reason
Why you gotta be a grampa?
Let a girl come and see you
Ain't gotta be a motherfuckin' reason
Why you gotta be a grampa?
(uh, uh)

[Verse 3]
Baby, is it a crime?
That I want your body over mine?
And we can do said anything that you want to
Lemme know if this shit true
Say baby
We go and fuck your hoes together
Don't give a fuck about the stormy weather

[Outro]
Hey baby
Hey baby
Hey baby
Put me on that brand new leather
(Ay)
Ain't no bitch that can do you better
Better, hey better
