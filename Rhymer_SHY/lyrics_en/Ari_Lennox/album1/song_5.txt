[Verse 1]
Kisses like marshmallow melts on my neck
A whimsical warming too sweet to forget
Lets get lost, somewhere in the night
Tell your stories and i'll tell you mine

[Hook]
I'm bound
I'm bound
I'm bound
I'm so in love in now
I'm down
I'm down
I'm down
When you're not around
Oh stay here
Stay here
I need you around
Stay here
Stay here

[Verse 2]
A nuclear nectar planted on my lips
Consoling serenity is all that you give
And you showed up when i felt so dead
I'm so torn up when you're not in my bed

[hook]
I'm bound
I'm bound
I'm bound
I'm so in love in now
I'm down
I'm down
I'm down
When you're not around
Oh stay here
Stay here
I need you around
Stay here
Stay here

[Outro]
Maybe silly dreams can come true
Daily doubting then i found you
Ahhh
Sometimes i wonder if it's even real
But i could never fake what i feel
Ahhh
