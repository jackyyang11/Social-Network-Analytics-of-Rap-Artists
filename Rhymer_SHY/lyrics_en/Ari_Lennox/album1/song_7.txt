[Hook]
Cocoa puffs falling in my bed
Whoa-ew-whew
That's the stuff that takes me there
Cocoa puffs falling in my bed
Whoa-ew-whew
That's the stuff that takes me there

[Verse 1]
Ain't nobody got it or can do it like my cocoa puff
When I'm feening, when I need it, he comes with it, that's the stuff
Chocolate wonder when we're underneath my covers, like it rough
All day dreaming for the evening when we're meeting deep in love
Smile is (beaming)
Steady (gleaming)
It's the weekend, it's just us
We'll be (chiefing)
Alchy (sipping)
Body touching breaking stuff
Gay like children, gay like happy we make earth, wind, fire, cool
Stay like legend, fly like Heaven, we can go for hours too
Thick like big boy, wild like Andre, saint like Noah
Bye, bye cool
Deep like teddy, hot like Marvin, hit like Barry
Oh so smooth
Phones are (ringing)
Bells are (singing)
We don't here them, la la la la
Noises (popping)
Neighbors (knocking)
We don't here them, la la la la

Whoa-ew-whew
That's the stuff that takes me there
Cocoa puffs falling in my bed
Whoa-ew-whew
That's the stuff that takes me there

[Verse 2]
Ain't nobody got it or can do it like my cocoa puff
Mama hates it, daddy dreads it, I can't seem to get enough
Mind exploding, self control and I don't have none give me some
In the bathroom, in the kitchen clean the dishes when we're done
Just keep (pleasing)
No more (teasing)
Body (seizing)
Get me there
In the (public)
Make them (upset)
Let them (witness)
I don't care
Deep like Lupe, grown like sexy, when you're in me, high like Minnie
When you touch me there's a tingling in my (woo)
What is this?
No socks, no clothes, wrapped like egg rolls engulfed along a steamy bliss
Fruit so ripe believe it's tight that pipe all night (release that shit)
Phones are (singing)
Bells are (singing)
We don't here them, la la la la
Noises (popping)
Neighbors (knocking)
We don't here them, la la la la
