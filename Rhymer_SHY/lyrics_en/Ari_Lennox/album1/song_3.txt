[Chorus: Ari Lennox]
Would you hit it how I like
Would you hit it in the back seat of my ride
And I know it's risky right
But I want it in the backseat of my hmmm

[Verse 1: Ari Lennox]
Oowee these fellas can't mind their business
You spank it so they know I'm taken
They don't wanna girl this crazy
Ooh we gon' steam up this parking lot baby

[Chorus: Ari Lennox]
Would you hit it how I like
Would you hit it in the back seat of my ride
And I know it's risky right
But I want it in the backseat of my hmmm

[Verse 2: Ari Lennox]
They might suspect, but who gon' check me
Ooh ooh this car is getting foggy
That brown skin all on my body
That brown skin done drive me crazy

[Chorus: Ari Lennox]
Would you hit it how I like
Would you hit it in the back seat of my ride
And I know it's risky right
But I want it in the back seat of my ride
Would you hit it how I like
Would  you hit it in the back seat of my ride
And I know it's risky right
But I want it in the back seat of my

[Verse 3: Cozz]
Look, there's nothing to complicate
Ain't no need for conversation
I'm sure that your body got a lot to say
You know that I brought a plate
Cause you told me you only work from 6-to-9
Wait you know I'm off at 8
I'm tryin' to contemplate and concentrate on where to take your ass
I think I got a place, backseat of my car
I ain't got a place, but baby you're my
Thoughts have been nasty
I wanna smash me a bad piece
Introduce her whole face to my family
You ain't gotta ask me what the plan be
The condom plan A, without one, plan B
Fill up your damn jeans
Finna know baby I spill that damn cheese
No hands, I use my teeth and pull down your panties
Then focus on that sweet thang, open your pantry
I admire her for her, I would hire her to twerk
I'm not inspired to search for nobody else
That gushy too gucci, gushy way flyer than a purse
The way we grinding in this backseat, hope these tires ain't gon' burst
Swear to God

[Bridge: Ari Lennox]
What good is a bed when there’s a hooptie instead
Said I want it now
Love me long time while I steam up your ride
I want it now
What good is a bed when there’s a hooptie instead
I want it now
Love me long time while I steam up your ride
I want it now

[Chorus: Ari Lennox]
Would you hit it how I like (Revenge)
Would you hit it in the back seat of my ride
And I know it's risky right
But I want it in the back seat of my hmmm
