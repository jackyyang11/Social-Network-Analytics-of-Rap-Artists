[Intro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Hey

[Pre-Chorus]
It's nice to be in love
What is that?
So give me fuck
Oh

[Chorus]
Said I just want your hands around my throat
So, oh, just a little choke

[Verse 1]
Ride around my Kia, ride around my Kia Soul
West Virginia mountains, we drivin' through the fallen slow
Don't be shy
The night is [?], we losing time now

[Pre-Chorus]
It's nice to be in love
What is that?
So give me fuck
Ooh
Sai-fuck, ooh
Sai-fuck, ooh

[Chorus]
Said I just want your hands around my throat
So, oh, just a little choke

[Verse 2]
Can I seep into ya'? I know your brain is slow
Let me piece it for ya' with Arizona clothes
(I know what you want, I know what you want)
Ooh, ah (I know what you want, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Let me seep into ya', make it clap
Like we in the Nolia, bring it back
Ooh (I know what you want, I know what you want)

[Chorus]
Said I just want your hands around my throat (Yeah, ayy)
So, oh, just a little choke (Just a little, just a little, oh)
Said I just want your hands around my throat (Ooh)
So, oh, just a little choke
