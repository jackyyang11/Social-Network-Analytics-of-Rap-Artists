[Verse 1]

Dnter the booth, soundproof could not contain what I spit
I never claim to walk around with a flame on my hip
I got a notebook that’s filled like a Mac 11 clip
So test me I’ll take you on a lyrical trip
Yhrough the sands in the mind of Blacastan
Disassemble bombs, like hurt locker teams in Pakistan
Urban Embassy invades the minds of our enemies
Perfect chemistry over throwing the industry
Real cats snatch it off the shelves in stores
While fights breakout at merch tables on tours
Fans swing fist over, t-shirts and disc
I never thought it was poss to get love like this
I’m on the sofa my HD clearer than real life
I’m sober my third eye clearer than real ice
55 AMG spinning with the Armor All
I’m catching Jumu’ah especially when it’s Ramadan
I get cake, they say I’m off of my deen
Cause the bags with the stamps cause niggas to lean
Packs get flipped, bitch niggas wings get clipped
So, whats new Chumzilla new version of Clue
You know how we do, pitch crack in front of the school
I came home with an X on my name
Flexing my chain, finessing the game
’96 mind frame it’s still the same, we still gonna body the game
When I go, my niggas throw doe in the casket
Bury me with mine, nigga I’m a filthy bastard
Salute me, 21 guns squeeze the ratchet
Police celebrating, like they buried the hatchet
NIGGA
