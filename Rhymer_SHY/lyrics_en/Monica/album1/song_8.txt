[Verse 1:]
Now here's the situation
Lack of communication
It's tearing our love apart

You play me like a ninny
'Cause I won't give you any
Now you won't call me at all

[Hook:]
But if you want me (yeah)
I'll be there in a minute
If you need me

I'll show you I care for you
And I'll always (always)
I'll always gonna be there for you
Oh, oh, ah

[Chorus:]
Love me, yeah
Boy, I'll be your angel
Love me baby

Love me, yeah
Boy, I'll be your angel
Angel, baby

[Verse 2:]
So much for your commitment
You told me you were different
From all the creeps that I know

Though you say you love me
That don't make it right
If you aim, boy
Then I'll promise you all of me

[Repeat Hook:]

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
(Love me, I'm your angel)
Everyone needs an angel
Let me be yours
(Does a little Monica ad lib right here? I can't write it)
Sho'nuff special
(Sho'nuff, sho'nuff)

You're so special to me
Sho' nuff special
So special
You're so special to me

[Repeat Chorus:]
