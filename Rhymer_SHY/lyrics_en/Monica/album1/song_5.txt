[Verse 1]
When them other girls
Ask you if I'm your girl
Say ooh ooh ooh
A diamond to your pearls
The only one in your world
Like ooh ooh ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh this, that love
And it's only between us
Pretend they don't see us, yeah
Ooh this, that love
Make you feel like you can't live without the only one

[Chorus]
I'm all alone in your heart
I love you, baby
You ain't, you ain't, you ain't nobody else's
You ain't, you ain't, you ain't nobody else's
'Cause my heart's right here in your arms
I love you, baby
You ain't, you ain't, you ain't nobody else's
You ain't, you ain't, you ain't nobody else's

[Verse 2]
Make that engine start
Kisses tear you apart
Like ooh ooh ooh
You and me together
As sweet as acapella
Like ooh ooh ooh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh this, that love
And it's only between us
Pretend they don't see us, yeah
Ooh this, that love
Make you feel like you can't live without the only one

[Chorus]
I'm all alone in your heart
I love you, baby
You ain't, you ain't, you ain't nobody else's
You ain't, you ain't, you ain't nobody else's
'Cause my heart's right here in your arms
I love you, baby
You ain't, you ain't, you ain't nobody else's
You ain't, you ain't, you ain't nobody else's

[Bridge]
It's us, yep, them others don't matter
Baby, let's go high, keep climbing the ladder
Got a bond so strong, yep it's far from over
Wait, wait, hold up
Wait, wait, hold up
When you do that shit to me I go bonkers
And boy, you about your shit, you ain't no talker
Money in my pocket, yup, I do whatever
I put whatever on us baby
Whatever on us baby
Yeah, woo, woo, waaah

[Chorus]
I'm all alone in your heart
I love you, baby
You ain't, you ain't, you ain't nobody else's
You ain't, you ain't, you ain't nobody else's
'Cause my heart's right here in your arms
I love you, baby
You ain't, you ain't, you ain't nobody else's
You ain't, you ain't, you ain't nobody else's

[Outro]
You Monica's love
You Monica's love
You Monica's love
Nobody else's
No, nobody else's, no
Give me my love
Nobody else's, you ain't
Nobody else's, you ain't
