Da da da da dum
Um um
Yeah yeah, oh, ho oh oh
Oh wo
Um, can I talk to you for a minute?

(VERSE 1:)
Inseparable, that's how we were
Through anything, you were my world
I gave to you, you shared with me
For the love of you, i'd give anything
I would chill with you
You and your crew
Never complained 'bout the things you do
But it see it now, how it all went down
Can't take no more
Don't want you around

(HOOK 1)
Never told me the whole truth
Now i'm wishing that i knew
The real you...
How could you do this to me?
Never hurt so much
I see, plans i made for you and me
They can't be...
These are the last tears that you'll see from me

(CHORUS)
Cause i ain't gonna cry no more
Cause i'm sick of you hurting me
I ain't gonna cry no more
'cause you don't deserve me
I ain't gonna cry no more
Pack your stuff up and leave
I ain't gonna cry no more
Cause i'm tired of you, me and she

(VERSE 2)
And now i can't believe all the things you did
All your secret trips, just to see your kids
What about the crib that i've never been?
Is that the one that she lives in?
But soon you'll see
That the man he's not
The "un-love" affair will soon be forgot
And you will miss me, but i won't miss you
You can pull the key, cause now we're through

(HOOK 2)
Never told me the whole truth
Never wishing that i knew the real you...
You didn't have to do what you did to me
Never hurt so much i see
Plans we made for you and me
They can't be
These are the last tears that you see from me

(CHORUS)

(BRIDGE:)
Used to think that you and me were in love for sure
But i was wrong ,cuase you led me on
But now i found i don't need you around
You gotta bounce
I'm tired

(CHORUS)
Ain't gonna cry
I ain't gonna cry
It's not the fact that it's your baby
But it's the fact that you lied
And you hurt me
Pack your stuff and leave

I'm sick of you
I'm through with you
I'm done with you
I'm tired of you
I'm tired of your lies
I ain't gonna cry no more
