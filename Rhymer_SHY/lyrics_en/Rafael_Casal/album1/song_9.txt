Intro

Just fall back
Just fall back
Just fall back
Just fall back
Yeah

Verse

You talking crazy
And I don’t mean to be mean
Or obscene or mistreat you believe me
I want you daily
But this don’t seem even seems like it's leaning
And ain't a reason to be lost or angry
I’m spent one thing at a time
Is it you or the rent?
You say you ain't asking much from men
But you don’t seem content with that other Clark Kent
I guess it's time to take my glasses off
Cus the way I framed it you were mistaken
Right as I’m leaving
Yeah blasting off
You’ll be back with the fans saying he’s amazing
Spent too much time catering to your favour
Now you expect the bow tie and platters
But you eat off of me and go talk to these actors
Love your hands and feet but on them I ain't waiting

Chorus

Because oh you're a whole lot of drama
(whole lot of drama)
And if so imma need me comma
Is for you
For you to fall back x 6
My mind's going crazy
Went 'round in circles
I, I just want my baby
But so many hurdles
So maybe if we go and take the night off
Might be something worth saving
Not so quick to write you off

Verse

I told her no no
What you’re proposing is a no go
I need closure your loco
Crazy talking that insane garging heavy weight walking
I'm so low
In both definitions
Both by myself and furthest from the ceiling
Bridge came down
My fair lady
Why did London have to go crumbling lately?
I left a little bread
I can make my way back if you rather go ahead
It ain't no thing I got too much lane to let one little speed bump crush my frame
I let the hub cap roll on
So long
Sometimes you gotta lose part go
To go on
Don’t get me wrong you leaving will burn
I’m merely saying without you
My wheels still turns baby

Chorus

Because oh you’re a whole lot of drama
(Whole lot of drama)
And if so imma need me a comma
Is for you
For you to fall back x 6
My mind's going crazy
Went 'round in circles
I just want my baby
But so many hurdles
So maybe if we go and take the night off
Might be something worth saving
Not so quick to write you off
For you to fall back x 8
Yeah
