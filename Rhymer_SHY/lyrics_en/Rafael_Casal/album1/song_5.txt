[Intro]
(One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
Two can be as bad as one, it's the loneliest number since the number one)

[Verse 1]
I hung with them gangstas, them boys, them hustlas, them pimps
Complained 'bout being the brokest but we owned the most expensive 'fits
We chased money, started fights, and hot boxed in the cars
Crashed parties and talked about life like we havin' a ball
Got tatted and got a rep, bitches, and harassed by the cops
Cuz we was eight deep in a Buick Regal slappin' some 'Pac
Some went to jail, a few of them they made it out the town
While the rest of us just fuckin' hung around

[Chorus]
Now they held me down
When life felt like a scam
When they kicked me out of school
And friends blew in the wind
But you were my main girl and I was your man
And, yeah, they were my partners but they didn't always understand
And it was you and I all kinds of young and dumb
Had plenty of random girls, but next to you they were none
Don't tell that to the cops, shit, we glad you didn't run
I'm just takin' time to thank you for bein' my number one
You know I know...

[Hook]
(One is the lonliest number that you'll ever do)
I want to thank you for being my bottom bitch
(Two can be as bad as one, it's the lonliest number since the number one)
You never lied and I remember that shit girl
Lun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun
Lun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun

[Verse 2]
I hung with them parkees, them skaters, them rappers, them brahs
Pill poppin' was popular so I just sold all of them drugs
And they were all goth and good, high as balls, slappin' hands
Smokin' wittle [?] through the slit of the side of a broken soda can
Chain smokin' we bust tables and went to acid land
And went taggin' with black magic avoidin' Azkaban
Little Cholo girls, white boys with ironic tats and thoughts
While I drank Cognac out of the bag I brought

[Chorus 2]
Now they held me down
When life felt like a joke
When I hated all the rich kids cause they'd never be broke
But you were my main girl and I was your hope
And, yeah, they were my friends but they didn't always know the ropes
And it was you and I all kinds of young and dumb
Had plenty of random girls, but next to you they were none
Don't tell that to the cops, shit, we glad you didn't run
I'm just takin' time to thank you for bein' my number one
You know I know...

[Hook]
(One is the lonliest number that you'll ever do)
I want to thank you for being my bottom bitch
(Two can be as bad as one, it's the lonliest number since the number one)
You never lied and I remember that shit girl
Lun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun
Lun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun

[Outro]
Now, Let's hear it for the ride or die girls
Now, Let's hear it for the ride or dies
Let's hear it for the ride or die girls
Yeah, Let's hear it for the ride or dies
(Now I spend my time just making rhymes of yesterday
One is the lonliest number that you'll ever do
Two can be as bad as one, it's the lonliest number since the number one)
