[[?]]
Delilahs Delilahs, been tryna pick the flower
I walked around the desert tryna pick out one for hours
But ain't no one around us, there must have been a drought, 'cause
The world has gotten heavy from tryna hold up the mountains
And so I go, get my dro, [pick somethin' ?]
I like the smell of Swisher O from the liquor sto'
[?] but keeps me alive as well, 'cause when I blow
I relax and dream about the roses and the lilies and the fly venus girls from the trap, trap

[Verse 1]
Last time I hit the bed, bed, I thought I found one
Most of their hearts are dead [standin' ?] from too much frownin'
I saw her open up and thought that she was ready
Then peeped her love was growin' on top of cemetaries

[Chorus]
I want your heart but it's hard 'cause it's pushin' daisies, pushin' daisies, pushin' daisies
Taught by all our mothers not to pick 'em if they're crazy, if they're crazy, pushin' up daisies
I want your heart but it's hard 'cause it's pushin' daisies, pushin' daisies, pushin' daisies
Taught by all our mothers not to pick 'em if they're crazy, if they're crazy, pushin' up daisies

[Verse 2]
I got the world lookin' like my adversary
She grew from the struggle out the ordinary
You can say what kinda girl you want
But they don't grow those around the places we grew up
They don't show up

[Pre-Chorus]
Delilahs Delilahs, Mama said pick survivors
Girls who aren't bitter from bein' in love with liars
I try to pick the pretty ones, there's something to admire
But most of it burns, just some of them are still on fire
And so I go, get my dro, [pick somethin' ?]
I like the smell of Swisher O from the liquor sto'
[?] but keeps me alive as well, 'cause when I blow
I relax and dream about the roses and the lilies and the fly venus girls from the trap, trap

[Bridge]
[?]
Tell me your problems
Bored of the sun like me
Up in your garden
I put you in my bed
Hopin' that I can save you
But I think you're already dead, I can't change it now

[Chorus]
I want your heart but it's hard 'cause it's pushin' daisies, pushin' daisies, pushin' daisies
Taught by all our mothers not to pick 'em if they're crazy, if they're crazy, pushin' up daisies
I want your heart but it's hard 'cause it's pushin' daisies, pushin' daisies, pushin' daisies
Taught by all our mothers not to pick 'em if they're crazy, if they're crazy, pushin' up daisies


But she grew from the struggle out the ordinary
I want your heart but it's hard 'cause it's pushin' daisies
Taught by all our mothers not to pick 'em if they're crazy, if they're crazy or pushin' up daisies
