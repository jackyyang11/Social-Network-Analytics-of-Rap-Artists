[Verse 1]
I killed my own fairy tale
When I knew that I could fall
I gave this every ounce of me
But it wasn’t true at all

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I obey such haunting walls
So foreign, they still feel to me
When am I
Free to be I
In this fantasy?

[Chorus]
I’ve been staring through the red veil for too long
I’ve been staring through the red veil for too long
And oh I
Have long been broken in
And oh I
Only I can make me whole again

[Verse 2]
There are tyrants in my home
I dance to keep unseen
What am I but marinade
On somebody else’s green?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I obey such haunting walls
So falling does appeal to me
When am I
Free to be I
In this fantasy?

[Chorus]
I’ve been staring through the red veil (the queen's rules) for too long
I’ve been staring through the red veil (the queen's rules) for too long
And oh I
Have long been broken in
And oh I
Only I can make me whole again
