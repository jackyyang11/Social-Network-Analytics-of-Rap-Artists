Sometimes I feel like I’m sitting in the back of Barbie & Ken 101
A class we’re all in but never seem to learn from
Some general ed requirement for students of American culture
One that convinces even the brightest of young women that sex is survival of the thinnest
And I’m sick of this education that doesn’t serve our best interests
My teacher has no face, she is every Revlon model women have ever chased
Her lectures can be seen in the backs of magazines, beauty ads, and marketing campaigns
Shit, just turn on your TV, this just in, a skewed perspective for today’s youth
Y’all ladies ain’t thin enough, fellas ain’t trim enough, wannabe sexy, y’all don’t go to the gym enough
Cut to commercial
C’mon, just tune, just tune into their maintenance team, tell you you’re ugly and then tell you how to fix it with Maybelline
Please, they just boding Barbie to fit the new trend
Next they’re gonna have club hoppin’ Barbie with thongs as accessories
Video ho Barbie, abusive boyfriend sold separately
Underaged Barbie, Kobe Bryant’s included
Or 9/11 victim Barbie and Ken is proud to get recruited
The problem is all this teaching are women’s decay
And my girlfriend is sitting up front, and she’s getting an A
This is where I start getting really pissed off, okay?
When the fuck did it become about
Suck it in I gotta get the bigger breasts
Shit I wanna fit a little better in dress
So lemme get a little skinny gotta fit into a little itty bitty size slimmer just to liven up the chest
Please, teacher, teacher, I wanna give my own presentation
Cause I have a problem with the class and matter of fact I have a damn problem with your whole administration
You’re the reason my girl won’t sit across from me in restaurants
The reason that she thinks she’s over fat in over ten spots
Less gut, less pudge, less looks, less real, more looks, more love, more Barbie appeal
Oh shit, fuck Barbie and Ken, fuck Barbie and Ken
They’re the reason 15-year old girls’ arms are slit
The reason 12-year olds think skinny is a compliment
And it’s too late, it is too late
I can’t write my way through these bathroom doors
So I raise my hand in class cause I can’t take it anymore
Teacher, teacher, your lectures are all backwards
You got mothers and daughters forgetting what matters
Because above hips, ass, lips, legs, and Uggs
The most real ass shit is women who don’t give a fuck
So screw all your teachings, screw all your teachings, your lessons, and plans
You skewed sick distant relative of the man
Your plan for brainwashing my baby I reject
I’m walking out of your class and I will proudly take my F
