[HOOK]
I let my shit bang out the trunk
Bang, bang out the trunk
I let my shit bang out the trunk
Bang, bang out the trunk (ah)
I let my shit bang out the trunk
Bang, bang out the trunk
I let (ayo) my shit bang out the trunk
Bang, bang out the, bang out the

[VERSE 1]
In California, we scrape
With the doors open at the stoplight
Push down on the gas, then break
That’s how you skirt out on the block right
Smoke everything in your wake
Better hope it ain’t a cop night
Freeway, that’s my escape
When I bake them grapes, grapes
I sling my shit straight out the trunk
Bootlegs, CDs, pills, and skunk
Rockstar of the parking lot
I am this fly, don’t need to stunt
Don’t even call me no punk
And there won’t be no funk
Won’t have a need to bring no punk
Shake you awake with my CD bunk

[HOOK]
I let my shit bang out the trunk
Bang, bang out the trunk
I let my shit bang out the trunk
Bang, bang out the trunk (ah)
I let my shit bang out the trunk
Bang, bang out the trunk
I let my shit bang out the trunk (ayo)
Bang, bang out the, bang out the

[VERSE 2]
I let my shit bang out the trunk
Turn me up, I got a bit stuck
And so I go when the curtain’s up
Imma let y’all know that I’m swerved as fuck
Herking, jerk in a plastic cup
Get back, get down
When I need a pick up
Imma pick up if you callin’ to get down
Otherwise, get back
I don’t waste my nuts
Haterade
Get off my nuts
Like a bandaid
Bitch, get off my cuts
I don’t need no features
I will eat ‘cha
Yes, I’ve reached a consensus
Yes, it’s us
Loud as fuck
Bang them drums til the neighbors buck
Bass so loud that it shake my nuts
When y’all talk all folks say is (what, what)
Yo, who’s this light shit for?
I don’t wanna be polite no more
Game needs new blood, I’m compatible
See, my blood type is raw
Yes, that car go low-rider
Low in that I’m just like my Pa
Windows down, system up
Drive slow as fuck, blow out my car

[HOOK]
I let my shit bang out the trunk
Bang, bang out the trunk
I let my shit bang out the trunk
Bang, bang out the trunk (ah)
I let my shit bang out the trunk
Bang, bang out the trunk
I let my shit bang out the trunk
Bang, bang out the, bang out the

[VERSE 3]
Turn the stereo a little bit up
I’m gonna erupt
And recruit
The rest of ya to come and do the clean-up
The best of them, I eat up
I’m scary in the Bay
If you’re married to the game
I hope you made a better prenup
Better run now that we up
Disturbing the peace
Cause when I heard the beat
Observe me turnin’ a beast
And then I come monster
Like a príncipe
Ha, put ‘em on reserve
Cause I’m terminally
Hot-served, but I like that
Personally
Workin’ a beat
The learning curve
Earning my grade
Gettin’ my green
They made it if you never been paid
Or if you didn’t take
On the game murderously
Wha’chu wonderin’ about?
Looks certain to me
But then again, I never gave a fuck about the law
With my windows down, system up
Drive slow as fuck, blow out my car

[HOOK]
I let my shit bang out the trunk
Bang, bang out the trunk
I let my shit bang out the trunk
Bang, bang out the trunk (ah)
I let my shit bang out the trunk
Bang, bang out the trunk
I let my shit bang out the trunk
Bang, bang out the, bang out the
