[INTRO]
Hey-yo
I gotta tell a little story
Yeah

[VERSE 1]
So
I was just another young man
Tryin’ to find a lady
Who would lie and hide my gun, man
Knew how to roll a good blunt
On the run, one hand
Somewhere in the land
Of the thuggin’ and the lovin’
I just wanted to be her husband
Together, we can make bread
And never stress the funds, then
I can quit fillin’ up this bus-bin
So I swept up a sista’
Who said, “Yes, I will miss ya
So I won’t ever leave ya”
I’m the lever, I will lift ya
Your levy I will never break
Baby, let me kiss ya
So I moved her in my crib
At the beginning of the semester, yes
We met in the winter
She went by Vanessa
I didn’t want to commit
But I gave in under the pressure
Damn, she has me as a scam
Givin’ me lip so legit
She had the upper hand
Handin’ me this whole list of relationship demands
And the clip I couldn’t quit
Cause her shit was the best in all the land
I said

[HOOK]
(Get out my life, woman)
Get out my life
(You don’t love me no more)
My mama raised me a feminist
So I remember the first time
I ever called you a bitch
(Get out my life, woman)
Say, get out my life now
(You don’t love me no more)
She taught me not to be no sexist
So I remember the first time, the first time

[VERSE 2]
She was my shotgun rider
My dick-suckin’ supplier
Nowadays, it’s like she wants to retire
But still keepin’ all the benefits from her supplier
So like HBO, I investigate her through the wire
She’s a bad chick for hire
With many different diamonds in her scope
Like kaleida, that she hopes Imma buy her
But my name’s not Visa
Please, need I remind ya
That I don’t swipe
I just lay down the pipe
And knock it out the Bronx
Like my name was Frank White
Baby, my shit is crack
I don’t need to bake white
But she be talkin’ back
Every day and every night
That girl is poison
Just like a snake bite
Death to the heart
If it hits the vein right
And yes, she’s quite vain
With a vial of cocaine
Whenever she feels like
Finding Cobain
And then shoots me down
Like a .45 right to the brain
I said

[HOOK]
(Get out my life, woman)
Said get out my life
(You don’t love me no more)
My mama raised me a feminist
So I remember the first time
I ever called you a bitch
(Get out my life, woman)
Said get out my life, girl
(You don’t love me no more)
She taught me not to be no sexist
So I remember the first time, the first time

[VERSE 3]
And I guess that’s what it’s like
Outta sight, outta mind
Cause when I wasn’t around
She didn’t mind lendin’ her behind
To any new chauffeur
Who offered this ho a ride
Or maybe she was the ride
And the chauffeur just drove inside
She rolled her eyes like dice
To get the prize
Crazy but you can con
If you put on the right disguise
And I got swindled
And spun like a windmill every hour
That is to say, she blew me
So I turned around and gave her power
And on that powder
Some girls feel superhuman
Or maybe it’s super-skitzo
This woman flipped on a dime
And when a dime like her flips
Sometimes you forget
That ‘chu were kinda pit
Before you ever put this bitch on line
See, mother always said
Treat ya lova’ with respect
But pops said if you get disrespected
You gotta check
So I compromised the view
When the two intersect
I said, “Bitch, I love you
Why are you always so damn upset?”
And then I had to jet
Or rather, make her leave
I changed the locks on her
And took away all her keys
But I guess she kept one up her sleeve
Cause in the mornin’, there was a line
Down the side of my ‘63
I screamed

[HOOK]
(Get out my life, woman)
Get out my life
(You don’t love me no more)
My mama raised me a feminist
So I remember the first time
I ever called you a bitch
(Get out my life, woman)
Get out my life
(You don’t love me no more)
She taught me not to be no sexist
So I remember the first time, the first time
