[Intro]
This for all the treal, real talk, young bosses
Pushin' a hard line out in B-Town, The O, The Rich
The Sco, Valley Jo, The Tank, San Jo'
Tha-whole-damn-yay, better know, I see you

[Verse]
The Bay done gave out presents like it was Christmas
Picked up and said but by so many towns
But they don't give us our due, for providing you
With slang for all of your mouths
Y'all runners and rippers, beezies and marks
That's ho's, bitches, punks of all sorts
Just tryin' to make scratch, guap, that's cash
Used to say bread, but gave it to New York
Y'all lightweight, gassed, but I'm gonna smash
Means you think you boss, but I'm murkin' yo ass
And murkin' is killing, I'm moving too fast
But try to keep up, cause our slang never lasts
We doin it movin', giggin', and ghostin'
While thizzin' and yokin', scrapin' sideshowin'
That's dancing and popping a pill that's purple
Spinning the wheel and driving in circles
And Oakland The O, Berkeley, that's B-Town
And out to The Sco
Got no business in The Rich then don't go
In the land of yayo
Where it's molly and barney, we sparkin' that dro
Where we all say fa sho, which turned to fa sheez
Which turned to fa shizzle, y'all stole all of these
Now it's whatitdo, what's really good
I'm thinking about it comes out as mightcould
Y'all so outa pocket, true player haters
Who took "player haters" and claimed as theirs
Ironic, so outa' frame
Just like the stunners that pop up in verses all over the game
Mouthpiece, let me spit at this bopper
Rewind, mouthpiece means I'm quite the quick talker
Real tough, real talk, real spit cuz cuz
But cuddie don't say cuz to the real bloods bloods
Otherwise they might pull out the burner
And then they might what?
Yeah, they might murk ya, I'm glad you're a learner
Don't trip, just get you a zip, or maybe twomp
Man, a dubb sack playa, that's a $20 sack, pymp
Saw you pop your collar
But when you tried to place where it originate at
Ain't not a one of y'all holla
But fine, don't acknowledge
D-boys came out by E-40 in '94 man, I put that on mamas
Put that on sithas
Smash on any non-believers from any other regions
Bending them corners, nocks gotta get served
Pockets is touchin', but I might want to get swerved
Choosing on a skully who might fly me to boston
And gimmie a stack to go stewie 'til I'm on one
And I don't have time to break down what I'm talkin'
But it's intuitive, that's why we reinvent it often
So quit cupcakin', get your cake up
If you want to put shoes on your scraper
Cause game recognize game, to a giant it's a small thing
Find a bopper givin' all brain
If I see you slip, I might pull a lick
Take off on any weak jay cat meanmuggin' out the whip
How much you got on it? Bet a new five
I'm stunting, getting molded in a whoride
Sippin' on Hen, ya smell me
Might ya-did-I-mean
If I want you to agree with what I'm speaking on, you feel me
Posted up 'til the homie swoop, scoop
Round the wayway
Where there's no fingerprints when you're making loot
L.I.P's and spit no fear
Thought your city made it up, lemme get this clear
We got yo '09 slang wish list here
But you can't have these, there's no gifts this year
Bietch

[Outro]
Just go ahead and marinate on that for 'bout 5 hours
By the time you snatch a couple we already be doin' it movin'
Politicin', shaking hands & kissing babies
You already know, Bay Area all day, I thought you thought
Bruh bruh
Oh boy
