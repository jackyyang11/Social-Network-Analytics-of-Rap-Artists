I got a thousand ways
Just to stay out the way
I got a thousand ways
To stay out the way

[Hook]
Ay, I got a thousand ways, to stay out the way
I got a thousand ways, to stay out the way
I got a thousand ways, to stay out the way
I got a thousand ways. Ay. I got a thousand ways
Police was out today, I was out the way
Jackboys was out today, I was out the way
They just said out the way, I was out the way
I got a thousand ways, I got a thousand ways

[Verse 1]
Took shawty to go see a play, it was Cirque du Soleil
Then we gone hit Broadway today, for Les Miserables
That's 200 miles away, nothing but smiles today
Just got a call from bro, he said shit was wild today
He said niggas came through and shot up the park, right where his child would play
My other homie just served him a narc, got locked with the sour face
Last time I was home got caught with the dub but [?] devoured the case
Been tryna find ways to get out the streets, I been planning our escape
Cuz man we been out here for way long, wasn't even 'posed to stay long
It's getting harder to stay strong, when police handcuff us when they wrong
I need a vacation like Jeezy, I'm OT taking it easy
Streets take you away from your family, look what they did to Mendeecees

[Hook]
Ay, I got a thousand ways, to stay out the way
I got a thousand ways, to stay out the way
I got a thousand ways, to stay out the way
I got a thousand ways. Ay. I got a thousand ways
Police was out today, I was out the way
Jackboys was out today, I was out the way
They just said out the way, I was out the way
I got a thousand ways, I got a thousand ways

[Verse 2]
Ay, you know how you always around, so you always be in it
Like shit can't go left in a hurry, and you can't get left in a minute
My homie brung beef to the block, but he wasn't outside when they spinnt it
Man I'd rather be out the way, cuz some shit you just can't prevent it
Even though my clip extended, I'm in this game tryna win it
I can't be out here for nothing, run to that check till I'm winded
Bout my business like suspenders, remember getting suspended
Free all my niggas committed, now I be getting commended
Run up like you crazy get ended, this really me can't pretend it
But I know that more was intended, I know that more was intended
I'd rather travel the world, than being called a defendant
Looking like a pretender, with a public defender, so

[Hook]
I got a thousand ways, to stay out the way
I got a thousand ways, to stay out the way
I got a thousand ways, to stay out the way
I got a thousand ways. Ay. I got a thousand ways
Police was out today, I was out the way
Jackboys was out today, I was out the way
They just said out the way, I was out the way
I got a thousand ways, I got a thousand ways
