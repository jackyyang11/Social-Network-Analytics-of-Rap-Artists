[Hook]
I ain't never had no money
(Never ever had no money)
Had no money yeaaa
(Had no money yeaa)x 2

[Chorus]
I ain't never had no money
Finally got a lil money
And now I want all da money Shawdy x2
Fuck that I want all da money
I want all da money
Fuck that I want all da money x2

[Verse 1: Lightshow]
I ain't start with money
Now I want all da money
I dont even pick my phone up if it ain't a call wit money
Fuckin Racks up
Stack 100s and 50s, Blow the 20s, change the 10s up for some 1s then hit the club and throw the money
Got no bitch I go with money, That shit go a long way
First name basis with them Prezzys, fuck with them the long way
Strong Jays in my trap until we go to sleep
But I remember nights when nigga we ain't go to sleep
I want all da money imma snatch it, its in front of me
I dont see nobody nigga. Its just my gun and me
Hooked on that paper look what it done to me, it turned me cold
And these new hunnits, not the old ones

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Lightshow]
I want all da money, I be taking risks for this shit
It be talkin to me, I be hearing whispers and shit
Got my pockets with the new bigs waste dreads I'm the shit
Time to hit GTown and cash out on my fit, I'm the shit
Imma flex cuz i ain't have me no money growin up
Young nigga but just look how fast my money growin up
Im way to blessd to be stressed
Check on yo head get you stretched
30 how much you can't catch
We bout that work you knew that
Walk downs
Run ups
Homicides we do that
Watch these niggas they be 50, They be flaky, See through that
Bitches too
Had to cancel one like Nino in new jack
I G Money Run through stacks
Like a kingpin moving crack
That's the Truth

[Chorus]
