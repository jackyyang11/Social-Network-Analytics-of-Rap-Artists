[Intro: Lightshow]

Man, whole rack of shit on my mind holmes
Yeah, Put that joint up some
You know I make this shit look easy because a boss supposed to
You know, I don't complain about shit because a boss a'int supposed to
You know, I got through what I go through
I take that shit on the chin and keep it movin'

[Hook: Lightshow]

Dear Lord, If I should die
Take me as I am
Forgive me for my sins
Take care of my fam
Make sure they know my heart
And everything I stand for
With my last breath thats everything I'm praying for (x2)

[Verse 1:Lightshow]

If I should die
Tell my bro I miss him
Tell him not to ever be a victim of the system
Let my little sister know I'm like this 'cus I love her
And I don't want to see a nigga take advantage of her
Tell my grandmother
How much a nigga love her
And how it went quick
And how I didn't even suffer
And tell my cousin Shaad
Hug and kiss my mother
And let me live through you
'Cuz you more like a brother
Somebody let my father know I went out with a bang
'Cus before I let them take me
I'mma let this choppa ring
Let the world know I died trynna be the king
And lord please open up the door when I ring
[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lightshow]

If I should die
Tell my block I tried
Let them niggas know I kept it G, I never lied
The fall of a man, is having too much pride
So tell them put that petty ass beef shit aside
'Cus we more like the mob
My niggas we a fam
Am I my brothers keeper? I'mma tell you "Yes, I am"
If we can stick together
I can promise us a check
We just gotta thrive off of honor and respect
Tell them pour some liquor out
Party, look at pictures
And never cherish anything you can't take with you
Tell them I a'int on no paperwork, I never fold
And let them nigga know I honored every single code

[Hook]

[Outro: Lightshow]

You know, A'int nothing guaranteed but death
And that's something I know
That's something I a'int runnin' from holmes
Just gotta make sure I got my shit together
Real live
