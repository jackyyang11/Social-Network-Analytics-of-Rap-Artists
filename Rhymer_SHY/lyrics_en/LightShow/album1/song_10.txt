[The Godfather Quote]
Don Corleone: Tell me, do you spend time with your family?
Johnny Fontane: Sure I do
Don Corleone: Good. Because a man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man

[Hook]

Cool
Cool
Talking business over pasta like its Sicily
Plus I tell em what I need an its gon get to me
Gave me the keys to the family
Feeling like the mob when im with family
Only talk to family
Only eat with family
Only talk to family to family
More like the mob around my way to sicily

[Verse 1: Lightshow]

Can't fuck with no new friends, they be enemies
Never met my plug but hes a 10 to me
Im gon get em off, fuck if its 10 degrees
Bout the family imma hustle like its 10 of me
My face Good in plenty cities, plenty streets
Might show up in your hood and then drop top
Swervin smokin Good me and my family
Hope the feds dont hit the lights cuz my Glock cocked
The way I see It, Blood dont make you family
All my niggas down to shoot you try your hands with me
I got bitches from DC down to Miami beach
And I bet everyone of them bitches take a stand for me
Real Live
