[Verse 1: Lightshow]
Lately I been buying guns and some great investments
Made adjustments to the team after I made assessments
I know plugs they got drugs we make cool deals
Won't sign for nothing less than a cool mill
Bring some Major fucking Pain when we do drills
Put these niggas in a group they look like Dru Hill
I be feeling like Plies kept it too real
If It's Fuck Me Then like wise and how you feel
I'm a stand up nigga known to stand tall
They 'ont want be balling want me playing handball
In a gray sweat suit behind them tan walls
But I'm in the paint like I'm Zach Randolph
Fuck 12, they just locked up half my damn dogs
Tryn' give us to the system like a hand off
We should have a stand off
Right after a hold up
Spend no dough on rollers, only on them roll ups
Yup, and I hope she fuck with soldiers
Hope you know we spiked the sodas
Look, For real
And you do everything the hoes does
We see nobody below us
We lookin' all the way up
Yeah, and I look like a check
And when you lil bitches mention my name
Put some Respect on that shit
Lightshow!
