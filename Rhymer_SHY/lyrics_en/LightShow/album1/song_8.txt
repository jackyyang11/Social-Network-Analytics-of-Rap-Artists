Brent Faiyaz:
She see money all around me
I look like I'm the man, yeah
But I was down and out like last week
Tell me where have you been?
You came out of hiding, girl
Don't act like I'm your man
You just a fan, you don't hold rank
Don't hold no rank

Lightshow:
Look .
She look great
She be lit
Her exboyfriend he the lick
He was sweet, he a trick
She call me when she need dick
Plus she choosy ,bad and bougie
That mean she get what she like
Make these niggas feel the pressure until she meet Mr.Right
I cant blame her ,its her life
I cant tame her she on fire
She a Libra,She a Liar
Ion even need her ,she can fly
Fucked her she told all her friends
I kept it between she and I
Alotta niggas cut her off before we met im seeing why
Cant finesse me ,she can try
Thats access that we deny
She obsessive ,sleepless nights
When I pull we get right about it
She wore that corset around me ,know I snatched her right up out it
Box so good I write about it
Ion write back to her texts tho.

Shy Glizzy :
Hey, nice to meet, I’m Young Jefe, who you be?
Got my piece in Southeast, got her clappin' to this beat
She invite me to her crib, I walk in, she see my heat
She said, "But I live in the hills," bitch, that’s just the way I sleep
Stop that madness, I'm a savage, in traffic with MAC 11’s
Baddest bitch and she Spanish, I fly her to Calabasas
We get nasty, I'm her daddy, she know a nigga ain't average
Ain't nothin' wrong with fake asses, bitch, turn around, let's make magic
I'm geekin', uh-huh, I'm on it, don't look at me like you want it, no
Tell 'em that we ain't stuntin', in fourth down we ain't puntin' it
King of District Columbia, can't come here without a permit
This shit really a jungle, gorillas and anacondas
