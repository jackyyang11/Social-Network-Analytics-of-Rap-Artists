[Intro]
I Don't Even Identify As A Fucking Rapper No More
I Just Feel Like Im An Artist, You Know What Im Sayin?
Im Just A Man, I Can Go In The Booth And Express How I Feel
This How I Really Feel Though! That's The Difference Like Im Not Just Putting, Rhyming Words Together

[Verse 1: Lightshow]
Its Too Much Money To Be Made, Lets Get Paid Before They Raid
My Streets Hot As Dade And We Aways Away From Dade
Life And Death Where Guns Are Blazin' But Stand Your Ground Don't Run Away
Unless Them Shots Start Ringin' Off, We Was Just Having Fun Today
Glad I Brought My Gun Today, Cuz That Shit There Can Change Alot
When Windows They Aimin' Out, Right Out Front Your Manor Spot
All This Game I Got To Give, It Came From All The Game We Got
Just Don't Call Us Names We Not, Nigga Don't Point No Blame Its Not The Way To Go
Nigga That's Not The Way It Go, Had To Say That Loud If I Was Low
Usually The Loudest One The Ho, And The Loudest One The Brokest
Tryn' Stay Out The Way And Focus, Or Strech Out To Where The Coke Is
What The Fucks The Law? When The Police Round My Way Is Bogus
They Pull Round Here Just To Throw Us And Run Names To Get To Know Us
Can't Fuck Money Up, Just Slow It Down, Usually When Its Going Down, Every Side I go Around The Same Story
Im Hoping Shit Change For Me, Cuz Im Not The Same Boy
Im A Changed Man, With A Gameplan... And Some Money In A Safe
For When Its Rainin' Cuz Bro Got 25 And Really I Could Be In The Same Can
Cuz We Both Was Speedin But My Shit Wasn't Hydroplanin'
And Its Not To Say I Ain't Never Crash Cuz I Did That, Had Them Peoples Runnin Up All Where My Momma Lived At
Still Ah Point This Chopper Where Your Lid At, If That Happen I Hope Yall Forgive That, I Hope God Forgive That

[Outro]
(This Shit Is My Life, And Then I Make It Rhyme On Top Of That)
Light
(And Then On Top Of That I Put It On A Cool Beat)
Light
(And Then On Top Of That My Man Probably Made The Beat, You Know What Im Saying, How The Fuck You Can't Respect That, How The Fuck You Can't Respect Anybody Taking Nothing And Make It Something)
Life Sentence...3
