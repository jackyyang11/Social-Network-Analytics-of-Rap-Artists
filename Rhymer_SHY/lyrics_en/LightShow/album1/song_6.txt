[verse 1]
Iont talk to people with badges
I get work sent to my address
Might take a trip 'cross the atlas
I keep a bitch with some asses titties and ass and cash and credit
I mean that shit if i said it
Next car i get ima cut off the roof
Closest you see to a bitch get beheaded
Fuck that lil money, burn it, shred it
Plug threw the work i am firmly indebted
Im bout a check lil bitch ass you could bet it
Way that i ran this shit up its pathetic
Im fucking prophetic, it must be genetics, it must be the broccoli, it must be the lettuce
That 8 and that 6 done got so fucking popping that iont gotta spell out the rest of the letters, i know niggas jealous
So its only the family, its only my fellas
That shit ain't nothing i been through the rain, burberry umbrellas burberry umbrellas
I just dont want yall to think its a game and then end up having to bury a relative
I just wanna count up the hunnits and you a distraction bitch that a negative

[hook 2x]
I know how to get through the rain, burberry umbrellas, burberry umbrellas
I paint a picture with letters
I paint these niggas as jealous
Nun like a hater im better
Dont be hater be better(3x)

[verse 2]
Dont be a hater be better
Dont be a hater...ever
Me and my gun Red and method
Thats 'cause how we stay together
I know how to get through the rain
Burberry umbrellas and sweaters
This OG gas keep me sane, they hating i grab more hunnits from the teller
I switch the gear on niggas, hit the lever
Swear my bitch rocking all this donatella
I know they plotting, body language tell it
You got the product, bobby i could sell it
No we ain't jelling cause you very jealous
This eddie bauer not no perry ellis
This dirty money older than your pops
Road to the millions we ain't making stops
Burberry umbrella for the rain
Might have the top down ina drop
Somewhere on m street for the eats
Pull up to city center just to shop
I tote this hunnit round 'cause the real shooters keep shooting when they miss a shot
Im at the club savage, pocket full of cabbage, tryna tell the bouncer its a knot

[hook 2x]
I know how to get through the rain, burberry umbrellas, burberry umbrellas
I paint a picture with letters
I paint these niggas as jealous
Nun like a hater im better
Dont be hater be better(3x)
