[Verse 1: Lightshow]
Okay my whole crew will come air it out
Internet beef we don't care about
My gun my favorite accessory
I like to put it on and then wear it out
That other nigga buzz wearing out
This young nigga shit turning up
Cali kush we burning up
While we counting all of these earnings up
Press niggas we don't iron it out
The back window when my arm is out
Let it off till my arm is out
Then swing back around like karma out
Cuz I hate hating ass fuck boys
Pussy nigga you fuck boys
I don't fuck with you fuck you
And I wish you bad luck too
All it take is 1000 bucks
To get my young nigga to pluck you
Fuck a diss cuz  I set the bar high
Now I'm the one they look up too
My mac told me show imma be quiet
But I'm screaming live if they touch you
I feel like I'm the fucking best
But I still ain't getting my just do
Figured out what I must do
That's apply pressure and supply stretchers
Hell naw I ain't looking for ya
But it's closed casket when I catch ya
Body parts in my damn trap
Got three five and a damn strap
Love the kids we don’t touch the kids
But I'll get your whole fam napped
Ring fingers get chopped up
Been here I ain't pop up
Came strapped when I showed up
Don't make me shoot the show up
DC like a old cup
Y'all slacking niggas y'all old bay
Matter fact y'all so pussy
Should be advertising for o-lay
Black gloves like I'm OJ
Get a nigga killed with a OK
Pot Rosay no Jose and
I don't trick off make a ho pay
Straight pimp no don Juan
Smoking weed with my bad man
Only niggas I'm signed too are
Sean Carter and Sean John
Was in the hood like bon temp
I breeze through like G's do
All my niggas going shoot for me and
I'm shooting too if I need to
Pockets deep as these B dudes but
Some bread crumbs in your head boy
Go to church if you scared and
Pray not get hit with this lead
Niggas talking wild but that's dead
Cuz ain't nobody did shit too me
And ain't nobody going to either
That tough talking ain't getting to me
If you want to get to the top
You little niggas gotta get through me
Lawyer worth like a couple M's
You see the ally he just threw me
In the court debt like D jack
Eight six nigga we back aye
Niggas love me in the hood like free crack
Make a dope fiend relapse
