[Verse 1]
I came a long way from jumpin' in windows for bags
From scammin' out ya momma for info, for cash
Now I'm bossed up, get ten G's a rap
Big money flossers, drive Bentleys and RAVs
I own businesses on my business shit
And only thing, you need to mind your business bitch
I've been her, I've been that, I've been this bitch
Can't understand 'cause you ain't never been this lit
And I know you hate to see me livin' this great
But you ain't got the tools to make the moves I make
All you niggas lose, we got views by lakes
At a house in the hills drinking brews by Drake's
They told that I couldn't, guess what? I did
My bank account's full I got a big ass crib
And one of my diamonds fall, it'll leave a big ass dent
'Cause I've been her, I've been that, I've been this bitch

[Chorus]
Dope bitch, dope bitch
Dope bitch, straight up outta Oakland
Dope bitch, dope bitch
Dope bitch, straight up outta Oakland
Dope bitch, dope bitch
Dope bitch, all she do is dope shit
Dope bitch, dope bitch
Dope bitch, all she do is dope shit

[Verse 2]
Coldest chick on two feet that you prolly ever saw
Illest chick alive in some panties and a bra
Fuck with big dawg, I don't fuck with broads
Never trust a bitch 'cause these hoes all frauds
Cold-mack a nigga, got a cold-mackin' Nina
This lavender Glock will make you do the macarena
Bitch, please, bitch, please
My K-Swiss cost more than your weave, with ease
Hey ho, you's a broke bitch
I'm a dope bitch, straight up outta Oakland
4Hunnid, who y'all don't want funk with
Fuck around with the gang and get stomped in
And I'll prolly be the realest bitch to ever come around
Live this life and get old enough to quote it
If you fuck around with me, you'll get stomped in the ground
Don't jump, bitch, or try to be heroic
'Cause I'm a

[Chorus]
Dope bitch, dope bitch
Dope bitch, straight up outta Oakland
Dope bitch, dope bitch
Dope bitch, straight up outta Oakland
Dope bitch, dope bitch
Dope bitch, all she do is dope shit
Dope bitch, dope bitch
Dope bitch, all she do is dope shit

[Bridge]
Say you a queen then you gotta be a dope bitch
If you want a ring then you gotta be a dope bitch
High self esteem, goddammit you's a dope bitch
Girl, you a dope bitch, girl, you a dope bitch
Wanna get paid then you gotta be a dope bitch
She self-made then she gotta be a dope bitch
Don't play no games, goddammit you's a dope bitch
Girl, you a dope bitch, girl, you a dope bitch

[Chorus]
Dope bitch, dope bitch
Dope bitch, straight up outta Oakland
Dope bitch, dope bitch
Dope bitch, straight up outta Oakland
Dope bitch, dope bitch
Dope bitch, all she do is dope shit
Dope bitch, dope bitch
Dope bitch, all she do is dope shit
