[Hook]
Come back don’t you come back, come to me once you leave
Your bullshit I don’t want that, Nigga please pass with ease
Now you are lonely, when you had me you didn’t want me
You are so fake and so phony
Young Queen, do my thing, I do my thing, do my thing

[Verse 1]
I thought you were my boyfriend, thought you were my King
Thought you were my world, thought you were my everything
Said you’d hold me down through whatever love would bring
Broke my fucking heart, had to fuck around and leave
Six years of bullshit, I was so young and so clueless
I take you back once you do shit, not knowing how I look stupid
Now you can’t stop calling me, social media stalking me
Why when you had all my love, you didn’t give your all to me?
Fuck around kept dogging me, slept around with all the freaks
So I had to dip out
And I’ll forever be the one that you missed now
Yea you missed out, so

[Hook]
Come back don’t you come back, come to me once you leave
Your bullshit I don’t want that, Nigga please pass with ease
Now you are lonely, when you had me you didn’t want me
You are so fake and so phony
Young Queen, do my thing, I do my thing, do my thing

[Verse 2]
I told you it was over six weeks, fuck
You been calling me for six days, what?
I don’t have no time for sick games, bluh
You don’t want me so quit playing, uh
I just think you really love to chase me, uh
This ain’t really love, it’s a safety, uh
You just know you never can replace me, nah
Know I’m everything that she just can’t be, huh
Your new chick be a downgrade
She’s a freak of the week, I’m straight
If you told her that you never was in love with me
Tell the truth, we both know that sounds fake
I make them moves that them bitches can’t make
But the dudes, that’s that shit you can’t take
And I can’t stand it, not even with me
But you’re demanding, goddamnit

[Hook]
Come back don’t you come back, come to me once you leave
Your bullshit I don’t want that, Nigga please pass with ease
Now you are lonely, when you had me you didn’t want me
You are so fake and so phony
Young Queen, do my thing, I do my thing, do my thing
