[Pre-Chorus]
Miss Maxines we don’t match denim
Designer sneaks with the black [?]
When I hit the scene they all drop [?]
Fresh as can be, they all jock my style

[Chorus]
I’m addicted to fashion, fashion
Check my style, oh I be swaggin’
I’m addicted to fashion, fashion
When I [?] I be splashin’

[Verse 1]
I’m so smooth, I’m so cool
Pull up to the scene and I’m [?]
[?] out the valet they all check my shoe
Bought so many [?] they respect my crew
Call a [?] I need another [?] please
I cannot be seen with a scuff on my sneaks
I prefer sweats, yes, before I rock jeans
Not original then you’re out of my league
Check my cards in, I got a lot of clothes
Tags on my rags there’s a lot of those
Fresh as can be it’s not optional
Cool as a breeze, I’m phenomenal
My style is so different
It cannot be copied
Brave my bitch, I’m dipping
The name’s YaYa, the first name auntie

[Pre-Chorus]
Miss Maxines we don’t match denim
Designer sneaks with the black [?]
When I hit the scene they all drop [?]
Fresh as can be, they all jock my style

[Chorus]
I’m addicted to fashion, fashion
Check my style oh I be swaggin’
I’m addicted to fashion, fashion
When I [?] I be splashin’

[Verse 2]
I’m addicted to fast money, cars, and fashion
I’m addicted to foreign women with fat asses
I’m addicted to Mary Jane with a passion
Roll it up, inhale, exhale, pass it
Remember when I was chasing hoes, skipping classes
Now, I fill out up in summer clean, versace glasses
Drippin’ from my head to feet they call it splashin’
[?] N*gga would hate on me then get your ass kicked
Grew up around some fly niggas,who kept me laced
Next to henny with [?] no chase
My homie told me slow and steady, don’t race
We’re on like a marathon so keep pace
God give me style, God give me grace
I’m trying to [?] blueface
[?] fucking gas to the face
She like my style now that’s good taste
Yeh
