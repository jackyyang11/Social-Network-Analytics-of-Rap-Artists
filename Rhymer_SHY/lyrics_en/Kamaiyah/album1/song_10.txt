[Intro]
No I ain't got the answers to this
I'm wondering if this is as bad as it gets oh
Will you pass or you live
Why is it that my best friend has this cancer and shit no
We had laughed up as kids
In different situations by my side where you been so
I'm by your side like a hip
I write this out with you by your side 'til the end no

[Verse 1]
No I don't have the answers
Why is it that my best friend has this cancer
And everything around me doesn't matter
They say it's in his body growing faster
It's growing faster
What is this bad luck
I'm losing my best friend, getting my cash up
The chemo that he has they say is standard
But that shit going bad, it hasn't backed up, it hasn't backed up
It has his back against the wall, scared that he will fall
I see it in his eyes, see the doubt and see the flaws
I got him through forever cause forever he my dog
On his floor where I sleep, when he need me he just call
Cause I'm a real one
And I can't give a fuck about these millions
And I will give it up to see him live on
To raise his daughter up cause she's so brilliant
Cause she's so brilliant

[Hook]
This is for my dawg
This is just a record for my dawg
For my dawg
This is just a record for my dawg
For my dawg
This is just a record for my dawg
For my dawg
This is just a record for my dawg

[Verse 2]
Now Fred
There's so many words left unsaid
I mean it from the heart if I could change it you'll be here
I said I wish you'd die, didn't mean that shit for real
When I heard you really died, man, that shit just gave me chills
We were trippin'
Arguing over dumb shit off the liquid
I said a lot of shit and if I could I'd do it different
I never understood until I got in this position
That family means the most to me and you are what we missin'
Now [?]
I got his back and got it faithfully
This isn't make believe
Man, you gone is not a dream
I pulled up to your funeral, somebody hit the beat
I still walked inside to see you put to rest in peace
And it fucked me up
I feel I got a problem, getting drunk too much
I drink it out the bottle, still not drunk enough
I can't apologize because I fucked it up
Man, I fucked it up

[Hook]
This is for my dawg
This is just a record for my dawg
For my dawg
This is just a record for my dawg
For my dawg
This is just a record for my dawg
For my dawg
This is just a record for my dawg
