[Pre-Chorus]
You have had someone that comes and breaks you down
Never had someone to come and make you smile
You just need someone to come and show you love
You just need someone to come and build you up

[Chorus]
Build you up, build you up
Build you up, build you up
Build you up, build you up
Build you up, build you up

[Verse 1]
Had someone to come around and break you down
Never had someone to come around and show you love
Had someone around to come and take away
Never had someone around to come and build you up
And this is killing you
Nothing's real to you
No one's feeling you
To come and handle you
You don't need no one, you've got to love yourself
'Cause when you get [?]
Won't need nobody else
Say "I gotta love me"
Say "I gotta trust me"
Say "I gotta give myself some pride"
Say "I gotta hug me"

[Pre-Chorus]
You have had someone that comes and breaks you down
Never had someone to come and make you smile
You just need someone to come and show you love
You just need someone to come and build you up

[Chorus]
Build you up, build you up
Build you up, build you up
Build you up, build you up
Build you up, build you up

[Verse 2]
Give me the microphone and check it
Should be no one neglected
Should be no disrespectin' if someone is in your presence
Don't accept it
A queen is a queen of all things
Respected by all means, uplifted by all kings, na' mean?
If he don't show you love then he's less than
Never stress it, tell that brother get to steppin'
The message is if he's real enough to build you up
Then he should really love, and try to build you up, sho' 'nough
Love yourself, hug yourself
And never put nobody else above yourself
If you a queen, off top, you should know that there
Speak life into yourself, you should show that there
Hold yourself to a standard, we know that's real
Show respect, well-mannered, and own that care
Bein' a queen really means you gotta show yourself love
You gotta be strong enough to build yourself up

[Pre-Chorus]
You have had someone that comes and breaks you down
Never had someone to come and make you smile
You just need someone to come and show you love
You just need someone to come and build you up

[Chorus]
Build you up, build you up
Build you up, build you up
Build you up, build you up
Build you up, build you up
