Hey yeah
Hey yeah

[Chorus]
You got a girl at home
But she know that you creep
Out to be with me
From your responsibilities
She put you on a leash
But here is where you sleep
She don't give you peace
I bring you your tranquility
Sneaking and creeping
Sneaking and creeping
Sneaking and creeping
Sneaking and creeping

[Verse 1]
I come through and I swag by
She know my whip when I pass by
I bet you that girl get some act right
If she knew the shit we did last night
If she don't ask no questions
Then i don't have no answers
Vow to keep it player
No matter what she ask us
She don't know what I know
Got you in my eyes closed
You'll never sleep with her
For as long as I'm home

[Chorus]
You got a girl at home
But she know that you creep
Out to be with me
From your responsibilities
She put you on a leash
But here is where you sleep
She don't give you peace
I bring you your tranquility
Sneaking and creeping
Sneaking and creeping
Sneaking and creeping
Sneaking and creeping

[Verse 2]
I know it's wrong but I wanna
And I don't care about karma
Send you home in the morning
To keep us from getting caught up
She all on my gram
Looking for her man
The only thing I post
Is me all with friends
Love all night it last long
Detox keep it casual
He's at my crib you had those
Shawty will get passed on

[Chorus]
You got a girl at home
But she know that you creep
Out to be with me
From your responsibilities
She put you on a leash
But here is where you sleep
She don't give you peace
I bring you your tranquility
Sneaking and creeping
Sneaking and creeping
Sneaking and creeping
Sneaking and creeping
