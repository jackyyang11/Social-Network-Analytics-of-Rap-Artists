[Hook]
You keep saying you don't want me
But your actions screaming loud
Bet you gon' put me when nobody is around
I can break you down, break you down, break you down
Can break you down, break break, break you down
I can break you down, break you down, break you down
Can break you down, break break, break you down

[Verse 1]
You need a girl that treats you right
You need a girl that freaks you right
In the morning, in the evening
That could freak you through the night
Though I keep it tight, I say "Hell. yeah"
Bump and grind, I say "Hell, yeah"
Work your mind, get you open wide
Won't be satisfied, can't go elsewhere
We'll be making love like it's going out of style
Freak you on the bed, on the floor and the couch
Can see it in your eyes that when nobody is around
You gon' put it down

[Hook]
You keep saying you don't want me
But your actions screaming loud
Bet you gon' put me when nobody is around
I can break you down, break you down, break you down
Can break you down, break break, break you down
I can break you down, break you down, break you down
Can break you down, break break, break you down

[Verse 2]
Can you satisfy my appetite?
When I get it up, can you put it down, let me act it right?
Don't be acting shy, go 'head and relax your mind
Cause I'm a freak like you and it's maximized
We can freak it, boy, we can freak it
And we ain't gotta tell no one, it's our secret
And I can see it in your eyes that you really want me
And you gon' put it on me

[Hook]
You keep saying you don't want me
But your actions screaming loud
Bet you gon' put me when nobody is around
I can break you down, break you down, break you down
Can break you down, break break, break you down
I can break you down, break you down, break you down
Can break you down, break break, break you down

[Hook]
You keep saying you don't want me
But your actions screaming loud
Bet you gon' put me when nobody is around
I can break you down, break you down, break you down
Can break you down, break break, break you down
I can break you down, break you down, break you down
Can break you down, break break, break you down
