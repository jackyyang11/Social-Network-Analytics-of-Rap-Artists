[Verse 1]
I, I, I
Man, I could put you in the passenger seat
While we’re smashing the Jeep
Jo and Zay in the back, both passing the weed
Puff one, puff two
Pass and repeat
No, I don’t smoke
Pass me the drink
As we proceed to get funkdafied
Riding the streets, getting on tonight
No, we ain’t going home tonight
You know how we do it, we get Oakland live
I’m just riding, chilling; this is how I’m living
Watch me swerve and get no ticket
Put your blunts up if you feel it

[Hook]
We ain’t going home tonight, nah
We getting on tonight, oh
(Repeat 1x)

[Verse 2]
I, oh, I, oh
I pull up in the drop top Jeep, baby
Top drop, parking lot full of freaks, baby
Passing shots, give me what I need baby
No Cîroc, only sip Hennessy, baby
And even though they tell us not to drink and drive
We’re going to keep this lit, passing drinks tonight
Well hella weed getting puffy, passing the dutchie
But I never touch it cause the trees, I don’t fuck with

[Hook]
We ain’t going home tonight, nah
We getting on tonight, oh
(Repeat 1x)

I, oh, I, oh
We ain’t going home tonight
No, we ain’t going home tonight
We ain’t going home tonight
No, we ain’t going home tonight
Do you really wanna come roll with me?
Do you really wanna come roll with me?
Do you really wanna get on with me?
Taking shots, pouring strong with me?
