[Verse 1]
Still dream of that Bentley truck, and I'ma try to buy it
I used to think about giving up, I cannot deny it
In this prison crate and I feel like I'm dyin'
Tell 'em I'm a lion, tell 'em I'm a giant
Tell 'em folks I'm never quitting, until I did it
For every nigga sitting in prison, I'm representing
Send flowers to all of our women and ask the lord to forgive me
Lil Ralo in the building, I came from pimping and stealing
I just took my bitch to the club and she made it rain
Of course you never changed, look how far young nigga came
They put dirt on our name, how the fuck real can be lame
Remember I ain't have a thang, they should be proud of what I gained

[Chorus]
Somebody better tell 'em I never fold under pressure
Every day we goin' extra and tell 'em I never settle
Never settle for these niggas, never settle for these bitches
I got the world attention, tell 'em sit back and just listen
Ralo came from the bottom, I didn't have a dollar
Remember begging for tomorrow, riding my Impala
Remember we ain't have nada, now we got a lotta
Everything, heaven came

[Verse 2]
I told my mama I'd never give up
None of them changes didn't ever help us
I know they wishin' that prison kept us
We go to war and it's us against us
They see the black against black
They see the world on my back
They see the police attack
They do not worry 'bout that
How can we ever relax?
They know that rule for a fact
My dog ain't never gettin' out of prison
Sometimes I wish that he never did it
He twenty-two with a life sentence
What he gon' do with a life sentence?
What he gon' do for the rest of his life?
Sometimes we do wrong to try to get right
We make them sacrifices every night
Just to buy us something that we gon' like

[Chorus]
Ralo came from the bottom, I didn't have a dollar
Remember begging for tomorrow, riding my Impala
Remember we ain't have nada, now we got a lotta
Everything, heaven came
Somebody better tell 'em I never fold under pressure
Every day we goin' extra and tell 'em I never settle
Never settle for these niggas, never settle for these bitches
I got the world attention, tell 'em sit back and just listen
