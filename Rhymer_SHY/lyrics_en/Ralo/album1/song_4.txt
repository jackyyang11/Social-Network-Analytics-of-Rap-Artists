(Throwin' gasoline to that fire, you dig what I'm sayin?)

[Verse 1]
I just had a kid by you
That don't seem to satisfy you
I know you title me a liar
You just caught me in denial
Don't you add gas to the fire (Don't do it!)
Baby, don't you add no gas to the fire (Put out that gasoline)

[Hook]
You know you got that fire
You know that, that head good
I just had to say good
They don't know it that good
You'll be layin' next to it
I use to holla let do it
That's that gasoline fluid
You put that fire to the wood
That burn that bih down

[Verse 2]
Ain't no pussy like that baby momma' pussy (nope)
I love that girl pussy like I love my momma cookin' (momma!)
She came in like a bullet
Said that dick is gon' be tookin'
I like the way she lookin'
I think she wanna book me (Holla!)
She wanna suck on the mic
She gonna be sangin' all night
I know that she's not right, about making my wife
And none of these bitches my type
None of these bitches be fuckin' me right
None of these bitches polite
We gon' be fuckin' for life (Let do it)
You know you my favorite food
You my favorite color
I love you like my mother
Trust you like you my lil brother
Remember when we used to call?
All we had was each other
They know I still love her
And I still wanna fuck her

[Hook]
You know you got that fire
You know that, that head good
I just had to say good
They don't know it that good
You'll be layin' next to it
I use to holla let do it
That's that gasoline fluid
You put that fire to the wood
That burn that bih down

[Verse 3]
Head? (good) Check
That pussy wet? Check
She ride the gun? (yeah)
I promise she the best
I like when she undress
I know she about to make a mess (huh?)
She never tell me no
She always tell me yes
She can't get me out her face
I need that pussy everyday and every way, is that okay?
Best believe I'm a bust a new [?] baby
I know you cryin' but here to wipe out your tears baby
This shit is still crazy
I know we love each other
We don't fuck with a rubber
I cannot find another
You kept me out of trouble
If I had no shit I'd have you
Fuck whoever had you, but I ain't never shared you

[Hook x2]
You know you got that fire
You know that, that head good
I just had to say good
They don't know it that good
You'll be layin' next to it
I use to holla let do it
That's that gasoline fluid
You put that fire to the wood
That burn that bih down
