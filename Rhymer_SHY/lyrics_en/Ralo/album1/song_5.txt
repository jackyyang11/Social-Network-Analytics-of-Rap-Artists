[Intro]
Ralo
See, I remember
I remember they was sayin' "trays up" when I was locked up
Now I gotta whole meal
I mean, [?] whole meal

[Verse 1]
They tried to lock me down
Instead, I locked it down
I came from sellin' them rocks, but look who rockin' now?
I don't weigh 200 pounds, but got 200 pounds
The same hoes said fuck me tryna fuck around
That lil nigga makin' money, that lil nigga done made it
Man, I'm tired of doin' favors, I'm everybody's favorite
Ain't get our education
I was incarcerated
Ain't have a pen and paper
I had a pot of Pesos
Made the money will save you
I ain't doin' no racin'
Fuck being in first place
They could never replace me
They could never replace me
Fuck being in first place
They could never replace me

[Hook]
The judge ain't got more money than me
Police ain't did more gunnin' than me
Fuck ya bitch once
All these bitches want me
All these bitches want me
Fuck the D.A
Tell em bout who run the A
Lord, I pray for better days
But I can't put these guns away
Lord, I pray for better days
But I can't put these guns away

[Verse 2]
Ever since I got rich, they see that I exist
Cause ain't too many niggas livin' life like this
Ain't too many niggas lived to do the shit we did
Moved bricks as a kid
Servin' grown men
I just parked the Bentley, Bluff
We came from 'round the bus
They told me never trust
I trusted too much
Gave my oath to these niggas
Gave my heart to these hoes
[?]
I'm bad at sayin' no
They got at my progress
I came from the projects
Hoppin' out from private jets
Jumpin' into Corvettes
They told me I wasn't gon make it
But I made it
You can't take it from me
Only God can judge me
Fuck ya honor

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I bought my crew more guns than our hands can use
But back to school, I'm buyin' all of my kids fancy shoes
Just so they can ask what do they parents do
Now you wonder how my kids get better pants than you
How the hell I'm scared of alligators and they on my feet?
Look mama, I'm on TV
[?] we held it down
You ain't never let me know
All that shit they used to say
They'll never tell me now
They don't treat me like a bug no more, they treat me like the man
Bitches beggin' me to do right, but they ain't write me then
When I was sittin' in prison, they ain't listen or visit
They ain't send me a penny, how could they use it against me?

[Hook]
