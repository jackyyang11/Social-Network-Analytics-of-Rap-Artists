Lee Boy on the track

[Intro]
Ay partner, I go by the name of Ralo Famgoon
Shit, [?]
So you know me, I come from a different [?]
All the niggas like me, they either dead or in prison
And there ain't too many niggas that gon' listen to this shit, 'cause there ain't too many niggas like me you dig

[Verse 1]
They used to look up to Meech, now they look up to me
I am still in my twenties, made twenty mill off the streets
I got a hummer [?] nigga [?]
They get it for 21 and they sell it for 23
All them trips down to Cali, made me wanna stop rapping because these rappers ain't happy, niggas ain't making nothing
A lot of people keep asking, Ralo still in the hood (why)
I am just like my car, I like my trunk in the hood
I like my [?] in the air, I like my money in bundles
Don't give a fuck about effort bitch, we still gon' do numbers
I'm still gon' flex on the gram, show that bitch who I am
Don't you compare me to rappers if they can't buy them a lamb (don't do it)

[Bridge]
Aye don't you compare me to none of these broke ass niggas baby (please don't do that to me)
If the nigga can't buy themself a motherfucking lamb
Then don't compare me to that motherfucking nigga you bitch (don't do that)
I don't give a fuck how much jewelry he got (what else)
I don't give a fuck how many hit records he got (what else)
He still ain't hitting on shit nigga
You know I ain't got no motherfucking fall for no elevator in my motherfucking condo nigga
We buying whole complexes bitch

[Verse 2]
My ears broke, I don't hear none of the hating shit no mo'
Ain't no pressure 'bout a bitch, you can come get your ho
Ain't no pressure on no money, you know we having paper
I hate when niggas don't succeed I ain't your average hater
I always make the money, the money never made 'em
Got hellcats [?] I used to ride a [?]
My baby momma went in labor thinking 'bout child support
I told her only [?] bitches send niggas to court
Don't tell me good luck, just tell me never give up
They ain't wanna give the boy a chance, now they beg me to fuck
Don't ever let the money or fame change who you are
Now 12 get behind me daily 'cause they like the car

[Bridge]
Aye man, aye 12 just pulled me over the other day right (what'd they say)
He ain't ask me for no drivers license or insurance (what they ask you)
He told me "Aye Lil Ralo, that motherfucker clean [?]"
I ask how much money mo- how much money he make a year right (how much he make)
Nigga tell me he make thirty thousand dollars a year (that's it?)
I said excuse me officer I [?], in the glove compartment right now nigga

[Verse 3]
I seen myself on TV, then I said I'm proud of you
This lil niggas selling dope, [?] came out the blue
Everything I do I do that shit [?] for the crew
Every time they see me out on [?]
All them bitches say I'm cute they gon' make me they MCM
They ain't gotta be a fan to know how hard I fuck with them
Even if it rain in [?] there's no [?]

[Outro]
Ralo, Famgoon
