[Intro]
Famerican Gangster

[Verse 1]
I gave the world my story, they act like it was fiction
They talked about my voice, but all the gangsters listened
And every person that I thought was with me went against me
I gave 'em everything I got, they act like I ain't did it
After I taught them how to fight they tried to beat me up
I got more money than that nigga my bitch leave me for
These rappers ain't talkin' 'bout shit but y'all gon' listen to 'em
These niggas doin' more ho shit than these bitches doin'
Tell 'em we never lost a fight, we never lost a battle
These niggas talk behind my back but I don't talk about 'em
Why you keep tryna shine on me when we can shine together
You want to win, you gotta do the shit the bosses tell you
I would never tell you wrong, we don't talk on them telephones
I took care all my partners, but I'm the nigga they tellin' on
I picked 'em up when they was down, they never gave me shit
I was focused on saving money, I couldn't save a bitch

[Chorus]
We ain't gon' never let them folks tear down what we built
Before I ever cross my niggas I'd rather jump off a cliff
I won't never go against them, I won't put no ho over them
I won't never go against them, I won't put no ho over them, no
(We ain't gon' never let them folks tear down what we built)
Don't let 'em do it shawty
You know we built this shit from the ground up nigga
(We ain't gon' never let them folks tear down what we built)
We ain't gon' do it
Hold up, let me tell 'em 'bout these niggas though

[Verse 2]
I used to look up to them niggas, now all them niggas look up to me
We gon' shoot that bitch up any day that they come fuck with me
These niggas know what's up with me
And they know not to fuck with me
I believe like a butterfly, I sting 'em like a bumble bee
Whoever told you I was stoppin', bro they lied to you
Before we let this shit here go you know I lied to you
How the fuck you let them tears come out a real nigga
If he had your back then you know you 'posed to be still with him
Stop telling people you don't want him, man you want him bad
Some times to get to where you're going you gotta go through that
Don't let 'em tell you you can't do it, don't let 'em hold you back
You can be bigger than these niggas, Ralo told you that
Pin it on you, it's easy, they just making it hard
I'm tryna put it together, they wanna break it apart
I'm tryna figure it out, they take me serious now
Take time to hear me out, they take time to hear me out, yeah

[Chorus]
We ain't gon' never let them folks tear down what we built
Before I ever cross my niggas I'd rather jump off a cliff
I won't never go against them, I won't put no ho over them
I won't never go against them, I won't put no ho over them, no
(We ain't gon' never let them folks tear down what we built)
Don't let 'em do it shawty
You know we built this shit from the ground up nigga
(We ain't gon' never let them folks tear down what we built)
We ain't gon' do it, we ain't gon' do it, no
