[Hook]
I made a thousand dollars about a thousand times
I buy my bitch shit all the time
If she need something she can call my line
All I think about is dollar signs
I was looking like a bankroll
Count money till the bank closed
Take a bath, brush my teeth
Hit the trap with the same clothes

[Verse 1]
Where you going I'm on a money mission
I'm a father taking care of business
Pay your bills, pay attention
Never talk, just sit back and listen
Do your time never do the snitching
Fake niggas got so much against me
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a damn
I don't care man a nigga winning
Tell him fuck em on another note
I keep the choppa in the double coat
I buy myself anything I want
What the fuck you think I hustle for?
My bitch fine i keep her looking good
Every time we gotta do the uhhh
Every time we gotta do the nasty
And every time the girl call me daddy

[Interlude]
(When she call my phone she be like "Aye daddy whatu doing daddy?" I told her "Baby I'm on the way home to Momma"
Man she right for me, she know she is. Ha ha yeah uh)

[Verse 2]
I made a thousand dollars about a thousand times
I buy my bitch shit all the time
If she need something she can call my line
All i think about is dollar signs, i was looking like a bankroll
Count money till the bank closed
Take a bath, brush my teeth
Hit the trap with the same clothes
Whatchu doing bitch? I'm doing fine
All my niggas taking care of mine
If i ain't got it ima go and get it
I was fucked up for a minute
I was fucked up they ain't give me shit
I ain't ask them for their opinion
I know some people that down with me
That's why they moving then pounds with me
I made 20 million off of dog food
I got more money than y'all do
That's why when I look at your favorite rapper
I say that nigga a small dude
He a big dog to y'all niggas
But y'all big dogs to small niggas
I know rappers looking up to me
And I ain't never been a tall nigga

[Hook]
I made a thousand dollars about a thousand times

I made a thousand dollars about a thousand times
