[Intro]
Twysted Genius
Ahk shit, pop shit (yeah)
Ahk shit, pop shit (yeah)
Ahk shit, pop shit (yeah)
Ahk shit, pop shit (yeah)
Ahk shit, pop shit (yeah)
Ahk shit, pop shit (yeah)

[Chorus]
What's happening, what popping, what flag is you rocking
Them haters can't get it, they mad 'cause I got it
It's a lot to know 'bout me, you can ask your ho 'bout it
I ain't scared of nobody, even 12 can't stop me
Ahk shit, pop shit
12 can't stop shit
Ahk shit, pop shit
12 can't stop shit
Ahk shit, pop shit
12 can't stop shit
Ahk shit, pop shit
12 can't stop shit

[Verse 1]
Please name one bitch I cannot hit
Lemme pop my shit, I own my own 'partments
Gucci ain't 'bout this, Gucci ain't 'bout that
I ain't saying he wouldn't do it for me, but I got my own check
Put myself on my own jet, put a half a million on the desk
People telling me to keep it low, all a nigga like to do is flex
Hellcats to the convicts, got the lambo in the projects
Thinkin' 'bout what to buy next, I ain't really satisfied yet
I ain't really satisfied yet, I ain't really satisfied yet
Yeah, you can't name a nigga that try me that I ain't try to kill
Every nigga standing beside me did it without a deal, for real

[Chorus]
What's happening, what popping, what flag is you rocking
Them haters can't get it, they mad 'cause I got it
It's a lot to know 'bout me, you can ask your ho 'bout it
I ain't scared of nobody, even 12 can't stop me
Ahk shit, pop shit
12 can't stop shit
Ahk shit, pop shit
12 can't stop shit
Ahk shit, pop shit
12 can't stop shit
Ahk shit, pop shit
12 can't stop shit

[Verse 2]
What the hell is you mad for, why in the hell is you mad
I went and ran up a bag, I refuse to be a liar
Never talk 'bout my past, I'm looking forward never back
Don't ever ask me where I'm at, I'm still tryna get it back
We don't fuck with the police, you a police, you a rat
In the trunk for four weeks, no sleep with a pack
I'm just tryna get it off, put some food in the house
My baby momma been struggling, I ain't tryna hear her mouth

[Bridge]
When I say fuck 12 you say fuck 'em
When I say fuck 12 you say fuck 'em
Fuck 12 (fuck 'em)
Fuck 12 (fuck 'em)
Fuck 12 (fuck 'em)
Fuck 12 (fuck 'em)

[Chorus]
What's happening, what popping, what flag is you rocking
Them haters can't get it, they mad 'cause I got it
It's a lot to know 'bout me, you can ask your ho 'bout it
I ain't scared of nobody, even 12 can't stop me
Ahk shit, pop shit
12 can't stop shit
Ahk shit, pop shit
12 can't stop shit
Ahk shit, pop shit
12 can't stop shit
Ahk shit, pop shit
12 can't stop shit

[Outro]
When I say fuck 12 you say fuck 'em, when I say fuck 12 you say fuck 'em
Fuck 12 (fuck 'em)
Fuck 12 (fuck 'em)
Fuck 12 (fuck 'em)
Fuck 12 (fuck 'em)
