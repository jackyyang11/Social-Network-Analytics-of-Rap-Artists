[Chorus]
Put your hands up like your under arrest, I won't shoot ya
I ain't got a badge on my chest, twisting up a blunt coz I come from the west
She cumming on my dick coz I fuck her the best
I'm on it late night thinking of a plot, take the money from the raps
Put it in the pot, flip it on the waist so I get it on the spot
Yeah I used to have a little now I'm thinking bout a yacht
Copped a whole boat let my crew get a few
My crew gotta eat, coz my crew got a crew
My crew gotta eat, coz my crew got a crew
My crew gotta eat, coz my crew got a crew

[Verse 1]
Coming from the hills I got the streets on lock
Rolling with my cousing keep that heat on cock
[?] gotta bake that bread, fucking with my butter, put a slice on your head
I ain't even really trynna talk no shit, but I'm feeling like the fucking world ultimate
She be getting louder the deeper I get
Daddy long stroke when I'm making a hit
Like bara bing bara boong bara bang, feeling like Ghostface when I let my chain swang
All about the peace I just wanna maintain
Get my family outta jail even if they in a gang
Baby looking good I'm trynna scratch that itch
Put it in her belly till it makes her twitch
Online with the pine hope the net don't glitch
Sliding through your hood I know your set won't trip
Riding down the block with my hand on my sack
You know I keep it on deck
Everbody want the cash [?] homies trynna [?]
They ain't thinking pay checks
You can blow up if you wanna
You can blow up if you like
Lifes about the commas do you the dollars or do you want the stripes
We the type of hustlers getting money every night
Walk up in the party turn it to a bar fight
You don't wanna battle with me nigga please
Your rap style comparable to sardines
Wouldn't fuck with it if I'm starving and didn't have nothing to eat
You couldn't come with it if it's raw dog and it's pussy and she begging you please
That west coast really getting chilly when the pistol packing
No nigga [?] cracking while we dressing in the latest fashion

[Chorus]
Put your hands up like your under arrest, I won't shoot ya
I ain't got a badge on my chest, twisting up a blunt coz I come from the west
She cumming on my dick coz I fuck her the best
I'm on it late night thinking of a plot, take the money from the raps
Put it in the pot, flip it on the waist so I get it on the spot
Yeah I used to have a little now I'm thinking bout a yacht
Copped a whole boat let my crew get a few
My crew gotta eat, coz my crew got a crew
My crew gotta eat, coz my crew got a crew said
My crew gotta eat, coz my crew got a crew

[Outro]
You can blow up if you wanna
You can blow up if you like
Lifes about the commas do you want some dollars or is out trynna get some stripes
Is you out fucking up your life
Said is you out fucking up your life
One chance
