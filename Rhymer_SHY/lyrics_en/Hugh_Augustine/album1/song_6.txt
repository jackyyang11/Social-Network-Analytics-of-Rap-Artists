[Verse 1]
Trunk full of work and some product on the way
Damn used to sell inside access, herby had the grams
Back when Travis Porter had your daughter getting slaughtered
I was moving quarter by the corners trynna fill a void
Got a couple cousins who would murder my opponents
But when we had that falling out, I felt like they was loaded
I felt like they ain't really understand how it was going
Coz my [?] ain't [?] and it's been six summers
Wish that I could change the way I lived when I was younger
Selling og low key doing numbers
Had my own plug wasn't worried bout no drama
Breaking down a pound a week and I ain't chase vagina
I was driving round the city collecting them bank notes
Trynna get some money like them pale white folks
I was too scary so I never sold coke

[Chorus]
Rappers got deals and they still be broke
Yeah they still be broke
Rappers got deals and they still be broke
Driving round the city collecting them bank notes
But I was too scary so I never sold coke

Niggas still be broke
Rappers got deals and they still be broke
Driving round the city collecting them bank notes
But I was too scary so I never sold coke

[Verse 2]
No I never sold the cocaiana, I was living uptown [?] waters [?] post katrina
It was me and [?] we was wiling we was hanging
Then he turned into Frank Lucas, I ain't talking entertainment
Now when I'm out in LA we in Aces sipping Aces
[?] got the money switching faces
All of my homies look at tragedy and never face it
Bleeding on the pavement, fighting the undertaker
[?] couldn't touch the money maker
Back in '04 had the blue [?]
I'm a fourth quarter big baller shot taker
But LA ain't the same since Shaq left the lakers
My lil homie Ty sold crack out the cameo
[?] hanging from the shoreline he was banging
Brother got killed and his mama from [?]
He was seventeen caught a murder, it's a wrap

[Chorus]
Yeah they still be broke
Rappers got deals and they still be broke
Driving round the city collecting them bank notes
But I was too scary so I never sold coke

Niggas still be broke
Rappers got deals and they still be broke
Driving round the city collecting them bank notes
But I was too scary so I never sold coke
