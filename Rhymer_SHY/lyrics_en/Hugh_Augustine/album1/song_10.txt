{Chorus}
Every morning is the same thang
Do my hair, and I brush my teeth
Take a shit, and I roll some weed
Smoke that gimme somethin' to eat

Every night is the same thang
Long day, gotta count my G's
Kick back, now I'm tryna think
Which girl am I tryna please?

Every morning is the same thang
Do my hair, and I brush my teeth
Take a shit, and I roll some weed
Smoke that gimme somethin' to eat

And every night is the same thang
Long day, gotta count my G's
Kick back, now I'm tryna think
Which girl am I tryna please?

{Verse 1}
I was writing songs in my homeroom
Cause all I really wanted was my own room
Now I'm on tour with the whole crew
Bring your home girls, they could roll too
We got our own bus, with the red lights
Push button, doors close, and they airtight
New city, same clothes on a different night
Tell the promoters we showin' up if the money right
(yeah) I just want the cash till it can't fold
I could count a hundred with a blindfold
Still ain't with the label, but I ain't trippin'
Cause everything I'm gettin', I ain't spittin'
Like it brand new, I wanna cut the ribbon
When I pull, see the paint drippin'
I'm in another lane that you ain't drive in
I'm in another spot that you can't get in
Floatin' on a beat like I'm hang-gliding
Turn the lights down, and this bitch vibrant
Real diamonds, so they still shining
Make a hater player wanna get violent

Smokin' in the club
I don't follow rules
Fuckin' on the beach
Still wearing shoes

{Chorus}
Every morning is the same thang
Do my hair, and I brush my teeth
Take a shit, and I roll some weed
Smoke that gimme somethin' to eat

Every night is the same thang
Long day, gotta count my G's
Kick back, now I'm tryna think
Which girl am I tryna please?

Every morning is the same thang
Do my hair, and I brush my teeth
Take a shit, and I roll some weed
Smoke that gimme somethin' to eat

And every night is the same thang
Long day, gotta count my G's
Kick back, now I'm tryna think
Which girl am I tryna please?

Came from the liquor store
Gotta baggie full of dro
And my phone full of women
I wonder who gon' do the most?

{Verse 2}
I deserve, to get some good head
Like the president
I deserve, to line my pockets full
Of dead presidents
Buggin' out, I'm just tryna set
A new precedent
Keep it real, for all the OGs
And the veterans

When I got popped, wasn't even twenty-one
(yeah) I was out on Long Beach, but he didn't even bang twenty-one
(yeah) Three shots, close range, three steps, man, I couldn't even run
Now I'm back on my daily routine, all I do is have fun (have fun)

{Chorus}
Every morning is the same thang
Do my hair, and I brush my teeth
Take a shit, and I roll some weed
Smoke that gimme somethin' to eat

Every night is the same thang
Long day, gotta count my G's
Kick back, now I'm tryna think
Which girl am I tryna please?

Every morning is the same thang
Do my hair, and I brush my teeth
Take a shit, and I roll some weed
Smoke that gimme somethin' to eat

And every night is the same thang
Long day, gotta count my G's
Kick back, now I'm tryna think
Which girl am I tryna please?

Came from the liquor store
Gotta baggie full of dro
And my phone full of women
I wonder who gon' do the most?
