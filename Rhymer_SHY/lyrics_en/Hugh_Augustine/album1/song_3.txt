[Verse 1]
I walk up in your spot I'm leaving with my hands full
Your bitch top me off she leaving with a mouth full
I'm the type that's always looking at the glass full
I'm the type to count my blessings I'm so thankful

Straight up out the city, flipping packs it's regular
If you need it quickly hit me on my cellular
I know some niggas hate coz I'm just too non chalant
But they ain't never been cruising out in [?]
Catch me in a seven fifty in the fast lane
Bitch told me she loved when she see the cash came
But how you rolling with me, you ain't got no passport
Wasn't with me back when all I had was transport
Now they know my size when I walk up in the store
You should see her eyes when them singles hit the floor
Pulling down her panties we ain't even reach the door
Show me all she got to offer, told her gimme more

[Chorus]
You ain't really bout it, you just fronting for the camera
You don't really want it nigga hit you with the hammer
Plotting all summer now I'm waiting for the come up
Twenties fifties hundreds yeah I'm waiting for the counter

You ain't really bout it, you just fronting for the camera
You don't really want it nigga hit you with the hammer
Plotting all summer now I'm waiting for the come up
Twenties fifties hundreds yeah I'm waiting for the counter

Lil nigga why you playing, you know this a mans sport
You know I got the aim shooting from the half court
I said it was a [?] couple grams short
I smoke about a ounce, crumbs on the dashboard
I just hit a lick and now I'm on the move
Said he got a plug and he gon introduce me
Said he got the work and I'm the one to stretch it
Said he got a play and I'm the one to catch it
I wonder if it's talking if it's all a set up
Should I go by myself or should I call the fellas
But I been riding solo, I've been on my own shit
If it's that funny business, hit em with the chrome quick
[?] since I was young, she fucked me [?]
Said she was coming in it [?] we should get back
I ain't the type of playa who be working backwards
The way she sucked my dick she probably get my passwords
Hit it from the back and tell her switch up the position
You only fucking with me for the facial recognition
See me on the stage then she wanted my attention
When you on the stage that's when we go on intermission

[Chorus]
You ain't really bout it, you just fronting for the camera
You don't really want it nigga hit you with the hammer
Plotting all summer now I'm waiting for the come up
Twenties fifties hundreds yeah I'm waiting for the counter

You ain't really bout it, you just fronting for the camera
You don't really want it nigga hit you with the hammer
Plotting all summer now I'm waiting for the come up
Twenties fifties hundreds yeah I'm waiting for the counter

I walk up in your spot I'm leaving with my hands full
Your bitch top me off she leaving with a mouth full
I'm the type that's always looking at the glass full
I'm the type to count my blessings I'm so thankful
