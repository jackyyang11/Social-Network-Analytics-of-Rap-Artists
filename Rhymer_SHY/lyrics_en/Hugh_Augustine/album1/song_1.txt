[Chorus]
I know you was made for me, I know I was made for that
I know that it's sacred, can I get a taste of it
I know you was made for me, I know I was made for it
I know that it's sacred, can I get a taste of it

[Verse 1]
She don't wanna ge objectified no more, she don't wanna be the topic of your convo
She just wanna be electrified with the flow
[?] on my face like [?]
[?] on the street, she don't wanna hear that
Sexual harassment she don't wanna fear that
I ain't trynna act like my shit don't stink, but she don't wanna hear about what these rappers think
Coz they don't care about your patriarchal standards, better learn some manners
Got to find some balance, coz man making money
But women making money too and she can raise the babies by herself so what she need from you
If it isn't support and protection using women just to take out your aggression
Trynna add another notch to your collection
I think as men we need a new perspective

[Chorus]
I know you was made for me, I know I was made for that
I know that it's sacred, can I get a taste of it
I know you was made for me, I know I was made for it
I know that it's sacred, can I get a taste of it

[Verse 2]
She don't wanna be treated like a posession
Don't deserve to be second class citizen
She can fix the world if she won elections
Coz she a black queen homie ain't no question
When we talk about our women we shouldn't generalize them
Calling women bitches just to dehumanise them
Programming the children and desensitise them
But a lot of women taking care of men where I'm from
Like damn, I know my momma raised me up better
Like damn, I know my granny raised me up better
Call that bitch a hoe but man that bitch is my sister
And I know these woman tired of all these fuck niggas
Keep hearing bout how these rappers the greate
Beating em up on camera, drugging and raping em
I'ma speak the motherfucking truth dog
Claiming you a real man [?] in the booth dog


[Chorus]
I know you was made for me, I know I was made for that
I know that it's sacred, can I get a taste of it
I know you was made for me, I know I was made for it
I know that it's sacred, can I get a taste of it

[Verse 3]
You know it's really hard being black in America
You know it's really hard being black over seas
You it's even harder when you living as a woman
Raising up the children [?] she don't  need
Can't even imagine what my mom's sacrificed
Can't even imagine what my aunt sacrificed
So we can have it nice
Just so we can have it nice
And I ain't even really wanna be a doctor
Or a lawyer or a doughnut eating copper
Coz I be rocking mic's and yeah my mom she understood
She told me son, go blow and uplift the neighbourhood
So many people oppressed so I'ma be
Fighting with the words [?]
Yeah I couldn't do it without you
So I had to make a song about you
