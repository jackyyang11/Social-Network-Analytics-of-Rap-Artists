[Intro: Hugh Augustine]
Nice to know you
It was nice to know you, nice to know you
It's Hughy, yeah, ah

[Verse 1: Hugh Augustine]
I was out in Uptown crawlin' like an alligator
That's where I had my first love maker, heartbreaker
I could tell she was the one, she could tell I was a player
Can't spend my days convincing, baby girl I'll see you later
No no no girl, not tonight, I need some time to think
Reminiscing all these memories, I need a drink
It's more than physical, I never felt a spiritual connection
But I keep holding on, it starts to hinder my progression

[Pre-Chorus: Hugh Augustine]
The only way to go is up from here, I thought I told you
Tryna get on my team, you gotta let me coach you
Tell me what's on your mind, it's better when you vocal
But all that silent treatment, damn it was nice to know you
Nice to know you

[Chorus: Hugh Augustine]
Nice to know you, it was nice to know you
I won't tell your secrets, I'm the only one who know you
Nice to know you, it was nice to know you
I won't tell your secrets, I'm the only one who know you
Nice to know you, it was nice to know you
Nice to know you, it was nice to know you
Nice to know you, it was nice to know you
I won't tell your secrets, I'm the only one who knows you, damn

[Verse 2: Hugh Augustine]
Look, I be out in LA, payday on the dial
All I want to do is get paid and act wild
Do another show then smoke a quarter pound
Hurry, tell the venue bring my money right now
Young and single, you can catch me on the scene, I'm in the mix
'Cause I was bein' loyal, she was playin' tricks
I know life's a gamble, watch me throw it when I roll the dice
I ain't got too much to lose, this type of vice ain't nothin' nice

[Pre-Chorus: Hugh Augustine]
The only way to go is up from here, I thought I told you
Tryna get on my team, you gotta let me coach you
Tell me what's on your mind, it's better when you vocal
But all that silent treatment, damn it was nice to know you

[Chorus: Hugh Augustine]
Nice to know you, it was nice to know you
I won't tell your secrets, I'm the only one who know you
Nice to know you, it was nice to know you
I won't tell your secrets, I'm the only one who know you
Nice to know you, it was nice to know you
Nice to know you, it was nice to know you
Nice to know you, it was nice to know you
I won't tell your secrets, I'm the only one who knows you, damn

[Verse 3: Ye Ali]
I know you can't keep a secret
If we drop a sextape, you might leak the teaser
When it come to all these other hoes I catch amnesia
When you get on top and my adreniline increasin'
Let me be the one, I'll be that guy
I could be your main bitch if you need somethin' on the side
You decide, hit my line if you wanna vibe and get high
But if you stuck up then good bye

[Chorus: Hugh Augustine]
Nice to know you, it was nice to know you
I won't tell your secrets, I'm the only one who know you
Nice to know you, it was nice to know you
I won't tell your secrets, I'm the only one who know you
Nice to know you, it was nice to know you
Nice to know you, it was nice to know you
Nice to know you, it was nice to know you
I won't tell your secrets, I'm the only one who knows you, damn
