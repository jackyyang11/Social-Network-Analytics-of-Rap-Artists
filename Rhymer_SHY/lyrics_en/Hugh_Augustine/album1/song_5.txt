[Chorus]
I want the commas from the right to the left
Run it up till I run outta breath
The type of homie who could fuck up a cheque
I'm getting paid coz they pay me respect

[Verse]
Don't step to me I might [?]
You know I still I got my old grandmama gun
She had the wood stock on the shawty straight pump
Yeah there ain't no coming back when it's done
That's the kinda thoughts I had when I was young
Just a little high head trynna have fun
Pissing in the pot thinking that I was the one
He was trynna inspire I was [?] fire
Hanging with gang members, couple [?] expire
Shit, one of my friends in the pen for life
I feel guilty that I still ain't write
Like what should I say, it's been so much time
And I even got the address, my girl told me don't stress
Just worry bout the assets
But she a product of this poison and so am I
I'm getting duckets out the bucket, fuck it, do or die
That's how it is when you grow up here
Plenty people move to LA trynna come up here
But you ain't with the business don't come out here
A lot of people [?] coz it's sunny all year
Yeah I hope you got the [?] deal with it
In the cut you know I'm working on a meal ticket
Smoking blunts, sipping henny, baby keep digging
I can tell that you real with it

[Chorus]
I want the commas from the right to the left
Run it up till I run outta breath
The type of homie who could fuck up a cheque
I'm getting paid coz they pay me respect

I want the commas from the right to the left
Run it up till I run outta breath
The type of homie who could fuck up a cheque
I'm getting paid coz they pay me respect
