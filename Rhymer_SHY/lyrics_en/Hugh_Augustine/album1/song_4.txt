[Chorus]
Where the fuck we going, I ain't even know it
Got a pocket full of money and my homies do too
I've been on a Boeing with a pocket full of shut your mouth
Don't talk so loud, my weed be throwing tantrums like a fucking child
Pass the bag to rory tell him hurry better tuck and roll
We've been getting faded feel the power when I lose control

[Verse 1]
I be so sedated call my girl up she gon suck my soul
She be with the function seven days a week we getting blown
Ah shit I be feeling rich with my pockets full
When my stomach full I need another lick another [?]
[?] I'm her junior, yeah she so mature
Find me out in [?] I was balling just like [?]
Treat me like a king come and fuck me till I fall asleep
Cheating on her man coz her man is a fan of me
I know she care for me I can tell the way she swallow me
I don't even dream coz I'm living out my fantasy

[Chorus]
West side playas getting paid that's a given
In the club with the women and the drugs wearing denim
West side where we smoking dope like a chimney
All my homies balling, all my homies with me like


[Verse 2]
Where we going I ain't even knowing I don't even care
They lost my luggage fuck it get some extra socks and underwear
[?] my own budget we ain't eating no Mc'Donalds here
All I want is head up in the bed don't need no condoms here
Yeah yeah yeah huh follow my nose where ever it goes
My new girl [?] she touching her toes, none of you niggas is touching my flows
Pass it to rory he tuck it and roll
[?] don't fuck with the blow
[?] with a hoe that's for sure
She be going dumb she tell me when to go

[Chorus]
West side playas getting paid it's a given
In the club with the women and the drugs wearing denim
West side where we smoking dope like a chimney
All my homies balling, all my homies with me like
Where the fuck we going I ain't even knowing got a pocket full of money
And my homies do too
I've been on a [?] with a pocket full of shut your mouth yeah uh
Pass the bag to rory tell him hurry better tuck and roll
We be getting faded feel the power when I lose control
