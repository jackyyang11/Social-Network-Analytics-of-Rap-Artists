[Chorus]
Take off your shoes in my house, I got no shake in my ounce
All of my beats got a bounce, I don't rap if it don't bounce
None of my checks finna bounce,none of my checks finna bounce
We could go a couple rounds, fuck me now I gotta bounce
Fuck me now I gotta go, take another trip, do another show
Yeah you know I love it when you ride it slow, cashing another check
Then I gotta go
None of my checks finna bounce,none of my checks finna bounce
We could go a couple rounds, fuck me now I gotta bounce

[Verse 1]
I get it when I deposit, treat my label like a fossit
I'ma bleed em till they nauseous, all these rappers getting tortured
I know the game need changing, you ain't seen what I'm facing
Everything I got was taken, big blue ben franklins
I'm a villain in the making, all my weapons out of make shift
I can show you how to shape shift, all you really need is patience
Break it down like a weight lift
That's my form my occupation, only dabble with the trees man
I ain't fucking with the caitlen
I get it when I deposit, I get it when I deposit
I get it when I deposit, I get it when I deposit

[Chorus]
Take off your shoes in my house, I got no shake in my ounce
All of my beats got a bounce, I don't rap if it don't bounce
None of my checks finna bounce,none of my checks finna bounce
We could go a couple rounds, fuck me now I gotta bounce
Fuck me now I gotta go, take another trip, do another show
Yeah you know I love it when you ride it slow, cashing another check
Then I gotta go
None of my checks finna bounce,none of my checks finna bounce
We could go a couple rounds, fuck me now I gotta bounce

[Verse 2]
Got a plug from the bay, same day flip get the money now
Know they hate it when the seasons change
Vacuum seal, I ain't feel the drought
Back to life got a couple saved, the label made you in the microwave
I will rather get it on my own, corporation treat you like a slave
If you ain't pay for that table, why you standing on the couches
Now you really looking like a hoe, do anything for the clout bitch
Put some money where your mouth is, got a [?]
You ain't really, really, really, really really, really, really,really
Bout this

[Chorus]
Take off your shoes in my house, I got no shake in my ounce
All of my beats got a bounce, I don't rap if it don't bounce
None of my checks finna bounce,none of my checks finna bounce
We could go a couple rounds, fuck me now I gotta bounce
Fuck me now I gotta go, take another trip, do another show
Yeah you know I love it when you ride it slow, cashing another check
Then I gotta go
None of my checks finna bounce,none of my checks finna bounce
We could go a couple rounds, baby fuck me now I gotta bounce

I get it when I deposit, I get it when I deposit
I get it when I deposit, I get it when I deposit
I get it when I deposit, I get it when I deposit
I get it when I deposit, I get it when I deposit

[Chorus]
Take off your shoes in my house, I got no shake in my ounce
All of my beats got a bounce, I don't rap if it don't bounce
