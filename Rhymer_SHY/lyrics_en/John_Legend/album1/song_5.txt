What would I do without your moist beef?
Tender, bone-in, and you in my teeth
You got me slobbering, no kidding, I can taste you now
What's going on, are you medium-rare?
I'm down for a magical meat affair
And I'm so hungry, don't know what "no" means, but I'll be a good boy

My mouth's making water
But I'm seeing fine
You're prime cut, and I'm out of my mind

Cause all of meat
I would love to chew
Love your chuck, and rib and brisket
Even your shank and flank, I'll take it
Give me all your meat
I'll give my gnaw to you
From your tongue down to your trimmings
Even your bones that get me digging
Cause I could eat all of meat
If you give me all to chew, oh

Give me all to chew
Meat's on the counter, we're both hickory smoked
Meat and potatoes, potato is me

I could eat all of meat
If you give me all to chew, oh
