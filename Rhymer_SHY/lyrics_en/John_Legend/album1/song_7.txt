[Verse 1: John Legend & Jennifer Nettles]
What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawing me in and you kicking me out
You got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
What's going on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be all right

[Pre-Hook: John Legend and Jennifer Nettles]
My head's under water but I知 breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

[Hook: John Legend & Jennifer Nettles]
Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges both
All your perfect imperfections both
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I知 winning
Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you

[Verse 2: John Legend & Jennifer Nettles, Both]
How many times do I have to tell you?
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too
The world is beating you down, I知 around
Through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing in my head for you

[Hook: John Legend & Jennifer Nettles]
My head's under water but I知 breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

[Hook: John Legend & Jennifer Nettles]
Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I知 winning
Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you

[Bridge: John Legend & Jennifer Nettles]
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
Risking it all, though it痴 hard

[Hook: John Legend & Jennifer Nettles]
Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I知 winning
Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh, of you

[Outro: John Legend & Jennifer Nettles]
I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh, of you
