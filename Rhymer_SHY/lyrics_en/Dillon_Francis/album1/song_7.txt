[Verse 1]
Is it alright if I come round? Is it too late if I come now?
Would you stay up to figure this out some way?
If I stay here would you come back? If I stay cool would you be mad?
Would you want me if I want you that way?

[Chorus]
Cause all I can think about is coming over, coming over
All I can think about is coming over, coming over
All I can think about is coming over, coming over

[Verse 2]
Isn't it strange that every time I look at your name I'm suddenly high?
For you to feel the same I would do almost anything
I'd give away this, give away that, all of my shoes and all of my hats
All I need's you and a bit of music

[Chorus]
Cause all I can think about is coming over, coming over
All I can think about is coming over, coming over
All I can think about is coming over, coming over
Isn't it strange? Isn't it strange?
Isn't it strange? Isn't it strange?
