[Verse 1]
Waiting at the station
Looking with a wide eye, letting the world go by
Headphones on, I make a dedication
Universe, don't look back
I come around the corner
Cleopatra's daughter, daydream come to life
Struck with the feeling
Rolling, wheeling, gliding on ice

[Chorus]
Being with you
I feel drunk all the time
I cannot get you
Get you out of my mind
Got nonsense on my pace
Got to be off my face
Being with you
I feel drunk all the time

[Verse 2]
It's happening again
I thought I had it straight, I thought I knew it all
But all it took
One glance to put my good intentions fall
With you I found the champion sound
The journey through the night
Struck with the feeling
Rolling, wheeling, gliding on ice

[Chorus]
Being with you
I feel drunk all the time
I cannot get you
Get you out of my mind
Got nonsense on my pace
Got to be off my face
Being with you
I feel drunk all the time

[Bridge]
Being with you
I feel drunk all the time
Being with you
I feel drunk all the time
Intoxify
Make my spirits rise
Things we cannot hide
Thinking 'bout you day and night

[Chorus]
Being with you
I feel drunk all the time
I cannot get you
Get you out of my mind
Got nonsense on my pace
Got to be off my face
Being with you
I feel drunk all the time

[Outro]
Being with you
I feel drunk all the time
Being with you
I feel drunk all the time
Being with you
I feel drunk all the time
Being with you
I feel drunk all the time (all the time)
