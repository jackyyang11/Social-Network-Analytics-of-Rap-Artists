[Verse 1]
You're like a part of me that only I can see
You're even with me when I'm all alone
The people stop and stare, they say that no one's there
Maybe we're better when we're on our own

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause they don't know you like I know you
I know they don't
No, they don't
And they won't love you like I love you
I know they won't
No, they won't

[Chorus]
I'll take you anywhere I go
Anywhere
I'll take you anywhere I go
Anywhere
I'll take you anywhere I go
Anywhere
I'll take you anywhere I go
Anywhere

[Verse 2]
You take me to a place, I know I have to face
You show me things that I have never seen
They don't believe in us, in you I have to trust
You make me someone I would not have been

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause they don't know you like I know you
I know they don't
No, they don't
And they won't love you like I love you
I know they won't
No, they won't

[Chorus]
I'll take you anywhere I go
Anywhere
I'll take you anywhere I go
Anywhere
I'll take you anywhere I go
Anywhere
I'll take you anywhere I go
Anywhere
I'll take you anywhere I go
Anywhere
I'll take you anywhere I go
Anywhere
I'll take you anywhere I go
Anywhere
I'll take you anywhere I go
Anywhere

[Outro]
I will take you anywhere
I will take you
I will take you anywhere
I will take you
