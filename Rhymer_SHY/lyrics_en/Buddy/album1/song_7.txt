Should old acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind?
Should old acquaintance be forgot
And auld lang syne?

For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne
We'll take a cup of kindness yet
For auld lang syne, for auld lang syne

10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1!

Old acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind?
Should old acquaintance be forgot
Eh, eh, auld lang syne?

For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne
We’ll take a cup of kindness yet
For auld lang syne

And here's a hand, my trusty friend
And gie's a hand o’ thine
We'll take a cup o' kindness yet
For auld lang syne

For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne
We'll take a cup of kindness yet
For auld lang syne

For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne
We'll take a cup of kindness yet
For auld lang syne
