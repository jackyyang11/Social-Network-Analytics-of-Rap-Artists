[Verse 1]
Jordan 12s for my shoes
BBC to my clothes
Fiji water for my pools
And plus I got Nike socks on my toes
Everywhere that I go
I gots to have my bros
And a couple MILFs for all of my poles
But I don't really care too much about those
I'm talking Mercedes Benz for my whip
G-class would be perfect
Two stacks for my tip
Tell the waitress make it worth it
We never packing that light noise
That's right boys we hurting ya'll
My flow goes all night boys
Make white boys go surfing

[Hook]
Aye bruh
Don't get gassed man
I could be the match to your gas can
Girls on my jock cause they want some, want some more
And they heard that I got that
Nigga that Awesome Awesome...

[Verse 2]
The way I'm swagging on this song
Niggas' scunching they nose
Making they faces like somebody stanking
That's me cause I bring that funk
If you dont think I'm on
You should come see my shows
Gotta couple of MILFs and they trying to get low
But if you finna to drink then I'm bringing my own
And if you trying to get banged on
There's a place you can go
Called Compton, California, my home
West Side, you already know
Couple places that you know you can't go
Got bracelets all on they ankles
They shoot you in the face just for a peso
When they jeans hang low and the fiends stay low

[Hook]
Aye bruh
Don't get gassed man
I could be the match to your gas can
Girls on my jock cause they want some, want some more
And they heard that I got that
Nigga that Awesome Awesome...

(Oh oh oh oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
That That...
Oh oh oh oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
That That...
Oh oh oh oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
That That...)

[Verse 3]
Gangsta niggas from my team
My main girl's bionic
All about my cream
You can see a gushing out of my wallet
Let me tell you something ironic
Seen this girl and her butt was stupid
But the moment she told me she wasn't a fan, was the same moment she blew it
Screw it
Let me tell you how I do it
Here's a banger to prove it
Where the beat go "boom boom boom boom"
Ya'll know ya'll lose it
If you got a small mouth please don’t do it
The homie got a burner and he ain't afraid to use it
Getting money from all of my music
I'm not trying to loop it
I ain't stupid

[Hook]
Aye bruh
Don't get gassed man
I could be the match to your gas can
Girls on my jock cause they want some, want some more
And they heard that I got that
Nigga that Awesome Awesome...

(Oh oh oh oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
That That...
Oh oh oh oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
That That...
Oh oh oh oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
That That...)
