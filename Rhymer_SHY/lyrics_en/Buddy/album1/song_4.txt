[Intro]
I sit on the edge of my seat because when I woke up this morning and began to pray, I say, "God, I know you finna do something great in my life today"

[Intro: Buddy]
Trouble don't last always
Trouble don't last always
Trouble don't last always
Trouble don't last always
Trouble don't last always
Trouble don't last always
Trouble don't last always
Trouble don't last always

[Verse 1: Buddy]
Sick and tired of these bills every month
Made a little money but it ain't enough
Sick and tired of these niggas, God is my witness
No job so they out here robbing and stealing
Sick and tired of being broke, I need a smoke
Done working a 9 to 5, I don't want to go
Sick and tired of the streets, I need to leave
Wish I could just bounce but it ain't cheap
There's gotta be a better way
For me to get paid today
Got to get some money, need to get some money
Can I get some money? Let me get some money
Get the money

[Pre-Chorus: Buddy]
Can I get a witness?
Oh yeah, we from the hood, we ain't going nowhere (Hey)
Can I get a witness?
Oh yeah, still in the hood, we ain't going nowhere (Hey, yeah)
Can I get a witness?
Oh yeah, we from the hood, we ain't going nowhere (Hey)
Can I get a witness?
Oh yeah, still in the hood, we ain't going nowhere (Niggas)

[Chorus: Buddy]
Add it up
So it's a growing process. I'm not what I should be
Add it up
But when I look back on my life, I'm not what I used to be
Add it up
God ain't through with me yet. Anybody in the transformation stages?
Add it up
Anybody being transformed?

[Post-Chorus: Buddy]
I can't do what I want 'cause
I can't just afford to
I ran out of luck, my
Paycheck ain't enough, damn
Been working all week, sleep
I ain't had a week, drink
I need me a fe-ew
My rent almost due

[Verse 2: Buddy]
Broke find broke, we ain't got it
Nothing but lent up in my pocket
Need new kicks but I can't cop it
When we hit the mall, we window shopping
Yeah, what's in yo' wallet?
Say you getting money, well, I can't call it
Why you lying? Nigga, you ain't balling
You broke as I am, you ain't got it
Stop it, stop it
We need that profit, profit
Tryna make that double, double
Because it's never enough

[Pre-Chorus: Buddy]
Can I get a witness?
Oh yeah, we from the hood, we ain't going nowhere (Hey)
Can I get a witness?
Oh yeah, still in the hood, we ain't going nowhere (Hey, yeah)
Can I get a witness?
Oh yeah, we from the hood, we ain't going nowhere (Hey)
Can I get a witness?
Oh yeah, still in the hood, we ain't going nowhere (Niggas)

[Chorus: Buddy]
Add it up
I can't praise Him enough, you can't stop my praise
Add it up
You don't know my story
Add it up
All the things that I've been through. I'm still here
Add it up
Only by the grace of God, I'm still here

[Post-Chorus: Buddy]
I can't do what I want 'cause
I just can't afford to
I ran out of luck, my
Paycheck ain't enough, damn
Been working all week, sleep
I ain't had a week, drink
I need me a fe-ew
My rent almost due

[Outro]
I got more clothes than I can wear
I got more shoes than I can wear
Got stuff I ain't gon' wear no more
Still hanging in the closet, that's just some material stuff
Look at the spiritual blessing
Because God have been too good to me
Have He been good to you?
Come on, give him a praise in the house
