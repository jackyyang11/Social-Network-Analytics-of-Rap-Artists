[Verse 1]
Aye, it's been a long day
"Buddy, can you ease my mind?" what she told me
Now I got her posted up in my domain
And I'm lightin' up the fire with the propane
In the background, listenin' to Cocaine
Friends came through, then we hear the soul train
Sub bass kickin' down the doorframe
'93 baby, listenin' to the Old Daze, Hub City raised me
Notice niggas don't change, do this on the daily
Don't it sound crazy?
Flyin' outta town, can you hear me now, baby?
Be back in the wild, I've been goin' wild lately
Then it's goin' down like one o'clock in the morn'
Cell phone ring ring, so I pick up
Homeboy talkin' 'bout a party we should hit up
First we gotta clean the fit up, peep the getup
Marijuana and the liquor make you hiccup
East Coast, smokin' the la-la-la
Niggas up north came here to vibe tonight
Niggas down south know they wanna get high tonight
B-U-double D, makin' sure that I roll this blunt tight

[Hook]
Huh, now who got a light?
Aye, do you got a light?
Yo, who got a light?
Man, I'm tryna light this blunt
Aye, who got a light?
Yo, do you got a light?
Aye, who got a light
Damn, I'm tryna light this blunt

[Refrain]
OG weed smoke, never no street roll
We smoke the number one kush in a pre-roll
THC on me, I be too gone
You ain't tryna hit my blunt, it's too strong
It's too strong

[Verse 2]
Just another West Coast nigga on the come up
Smokin' on kush, finna roll another blunt up
You could still cut your head up and get wet up
YG says shut up, get your bread up
Back of the Lyft, baby packin' a spliff
She keep talkin' that shit, but I'm not tryna hear it
Headed out to the hills, got a bag full of thrills
Other hand full of bills, yeah we do this for real
All the homegirls makin' sure the hoes act right
All the homeboys rollin' up kush in the back
Come with me baby if you want that pipe
But we finna hotbox, you might catch a contact tonight
Baby, you should let me get inside your life
I could take you to the crib and massage ya right
Let me see your breasts, I won't chastise ya
I could get you wet, baby let me baptize ya
I'm a west side Hub City rider
Rhymin', young nigga smokin' on ganja
Grindin', gettin' to the money, no problem
Dollars, that's the only thing in my pockets

[Hook]
Huh, now who got a light?
Aye, do you got a light?
Yo, who got a light?
Man, I'm tryna light this blunt
Aye, who got a light?
Yo, do you got a light?
Aye, who got a light
Damn, I'm tryna light this blunt

[Refrain]
OG weed smoke, never no street roll
We smoke the number one kush in a pre-roll
THC on me, I be too gone
You ain't tryna hit my blunt, it's too strong
It's too strong
THC on me, I be too gone
You ain't tryna hit my blunt, it's too strong

[Outro]
Aye, aye, you got a lighter, dog?
Oh my god, thank you so much, wow, finally
The number one kush, the number one kush
The number one kush, the number one kush
The number one kush
The number one kush
