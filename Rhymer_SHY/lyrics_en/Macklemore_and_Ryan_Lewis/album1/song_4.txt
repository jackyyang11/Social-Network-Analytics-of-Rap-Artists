[Verse]
Standing outside that venue, passing out fliers
No record labels calling, no buzz, no fire
Burning in my lungs if I kept on writing
One day I'll be discovered and somebody might sign him
Naw, naw, now saying that I'm pop [?]
Before I was on anybody else's iPod
Sleeping on couches and praying to my God
I'm making that money to eat at a IHOP
Give me twenty people, turn them into believers
Booked my own shows in two-hundred-seat theaters
Searched my whole life on this podium, I speak for my hard work
I deserve this arena
When you work your whole life on the verge of defeated
Do it for yourself because nobody out there believed it
Record label, naw, we show the world you don't need 'em
The people want to see change, I so happen to speak it
And me, I'm like, "Who are you?"
God damn it, I'm myself, and I know the truth
And I released that shit when I was in the booth
Shoutout to my family in Syracuse

[Hook]
Everybody say oh-oh! (Oh-oh!)
Say oh-oh! (Oh-oh!)
Say oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh! (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh!)
Say oh-oh, oh-oh! (Oh-oh, oh-oh!)
Say oh-oh, oh-oh! (Oh-oh, oh-oh!)

[Outro]
It goes, "Make the money, don't let the money make you
Change the game, don't let the game change you
I'll forever remain faithful
All my people say true," I said
"Make the money, don't let the money make you
Change the game, don't let the game change you
I'll forever remain faithful, all my people stay true"
