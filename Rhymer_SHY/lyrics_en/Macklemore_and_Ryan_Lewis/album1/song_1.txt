Wow, we're here on this stage right now.

First and foremost, I want to thank our fans, the people that got us on this stage. Before there was any media, before there was any buzz about us, before there was a story, there was our fans and it spread organically through them so without them there would be no us. Shout out to everybody repping worldwide.

I want to thank my beautiful fiancee, my parents, my manager, and our team that puts together this music, that sacrifices everything for this art. Countless hours in the studio and onstage and everyone that made this album what it is. I love you guys.

And I want to say, we made this album without a record label, we made it independently, and we appreciate all the support.
