[Intro: Biggie]


[Chorus: Duce]

I'm a Outlaw x3


[Verse 1: Duce]

Lyrically gifted
The world I see is different, look closely you'll see my vision
Watch me paint an image with metaphors and precision
Living how I wanna, y'all still caught up in the system
New Slaves, never gunna get away
Afraid to chase their dreams so they die before the grave
Since second grade, been scheming, plotting about getting paid
Made a couple dollars flipping fries off my lunch tray
My mother's still working
Time's are hard, my nigga, my father still hurting
Look up to the sky, ask him why do we deserve this
But if this shit was easy I probably wouldn't put the work in
Uh..
Niggas want to see me fall off
I'm a top dog, riding top down, my shorty got her top off
Niggas claim that they've been balling, but can't even get a shot off
My sawed off's equipped with shit that'll knock your fucking jaw off
I'm a Outlaw


[Chorus: Duce}


[Verse 2:Duce]
Tryna move forward, though it never stops
Can barely walk the block without the chance of getting shot
The only fear I got it losing my mom and pops
Niggas quick to take a life away and see a body drop
So I load my Glock, fuck you if you're judging me
But I'll be damned if my family dies just because of me
Luckily, all these fuck niggas ain't the thugs you see
Quick to turn and sprint when they ain't behind a fuckin screen
This shit is real, shit is real
You either hoop, sell dope, or get a deal
Never been the type of nigga to rob and steal
But I will but the steel to your grill for a fucking bill
Niggas want to see me fall off
I'm a top dog, riding top down, my shorty got her top off
Ima hop out, let it all off, hop back in, take the mask off
This ain't me but at all costs, I'ma get rich or die lost
I'm a Outlaw


[Chorus: Duce]

[Outro: Biggie]
