[Intro]
Im no peter pan
Dont believe in no man
Get it how i can
Can't be me, can't understand

[Chorus]
I got cheap xan songs for big baby ears
What they want is weird but
I won't judge the person
Who out here is so perfect anyway

[Verse 1]
Out here swerving hope i see ya when i steer
Alloy radar app remind you when i'm here on site
Record the grind then poof, im gone like
A nightcrawler, jake gylenhall-type performance
Darko duce, get my guidance from some of ya favorite monsters
Made in the mecca of rap, I dont wanna hit ya bih
Ion wanna sip of lean, but i will hit the gas, pass it
I dont wanna hit a lick, i ain't really into flash
I ain't say its wack, just flawed, as a format
Into open source stacking over false stats
Forced animosity, all an atrocity
We just wanna quick fix for the bb girl with the lips so
We won't do disc skips just mp3 hits

[Chorus]
I got cheap xan songs for big baby's ears
What they want is weird but
I won't judge the person
Who out here is so perfect anyway
I'll wait..............................
I got cheap xan songs for your big baby ears
What she want is weird but
I won't judge the person
Who out here is so perfect anyway

[Verse]
Why stay the same if all it brought is shade
You gotta feel the pain before its entertaining
I dont do lil brains, fake fame or small baller thoughts!
Night time authority just want me to get lost
These laws give em big teeth but they all bark
We not dogs. I brought cameras just to catch ya
Open carry 38 special in case you might  get extra
You might get pension. I might get shot so
Til im up above or an underworld boss
Making it more affordable to sing along with ya daughter

[Chorus]
I make cheap xan songs for big baby ears
What they want is weird but
I won't judge the person
Who out here is so perfect anyway

[Verse]
God give peace to the fallen soldier
Fame or not, you was loved. even if it was just for the moment
Need to speak, hit me up @stickmanii just sat hi or describe your survival, I wanna lie but
When dying feel closer
On late night drives I ain't tryna feel sober
Lady luck always on time with invite knowing just what it feels like to wait til it's over
Im going numb, and can't stop, i suppose
I know im dumb from reality news and new blues
So  with these last words, let me acknowledge that I noticed you and give you a moment of silence, from the big homie duce
