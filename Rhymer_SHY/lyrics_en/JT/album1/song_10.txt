[Intro]
The Overwatch is comin'
Bad guys, you best start runnin'
The Overwatch is comin'
Better pick your side
The Overwatch is comin'
Bad guys, you best start runnin'
The Overwatch is comin'
Heroes never die

You know what? I can't work with this
Lúcio!
What's good?
Drop me a fat beat
Let's jam!

[Winston]
They call me Winston, the gorilla with brains
I don't even know how my glasses fit on my face
If you piss me off, I'll get the final say
Cause I'm a tank, I'll hit you with my Primal Rage
This ain't the jungle, but I'm still a beast
500 HP, you're not killin' me
I'll deploy my shield if I'm in bad shape
Then you better get back, I'm about to go ape!

[Widowmaker]
Your skills aren't quite precise as mine are
You look like a chimp compared to Reinhardt (hey!)
The bigger you are, the bigger the shame
When I show you why I've been given the name
It's the Widowmaker, the finest sniper
Scoping you out with my Recon Visor
They say I'm poisonous, so keep your distance
Unless you want a couple Widow's Kisses

[Chorus]
Overwatch is back in town
If you're not a hero, don't stick around
Jump in the fight, and don't be shy
Cause if you're with us, you know a hero never dies

[McCree]
Quick on the draw, I'm a natural deadeye
Me and my Peacekeeper won't let you get by
Six quick shots and I leave no witness
I'm the one that keeps the undertaker in business
Welcome to the courtroom, I'm the judge
And I won't get justice without my gun
Don't believe me? Come and see yourself
You want proof? Just read the belt

[Reaper]
If you’re the law, then let me break you
Let’s see how long those six shots will take you
When I'm in Wraith Form, they'll go right through
Fear the Reaper, I will unmake you
Don't get near me or my Death Blossom
I'll put you in your coffin without a problem
My shotguns rain hellfire upon you
No matter where you go, death walks among you

[Chorus]
Overwatch is back in town
If you're not a hero, don't stick around
Jump in the fight, and don't be shy
Cause if you're with us, you know a hero never dies

[Bastion]
Thank you for selecting Bastion
Mobilize assault and prepare for action
Submit yourself to robot control
Shift into tank mode and I'm on a roll
Now reconfigure, Sentry Turret
Repair required, just blew a circuit
I'm fascinated by nature's beauty
But human destruction is my rightful duty

[Tracer]
Cheers, love, the cavalry's here
You'll never catch me when I disappear
I'm a gifted girl, I manipulate time,
I'll be out of your sight in the blink of an eye
And I've got two pistols that I'm rather quick with
Did you catch that trick? That was wicked
Don't stop me now, I'm on a spree
I'm the hero you all wish you could be

[Refrain]
The Overwatch is comin'
Bad guys, you best start runnin'
The Overwatch is comin'
Better pick your side
The Overwatch is comin'
Bad guys, you best start runnin'
The Overwatch is comin'
Heroes never die

[Chorus]
Overwatch is back in town
If you're not a hero, don't stick around
Jump in the fight, and don't be shy
Cause if you're with us, you know a hero never dies

[Chorus and Refrain Together]
