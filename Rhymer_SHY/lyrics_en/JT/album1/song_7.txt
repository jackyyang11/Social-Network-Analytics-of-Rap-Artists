[Intro]

I got Overwatch for Christmas
Now all I'm asking for
Is a little something extra
Promise that it's not much more
How am I to play this game
My emotes and skins are lame
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is loot

I'm not very good at this game
All my skins are getting old
Think it's time I get an upgrade
But I don't have any gold
Why can't Santa fill my stocking
With gift cards for Battlenet
I've been playing nice all year long
Even though I'm not the best
I don't win a lot I know
Still want a new victory pose
I'll look good for you
All I want for Christmas is loot
Loot, baby

I won't ask for snow this Christmas
I don't wanna go outside
I would rather keep on gaming
Flaunting all my new voice lines
Mercy, Tracer, Widowmaker
All beneath the mistletoe
Even D.Va will be there waiting
For her darling Lucio
I just want to dance and sing
Leave my spray on everything
You know what to do
All I want for Christmas is loot
Loot, baby

Look at all these highlight intros
So festive everywhere
Every box I get is common
Less often I get rare
But you could make me merry
With a few more legendaries
Baby won't you please, get a little loot for me
Just a few more, that's all, I swear
Let's vacation to Numbani
Russia's way too cold for me
The only Blizzard that I want this year
Is the one on my PC
What more do I have to say
You know how to make my day
I'll squad up with you
All I want for Christmas is loot

[Chorus repeats]
