[Verse 1: Skull]
It's 12AM, you're wide awake-
Your sanity is mine to break
Don't fall asleep, cause it's time to play
Soon it will be your life I take
When it's closing time we come alive to prey-
On any girl or guy left inside the place
I'm a different beast between night and day
You're gonna see a brand new side of me

[Verse 2: Zach Boucher]
Trust me, I can stay up way past six, six
I'm not that surprised I'mma live, live
But don't get much closer, I'm hoping you posers-
Break down when it's over, before you will know it-
I'll split you like Moses, you robots will need some hope-
As I'm still flowing and blowing your circuits-
It's hurtin' right? My security's perfect, I'm living life-
Surviving every night
Got my eye on every door
Power's low, I can't use more...

[Interrupt 1: Skull]
Warming up my rusty joints
Join us now, you have no choice!

[Verse 2 cont: Zach Boucher]
Same routine, night and day
At least I'm the one that's getting paid

[Interrupt 2: Skull]
Cameras live, start the show-
What's that smell? I think you know!
I think you know

[Hook: Skull]
Just get through this and then you'll get your pay
Unless this graveyard shift should put you in your grave
(In your grave)
After hours we both know what's goin' down
Can you make it all the way till 6AM rolls around?

[Zach Boucher]
I'm gonna' beat ya
(I'm gonna' beat ya)

[Skull]
Hope you like pizza

[Zach Boucher]
Ugh, you call this "pizza"?

[Skull]
Bon appetit bruh, you'll never see the end of me

[Zach Boucher]
My camera's up, you can't hide from me

[Skull]
This restaurant won't fit us both

[Both]
Which one of us is gonna' run the show?

[Verse 3: Skull]
Clean your desk, get to packing-
Unless you're an expert at multi-tasking
Complain to HR, they'll all be laughing-
When you say "Animatronics tried to harass me!"
Blow my circuits? You gotta be jokin'-
You cannot break what's already broken
Forget the night shift, you want a promotion?
We've got a spare suit that's currently open!

[Verse 4: Zach Boucher]
Batteries low but that doesn't concern me
You want some water? 'Cause you robots look thirsty
You can try but you won't ever hurt me
You can stuff me in a suit 'cause I know that I'm deserving
Intimidating but you actin' like the bad guy
I'm always hunting you down, check your blind side-
I'm just a normal guy lookin' for a quick fix
You should too 'cause you robots are a bit glitched
I'm a big risk. You can never change this

[Hook: Skull]
Just get through this and then you'll get your pay
Unless this graveyard shift should put you in your grave
(In your grave)
After hours we both know what's goin' down
Can you make it all the way till 6AM rolls around?
I'm gonna' beat ya
(I'm gonna' beat ya)

[Verse 5: Skull]
Have a slab of that crappy pizza-
Sit back relax and just kick your feet up
We're pushing you into overtime-
And that friend of yours on the phone will die
Don't matter how much you prepare-
I've never seen a grown man get so scared
Stay the night, take a chance
Hope you brought a change of pants

[Verse 6: Zach Boucher]
I'm not scared, if anything I'm embarrassed-
Inherit these skills and where the hell are your parents?
They're caring enough, when they left you transparent
You wandered in the dark, in that suit is where you'll perish
Yeah, I'm the Bite of '87-
My brain and thoughts are my weapon-
You ready to learn your lesson?-
Don't ever follow a peasant or stranger into the dark, dark
You'll need repairs when I'm tearing you all apart

[Interrupt 3: Skull]
You really can't be such a man-
If this was the best job that you could land

[Verse 6 cont: Zach Boucher]
You're a bunch of brats who hate adults-
So quit with the petty lame insults
They say this place is made for kids-
Is that a joke? I think it is

[Interrupt 4: Skull]
We'll say goodbye at morning light
Wanna' play again tomorrow night?

[Zach Boucher]
Actually, I'm kinda busy...

[Hook: Skull]
Just get through this and then you'll get your pay
Unless this graveyard shift should put you in your grave
(In your grave)
After hours we both know what's goin' down
Can you make it all the way till 6AM rolls around?
I'm gonna' beat ya
(I'm gonna' beat ya)
