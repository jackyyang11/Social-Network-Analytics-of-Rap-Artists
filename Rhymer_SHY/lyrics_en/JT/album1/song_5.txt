[Verse 1]
Life force on the rise, organisms organize
Situation analyzed, antibodies synthesize
Losing mass, now consume
Active cultures on the move
Liquid, gaseous, solid too
Swallow all your molecules
Cellular mitotic phase, mobilize and oscillate
Subdivide, repopulate
Operation: drop the bass

[Hook]
Agario, oiraga

[Verse 2]
Enter battle, biologic
On my level, microscopic
Break apart, divide and conquer
Multiplyin', interlockin'
Apaparatus, anabolic
Super sizin', catastrophic
Spread the virus, keep it chronic
No remission, never stoppin'
Disengage, fall back
Respawn, bond fast
Now embrace for contact
Subatomic combat

[Hook]
Agario, oiraga

[Verse 3]
Diagnose, speculate
Expected infection rate
Reproduce, replicate
Evolution escalate
Molecular separation, split defenses penetration
No strategic deviation, exponential devastation
Leaderboard, set the score
Ingest every spore
Be the best or get absorbed, Apex Predator

[Hook]
Agario, oiraga

[Verse 4]
Intercelluar invading, germinating propagating
Ubermass oultivating, stabilize dominating
Hypertonic, easy fix
Offspring breeding quick
See the pattern, read the script
Ruler of this petri dish
On your own, starting slow
Move as one and far we go
Hyper mitochondrial, super status - Mario
Spread genetic army growth, deoxyribo party zone
What's the purpose, hardly know
Welcome to Agario
