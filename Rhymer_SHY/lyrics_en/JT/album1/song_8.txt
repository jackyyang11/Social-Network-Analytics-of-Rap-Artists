(Intro)
Uhhh I don't really know how to say this but I'll give it a shot...

(Verse 1)
Your the legs to my table you're the cream cheese to my everything bagel if I was a tv you would be more than just the basic cable what's an organic grass-fed chicken breast without its label your the warm-up set to my workout your the iron smoothing every single wrinkle in my shirt out you're the light making sure I never ever burn out your the moral support for a horrible turn out

(Chorus)
Your more than just a ball and chain your part of me I hope I've made that clear with all these analogies bear with me have a little patience I'm tryna think of all the ways that I say this we go together better than Friday-Saturday I'll make this easy for you with more analogies just like the moonlight would be gone without the sun I'm not even myself without your love (without your love)

With out your love

(Verse 2)
If you ever think of leavin me then I'll pray you don't your like the covalent bond to my H2O like a beautiful landscape with no one to see it what is a God among men with his Venus? I'd be like Adam Sandler with out the funny (ugh) what is a republican without a ton of money? Just like Amy wine house with out the drugs in case you couldn't tell I'm not myself with out your love

(Chorus)
Your more than just a ball and chain your part of me I hope I've made that clear with all these analogies I'm tryin my best to be original and I'm not running short on similes and metaphors we go together better then steak and Cabernet I'm getting really clever with these analogies would Kim Kardashian be hot with out her butt? I'm not even myself with out your love (without your love)

Without your love

(Verse 3)
What's a fire hydrant with out a fire truck? If I'm an alcoholic then your my Irish pub okay that last comparison might've gone kinda far you can call me jack Johnson that makes you my guitar if I was lance Armstrong you'd be my Tour de France you'd also be my steroids and the single testical that's in my pants (ooooh) better stop with the controversial topics don't want to get sued if I got in trouble for this song id have to put the blame on you!!

(Chorus)
Cuz your not just a ball and chain your part of me I hope I've made that clear with all these analogies id like to show you what you mean to me what's an expensive restaurant without the scenery? Your presence is so soothing like minty aftershave how long can I keep this going with these analogies a whopper wouldn't be the same without the bun I'm not even myself with out your love (without your love)

Without your love

(Verse 4)
You're the butter on my bread my heart beat and every breath you the pepto bismol after a Mexican buffet and you are the Britney Spears to my Justin timber lake cuz let's be real that Jessica biel phase isn't gonna last (nope she sucks) your just like the Vaseline to a really embarrassing rash that one might've been a little gross but I think you can understand clearly lets top it all off with a cliche - Girl you complete me!!

(Chorus)
Your more than just a ball and chain your part of me I hope I've made that clear with all these analogies bear with me have a little patience I'm tryna think of all the ways that I say this we go together better than bacon and scramble eggs  I'll make this easy for you with more analogies just like the moonlight would be gone without the sun I'm not even myself without your love!
