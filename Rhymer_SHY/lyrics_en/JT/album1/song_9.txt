I'll pick you up when you fall down
They won't destroy the light they found

I need no introduction
By now, I hope you know
I've spent so long away from home
And so I'm going rogue
Agent Locke and me
We gotta drop the beef
He's got the bigger problem
Because he's not the chief
And if you're not with me
You're probably thinking of stopping me
But I got you're next-gen
Spartan Armor looking obsolete
I'm rocking Mark VI
Still I'm awful hard to beat
Luck is on my side
I'm practically a walking prophecy
Starting with the fall of Reach
I was the Spartan prodigy
But when I lost Cortana
Everything just fell apart for me
Super soldier blood
Pumping through my arteries
Call me the Reclaimer
Now I'm taking back my property

Jealous? You oughtta be
Whenever I accomplish a colossal feat
I'm everything the Covenant want to be
In fact, the only one they cannot defeat
Yo, Dr. Halsey don't follow me
And don't think i'll forget
What you've done to me
Tell Locke and Arby to get off of me
Somebody gotta save these colonies
Yo, guardian, what do you want from me?
Your shockwaves aren't shocking me
I don't give a damn if you got a job for me
Forget the Bungie, I'm falling free
Destiny belongs to me
Writing my own prophecy
I'm only growing stronger
Cuz Cortana, you're a part of me

You've gotta keep on pushing on
(i'll pick you up when you fall down)
Cuz after all, you know that's what I want
I will always be in your heart
Be the light when it gets too dark
Keep your memories alive
(i'll keep you alive)
I'll be the angel by your side
I'll be the angel by your side

I've said this before
In case you're wondering
I'm not a Forerunner
But I'm forerunnin' this
See my helmet?
You won't spot a Halo above it
On a great journey
But I'm cutting out the Covenant
Hope you brought your skill, son
Because I brought a ton of it
And just like an infection
Me and my team are Flooding in
Covered by my MJOLNIR
Time to bring the thunder in
Got the grunts running, screaming
"it's the demon coming in!"

I can take a lot of shots
From you Jameson
Hope you can adjust
Because it's a new game you're in
Got a lot of pressure that you're under
Don't be cavin' in
I bet that all you're Spartan IV training
Ain't the same as this!
You'll be dust in the wind
Hunt the truth, you're not gonna win
Reclamation starting again
Don't get in the way, that was a command
Got the mind of a God, heart of a man
On my own as I walk in the sand
This dogtag I got in my hand
Believe it or not, is a part of the plan
I'm gonna try as hard as I can
To bring Cortana back from the dead
I'm never gonna put the matter to rest
If you've got a problem, save your breath
In all the Chaos I can hear her voice singing through
I'm gonna bring her back if it's the last thing I do!

You've gotta keep on pushing on
(i'll pick you up when you fall down)
Cuz after all, you know that's what I want
I will always be in your heart
Be the light when it gets too dark
Keep your memories alive
(i'll keep you alive)
I'll be the angel by your side
I'll be the angel by your side

Fireteam Osiris
You are signing up to die
This ain't a black and white assignment
I mean, why would I be lying?
I'm as deadly while I'm rhyming
As I am when I be sniping
Rapid battle rifle fire
I could do this while I'm blinded

Making an entrance when I'm arriving
All of my rivals will end up dying
I was imprinted by the divines
Go read a Bible, I'm the Messiah
Only Reclaimers will get invited
Locke, did you finish the fight? cuz I did
Like a pilot, I'm the flyest
Keep the standards at their highest
I'm just trying hard to keep the peace
Leave the Promethean's to me
Vale, Buck, Tanaka, see
You don't want to get off
On the wrong feet with me
Hunters, Jackals, even Elites
None of them are gonna go down easily
Beast Mode on if I need it to be
I hear these Guardians speaking to me

343 Guilty Spark
I guess he had his reasons
Only took a couple laser beams to defeat him
Wrote my Destiny
And left the rest of you to read it
People call me Master Chief
Those who know me call me Jesus
Ain't no number
Quite as sacred as 117 is
Spent 4 years asleep
But I was barely sleeping
And though Cortana's gone
A piece of her I'm keeping
Open up the heavens
Now I'm going back to Eden
They took everything from me
So I'm just getting even!

You've gotta keep on pushing on
(i'll pick you up when you fall down)
Cuz after all, you know that's what I want
I will always be in your heart
Be the light when it gets too dark
Keep your memories alive
(i'll keep you alive)
I'll be the angel by your side
I'll be the angel by your side
I'll be the angel by your side
I'll be the angel by your side
I'll be the angel by your side
