[Intro]
The first time was a bad time
And ever since that time, I was tryna get it back
But I can't... get back to that place

[Verse 1]
Scrolling trough your phone, got the message I left you
I still remember the latter
I got your scent on my sweater
You said that we would be forever
Know I did you wrong, every day, I regret it
I hope you know I never meant to
It's my edition, I confess it
It's got me stuck in this depression
I hope that you know
That I love you so
But he's got control
So pray for my soul

[Hook]
I've been waitin' for you all time
Got a couple things I need to say to you
See, I got it bad (bad)
I got it bad (bad)
Recreation always started for the fun and games (yeah!)
Now I'm paralyzed and need it in me every day
See, I got it bad (bad)
I got it bad (oh yeah) (bad)

[Verse 2]
Taken over by this type of feelin'
Beautiful glory y'all oppressing
Every time I made a promise to you I can last five, then I'm back to sinnin'
Good and evil, I live in the vision
I don't know if I can kick or dish it
Now you thinking I'm a good guy, but I've been the devil, got my fork pitchin'
Praying for me, praying for me
I know you care for me, there for me
Just I can feel it deep in my depression
When the evil said they reaching for a weapon
That's when I pause and think about your letter
You gave me hope that things were getting better
You've been my line of fog in the weather
Level: legendary, breaking records

[Hook]
I've been waitin' for you all time
Got a couple things I need to say to you
See, I got it bad (bad)
I got it bad (bad)
Recreation always started for the fun and games (yeah!)
Now I'm paralyzed and need it in me every day
See, I got it bad (bad)
I got it bad (oh yeah) (bad)

[Outro]
I've been bad for so long
And I don't even know what's right or wrong
What do you say if it doesn't work, Michelle?
One: I'm prepared, then you take them on
