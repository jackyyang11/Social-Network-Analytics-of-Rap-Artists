[Hook]
Tell me you can do it like me (Like me)
Bruh, I swear nobody here in my league

Rare breed (rare breed)
To my city I'm another 23
It's that major league homie, major league
To my city I'm another 23

To my city I'm another 23

[Verse 1]
What you know 'bout me these days
I do these things
I'm puttin' on for my city
You know I'mma ride for the A
Carried the city
Before they believed me I played the poistion
Grind for the love of the game
But don't mind if I'm takin' these riches (yeah)
Most of y'all never heard of me
Your attention ain't earn me
23, on my back homie thats real talk me major league
Most the time I be out of state
With my heart beatin' that home plate
30k in that blue [?]
I'm checkin' out the return date
I just put in work
I just put in work
So when I'm away on business know my city give me work
I step back like game time
Hit the pump fake views on mind
You know I come through in the clutch
Throwin' it up for my city like one time

[Hook]
Tell me you can do it like me
Bruh, I swear nobody here in my league
Im Tai-Chi
Rare breed
To my city I'm another 23
To my city I'm another 23

To my city I'm another 23

[Verse 2]
We takin' over
Lemme see ya go [?}
Back in my city and we doin that [?]
I'm talkin' bout no filter, I mean it
And we teamin'
Sweatin' this love like hoodie season
Turnin' up for no apparent reason
Your parents love that I'm [?]
No [?] cause we out late
Good times but I stay straight
And I'm up early on redbull
Headed out west on I-8
No [?] on my plate
He's my high for your sake
I stay focused like 23
All time  all great
