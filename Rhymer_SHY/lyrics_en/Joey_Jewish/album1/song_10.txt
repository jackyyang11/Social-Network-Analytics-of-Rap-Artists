[Intro]
I just gotta tell you something

[Verse 1]
Wisdom is better than silver and gold
Or so I've been told
Chasing the wind or the breeze
Give me the money, the liquor, the keys
Ended in emptiness
[?] is left all alone
Left right out my window
Now we're freezing like it's ten below
I know
Oh, I said I know
Oh and it's so deceiving
It's so misleading
I can't believe I believed that
I can't believe I believed that

[Hook]
Stuck out here in Brixton
I know that You can fix it
Stuck out here in Brixton

[Bridge]
Here in Brixton
Here in Brixton
I swear I feel like something missin'
All alone here in Brixton (all alone)

[Verse 2]
Let's go
This is ain't the matrix and I am not new to your game that your playing on me
[?] graded on these
Glass of [?] got me faded my G
Now you're swift in negotiations
Tell me how much I'm making, hotels where I'm stayin'
Saying it's just like a vacation
Til I eat the paper then it's off to Californication
Got a revelation, wisdom taught me patience, but I brush it off and took the infatuations
Fantasize over minor sensation
I swear I felt like I was gold in the making
I made it, but I never did
110, Arizona kid
Smoked it away like a cigarette
Life without You is irrelevant
Oh Lord, yeah
Oh my Lord
Oh my Lord
Oh my Lord

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yes Lord
Yes Lord
Oh my Lord
Oh my Lord
