(Phone Call)

(Pre Hook)
When it's goodbye don’t you hang your head low
Know it's hard when they say you gotta let go
Take your tears watch me turn into a red rose
And when it's over comes a rainbow

(Hook)
Look into the sky for the rainbow
Dry your eyes for me love I’ma see you soon
Look into the sky for the rainbow
Don't you worry bout a thing, I'ma wait for you

(Verse)
I lost you way too young
Still remember the first time you saw the shining sun, yea
You are the blinding one
I swear you showed me the meaning of what living was
And I can't believe you're gone, did nothing wrong
I couldn't understand
Pictured living long and growing old
That's what I had planned
Find it hard to let you go
I took a trip to Mexico
I wish you could've seen the beach with me, it’s unbelievable
Waves on waves on waves, yea
I been in a daze, yea
Think it’s all a dream, whoa
Maybe I'm going crazy
Know our conversation is so overdue
I just made this song cause lately I’ve been missing you

(Pre Hook)
When it's goodbye don't you hang your head low
Know it's hard when they say you gotta let go

And when it’s over comes a rainbow

(Hook)
Look into the sky for the rainbow
Dry your eyes for me love I'ma see you soon
Look into the sky for the rainbow
Don't you worry bout a thing, I'ma wait for you
Look into the sky for the rainbow
Dry your eyes for me love I'ma see you soon
Look into the sky for the rainbow
Don't you worry about a thing, looking over you

(Verse 2)
I try to call you still
Practice everything you said
You don't know how it feels
Yea
They say in time you heal
I'm still tryna find a way up to that holy hill
Yea
Life goes way too fast
I put my foot on the gas
Another year in the past
No let up
In a minute we go'n be back together
So i put my trust in God
In time I know it's gets better, yea
I been out here waiting
Some days I can't take it
Know that I've been racing
Lord give me some patience
I keep on looking to the sky
Know it's just a little time, dry your eyes love
