[Verse 1]
Rolling down the street in my 64
So now you know
That's how we do it on the west coast
Blessings from my Savior keep me growing
Riding with the dream team 64 sitting on gold
I stay king, man
Thats just how I roll
Switches on the ride
How high can your old school go?
Everybody showing love from the back
To the low-low
Shout out to my city, T-town
Yeah the boy homegrown (AZ all day)
Catch me skipping out to Vegas
In the 7, on the very first row (that some show)
Do it all one time
Two time for the whole coast (how we go, yeah)

[Pre Chorus]
Never been no sucka so you know (You know, you know)
Don't try flexing 'round me big, no-no (don't let that, oh no)
Crossing up those fingers let it show (click-clack, click-clack, click-clack)
Rolling down the street in my 64 (west coast swang beat)

[Chorus]
Rolling down the street in my 64 (West coast swang beat)
Rolling down the street in my 64 (yeah, yeah yeah yeah) (oh)
Crossing up those fingers let it show (West coast swang beat)
Rolling down the street in my 64

[Verse 2]
One time finally, it's all mine
Palm trees, cool breeze
On the west side
Stay low key, yeah I get mine
Top drop, car clean, on the green light, yeah
I do it so they know
Bass so loud
Buy one slow
Ain't gotta move fast
Her eyes are more
Sucking in deep
Let it all go
Yeah-ya

[Pre Chorus]
Never been no sucka so you know (You know, you know)
Don't try flexing 'round me big, no-no (don't let that, oh no)
Crossing up those fingers let it show (Click-clack, Click-clack, click-clack)
Rolling down the street in my 64 (west coast swang beat)

[Chorus]
Rolling down the street in my 64 (West coast swang beat)
Rolling down the street in my 64 (you know, you know)
Crossing up those fingers let it show (West coast swang beat)
Rolling down the street in my 64

[Outro]
Palm trees, cool breeze
On the west side
Rolling down the street in my 64
