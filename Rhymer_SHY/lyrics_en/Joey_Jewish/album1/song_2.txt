3 a.m. in Paris
I'm caring for you
Taking all my fairest
I give it to you

Come take a ride with me
Fly with me
We can go anywhere
Come take a ride with me
All night with me
Let the wind blow through your hair

I don’t wanna see no picture
I don't wanna take no part
Let the (?)
I'm just free fallin’
Fallin'
Fallin' to you

'Till the Sun comes up
'Till the Sun comes up
Yeah
'Till the Sun comes up
'Till the Sun comes up
Yeah
