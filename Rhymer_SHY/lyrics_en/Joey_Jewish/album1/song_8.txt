[Chorus]
Falling off the top of the roof
I can see the skyline
50 mile radius on my timeline
Ain’t nothing on my mind
Oh Lord running outta lifetime
And I'mma just roll with it
And I'mma just roll with it
And I'mma just roll with it
Falling off the top of the roof
I can see the skyline
50 mile radius on my timeline
Ain’t nothing on my mind
Oh Lord running outta lifetime
And I'mma just roll with it
And I'mma just roll with it
And I'mma just roll with it

[Verse 1]
Vino got me locked up in the booth
Rehabilitated now I'm here to get ya loose
First one in the class looking like I'm 42 (Jackie Robinson)
Yea this is that illegal they be calling up the blues
Uh
Hit one more rock for the kill
You do not know how I feel
Stop trying to relate to me like your ill
See what you’re doing for minimal gains started off real now you’re on no chill
I should put a cork up in the bottle
That’s a pretty thought but I don’t do it I don’t want to
I just want to tell it like it is
This the type of music you ain’t showing to your kids
I got a problem, I am a problem
Know what the answer is don't wanna solve them
I just wanna vent what I'm feeling, wish I could kill em
Deep in my mind I know I am the villain
Lately been thinking bout pilling
Mixing it up in my cup for that healing
Juicing are dripping I'm up on the ceiling
I'm dealing with situations that are real and, I doubt that you know what I'm talking about
Why I even have a doubt
Tell me what it feels to have a meal king bed for you to chill
While you sucked up all the luxury I fought to pay the bills

[Chorus]
Falling off the top of the roof
I can see the skyline
50 mile radius on my timeline
Ain’t nothing on my mind
Oh Lord running outta lifetime
And I'mma just roll with it
And I'mma just roll with it
And I'mma just roll with it
Falling off the top of the roof
I can see the skyline
50 mile radius on my timeline
Ain’t nothing on my mind
Oh Lord running outta lifetime
And I'mma just roll with it
And I'mma just roll with it
And I'mma just roll with it

[Verse 2]
Two times
I done crashed and I burned but I don’t die
I just wanna know my purpose for this life
Am I here to do it big like a coal mine?
Got a cold mind
Because everyone that I trusted is so disgusting
I think about all your bull when told me that this is what love is
Love it or leave it, you left me I’ll never forget it
But I had to let it go or I’d never fully be ready

[Bridge]
That’s the time that I had to stay faded
All my visions and love were so jaded
What it taste like?
Beauty of the solitude that I face, right?
See I would probably catch another case, right?
Bet you'd love to see me gone, call it to take flight
I'mma do it
On this ledge I sit
It’s on this ledge I live
And I'mma go do what I’m bout to go do with this

[Chorus]
Falling off the top of the roof
I can see the skyline
50 mile radius on my timeline
Ain’t nothing on my mind
Oh Lord running outta lifetime
And I'mma just roll with it
And I'mma just roll with it
And I'mma just roll with it
Falling off the top of the roof
I can see the skyline
50 mile radius on my timeline
Ain’t nothing on my mind
Oh Lord running outta lifetime
And I'mma just roll with it
And I'mma just roll with it
And I'mma just roll with it
