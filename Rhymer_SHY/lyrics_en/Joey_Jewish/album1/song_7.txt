Huh, yeah, they sleepwalk, now you see me ball, wow!

[Verse 1]
I been balling (yeah)
They been calling (why?)
Still remember who was there when I was falling (yeah I do)
When I needed you the most why were you stalling
(where you at?)
You was eating like a king while I was starving (uh-huh)
You left me for dead
Remember weeks that I could barely eat
Billed me as a threat
But I saw you like we were family
Love is never backwards
I learned that from my past hurts
Pain gave me a bachelors
But love made me a master
Quit acting like you been in the field (in the field)
You got rich off being fake & taking people meals
Act like you don’t know what's happening
Just keep it real
We know who you really are
And I'ma keep it trill
