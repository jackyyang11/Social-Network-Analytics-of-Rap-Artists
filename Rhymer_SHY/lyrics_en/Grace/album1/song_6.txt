[Verse 1]
Kinda hot in the kitchen, yeah
My cup is already half full
It's the taste that I'm feeling
No milk and two sugars if that's cool
Cool, cool

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't sleep when it's late
But that ain't me complaining
Nobody can keep it like you (Oh, oh)
So good, I can taste it
But you're gone, I crave it
Nobody can make it like you (Oh, oh)
By the time you're leaving (yeah)
I'm begging you to stay (yeah yeah)
And if you leave, I'd only get in your way
You can keep me needing
Even when I am awake
But the coffee never tastes the same, yeah

[Chorus]
My babe, my baby
My babe, my baby
I drink so much, I guess they call it love
My babe, my baby
My babe, my baby
You keep me up, I just can't get enough

[Verse 2]
It's 3 AM in the morning
Ain't never been so lonely
I just wanna wake up to you (you)
And you could be that, you could be the one that I'm needing
Honey, just let them be yours

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't sleep when it's late
But that ain't me complaining
Nobody can keep it like you (Oh, oh)
So good, I can taste it
But you're gone, I crave it
Nobody can make it like you (Oh, oh)
By the time you're leaving (yeah)
I'm begging you to stay (yeah yeah)
And if you leave, I'd only get in your way
You can keep me needing
Even when I am awake
But the coffee never tastes the same, yeah

[Chorus]
My babe, my baby
My babe, my baby
I drink so much, I guess they call it love
My babe, my baby
My babe, my baby
You keep me up, I just can't get enough

[Bridge]
Oh my sugar-sweet, I wanted to say
I really really need you to stay
You're my sugar-sweet, I wanted to say
You're the only way to start my day

[Chorus]
(Oh oh oh)
My babe, my baby
My babe, my baby
I drink so much, I guess they call it love
My babe, my baby
My babe, my baby
You keep me up, I just can't get enough

[Chorus]
My babe, my baby
My babe, my baby
I drink so much, I guess they call it love
My babe, my baby
My babe, my baby
You keep me up, I just can't get enough
