Dr. Rhythm by G'Race
I can live without you, I've waited for a year
Your picture ain't enough, boy, oh, I'm so glad you're here
Here's to aggravation, doctor is in town
We gotta keep on dancing as the music goes around

Dr. Rhythm, Dr. Rhythm
Dr. Rhythm, Dr. Rhythm

Yeah, there's a party going on
It's gonna last all night long
Yeah, there's a party going on
It's gonna last all night long

Blow your whistle!

Amona, amona
Sing along, amona
(Amona, amona
Sing along, amona)

All the people dancing to the jungle beat
Happiness in our dream, by the dance we meet
Movin' and-a groovin', having lots of fun

Dr. Rhythm, Dr. Rhythm
Dr. Rhythm, Dr. Rhythm

Dr. Rhythm, Dr. Rhythm

Yeah, there's a party going on
It's gonna last all night long
Yeah, there's a party going on
It's gonna last all night long

O-way-o (O-way-o)
Ayayayay (Ayayayay)
I like it, I like it (I like it, I like it)

Blow your whistle!

Party, party, party, party
Party, party, party, party

Dr. Rhythm, Dr. Rhythm
Dr. Rhythm, Dr. Rhythm

Party, party, party, party
