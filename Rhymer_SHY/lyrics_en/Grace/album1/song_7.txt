[Verse 1: Grace]
Boy you playin' with fire
You don't want my tension
Gonna put up a fight
Cause I know that this lil' light's gonna need a big reflection
You don't wanna ignite it, it could be somethin' special
They gonna need a river now, tryna put this blaze out
This the same as his affection

[Pre-Chorus: Grace]
Babe, need to tame me before it's a little too late
Baby, I don't know if you hear what I'm trying to say

[Chorus: Grace]
Don't get too close
Real hearts burn slow
I could feel the heat
We should turn it down low
I could feel the heat
We should turn it down low
Turn it down low, we should turn it down low
You want that love? Don't do D-low
Can't keep it hush hush when I'm tryna explode
Hold me tight, never ever let go
Hold me tight, never ever let go

[Post-Chorus: Grace, Parker]
Hold me tight, never ever let go
Hold me tight, never ever let go
Never let go, never let go
Hold me tight, never ever let go
Hold me tight, never ever let go
(Flames, flames going crazy over here)
Hold me tight, never ever let go
(Flames going crazy over here)
Never let go, never let go
(Flames, flames going crazy over here)
Hold me tight, never ever let go
(Flames going crazy over here)

[Verse 2: Grace]
Boy we're flowin' like a lava, got so much in my selection
Got a flicker so right
Had you rub me all wrong, second guessing it was lightening
Oh, the water's so solid, we can even hear a whisper
But the flame is so low, we can make a [?] out of [?] river

[Pre-Chorus: Grace]
Babe, need to tame me before it's a little too late
Baby, I don't know if you're hear what I'm trying to say

[Chorus: Grace]
Don't get too close
Real hearts burn slow
I could feel the heat
We should turn it down low
I could feel the heat
We should turn it down low
Turn it down low, we should turn it down low
You want that love? Don't do D-low
Can't keep it hush hush when I'm tryna explode
Hold me tight, never ever let go
Hold me tight, never ever let go

[Post-Chorus: Grace, Parker]
Hold me tight, never ever let go
Hold me tight, never ever let go
Never let go, never let go
Hold me tight, never ever let go
(We should turn it down low)
Hold me tight, never ever let go
(Flames, flames going crazy over here)
Hold me tight, never ever let go
Never ever let me go

[Bridge: Grace, Parker]
Flames, flames going crazy over here
Flames going crazy over here
Flames, flames going crazy over here
Flames going crazy over here
Flames, flames going crazy over here
Flames going crazy over here
Flames, flames going crazy over here
Flames going crazy over here
Flames, flames going crazy over here

[Outro: Grace]
Hold me tight, never ever let go
Hold me tight, never ever let go
(They're going crazy over there baby)
Never let go, never let go
Hold me tight, never ever let go
(Flames going crazy over there)
Hold me tight, never ever let go
(Yeah)
Never let go, never let go
Hold me tight, never ever let go
(Yeah)
Hold me tight, never ever let go
Never let go, never ever let go

Never let go, never let go
