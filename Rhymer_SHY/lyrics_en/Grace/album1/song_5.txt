[Verse 1]
Another waste of Friday night
Another time I gotta stand out just to stand in line
I got some questions on my mind and things I can't explain
Like why I feel like going dancing every time it rains
And why is hell the pain
And why [?] when you know it's me
Why you make me [?] when it's free
We get so caught up in life we're losing simplicity
We make heaven hell and it's hard to tell

[Pre-Chorus]
Motherfucking well I don't know
I'm confused, tell me where should I go
Life's a breeze but I swear that we blow it
Ooh, ooh
Motherfucking well I don't know
Leaning on a fairtytale sugar coated
Looking like a house for sale, we don't own it
Ooh, ooh
Don't you over complicate it, just be happy that you made it
Clap your hands

[Chorus]
Clap your hands now people clap now
Clap your hands now people clap your hands
Clap your hands now people clap now
Clap your hands now people clap your hands
Well I ain't gon' fall, so break your stance
Cause you gotta let it go if you wanna dance
Clap your hands now people clap now
Clap your hands

[Verse 2]
You ever wonder when you got somebody
They don't want you when you lonely
You can't find nobody
It's just a question, I'm not tripping cause I came to party
And throw my hands to the ceiling
Lift your hands if you're with me, come on
Can't be no pressure thinking on another level [?]
[?] digging down, yeah the devil might cry
Too many questions , never know what was the [?] and the worst
Maybe life's [?], can't be scared to fail

[Pre-Chorus]
Motherfucking well I don't know
I'm confused, tell me where should I go
Life's a breeze but I swear that we blow it
Ooh, ooh
Motherfucking well I don't know
Leaning on a fairtytale sugar coated
Looking like a house for sale, we don't own it
Ooh, ooh
Don't you over complicate it, just be happy that you made it
Clap your hands

[Chorus]
Clap your hands now people clap now
Clap your hands now people clap your hands
Clap your hands now people clap now
Clap your hands now people clap your hands
Well I ain't gon' fall, so break your stance
Cause you gotta let it go if you wanna dance
Clap your hands now people clap now
Clap your hands

[Bridge]
All that we are is mere humans with flaws
We take bruises and scars til we come out on top
Don't know the answers so we take our chances
We need second chances so we never stop
What is the common place so we find the common stones we [?]
Future's uncertain, take it day by day
Don't you over complicate it, just be happy that you made it
Clap your hands

[Chorus]
Clap your hands now people clap now
Clap your hands now people clap your hands
Clap your hands now people clap now
Clap your hands now people clap your hands
Well I ain't gon' fall, so break your stance
Cause you gotta let it go if you wanna dance
Clap your hands now people clap now
Clap your hands
