The universe, so far and wide
The stars are out, of reach
As long as you, are by my side
Then there's no need, to speak

And every day, I live
It's so hard to, ????
The only way, to live
Is leave it as, it is

You're changing the scenes, you're changing your plans
You're changing the reason, you must understand
You can't change a thing, so you better come down to earth

You're changing the scenes, you're changing your way
You don't last forever, so live for today
You can't change a thing, so you better come down to earth

Come down to earth

The wind is brushing by my face
There's nothing I can do
And every day, I leave
A part of me, in you

The universe, so far and wide
The stars are out, of reach
As long as you, are by my side
Then there's no need, to speak
