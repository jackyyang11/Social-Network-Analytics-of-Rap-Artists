[Verse 1]
Looked in your eyes and I knew it was over
Told me you tried and put your hand on my shoulder
Don't touch me, I don't want your pity
Crazy In Love, we would play it on repeat
Told me I was your B, and you were my Jay Z
You called time, gave me no warning sign

[Chorus]
I'm wearing, yeah, I'm still wearing your jeans
Still roll them up, still got that hole in the knee
I bought into the dream that you sold me
When you told me I'd never be lonely
The joke's on me, yeah

[Verse 2]
Straight to my house when you picked up your first car
I didn't care that it came from a junkyard
Sunday drives, you were my ride or die

[Chorus]
Still wearing, yeah, I'm still wearing your jeans
Still roll them up, still got that hole in the knee
I bought into the dream that you sold me
When you told me I'd never be lonely
The joke's on me, yeah

[Bridge]
Now I choke on the words that I wrote for you
How am I supposed to sing them now
Boy, you're breaking my heart
You're breaking my heart
Cause I'm still...

[Chorus]
I'm wearing, yeah, I'm still wearing your jeans
Gotta roll them up, still got that hole in the knee
I bought into the dream that you sold me
When you told me I'd never be lonely
The joke's on me, yeah
The joke's on me, yeah

[Spoken]
Could you hear us talking out there?
Wasn't really bad, was it?
