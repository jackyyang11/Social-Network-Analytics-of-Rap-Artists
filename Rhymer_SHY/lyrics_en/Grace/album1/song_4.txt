[Intro]
Oh, yeah
Oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Ain’t really my type, but we locked eyes
One time for the cool guy
Blowing up my phone so I made time
Had you thinkin' you were so fine
And since I told you he was all mine
You’ve been keepin’ this poppin’ in my sideline
Sounds bad, but I can’t lie
So wrong but it feels right

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But it ain’t true, I should’ve thought this through
Why is it I never seem to know?
I didn’t mean to lead you on
I know it ain’t you
I should’ve thought this through
Oh, baby it never seems to last
‘Cause I’m too scared to take a chance

[Chorus]
Hate to see you’re falling for me
And I hate to leave you lonely
But my heart is cold as can be
Gotta go to church on Sunday
Used to wear my heart on my sleeve
Everything is not what it seems
Boy, you should be running from me
I gotta go to church on Sunday

[Verse 2]
Met a cute boy and he got cash
Real tall, and I like that
He was in the back of my friend's class
Real bool, so I let him pass
Took it for a ride, shit went fast
Never knew where we was going
Tried to slow it down, tried to make a dash
When we crashed it was all bad, all bad

[Pre-Chorus]
But it ain’t true, I should’ve thought this through
Why is it I never seem to learn?
I didn’t mean to lead you on
But it ain’t you
I should’ve thought this through
Oh, baby it never seems to last
‘Cause I’m too scared to take a chance

[Chorus]
Hate to see you’re falling for me
And I hate to leave you lonely
But my heart is cold as can be
Gotta go to church on Sunday
Used to wear my heart on my sleeve
Everything is not what it seems
Boy, you should be running from me
I gotta go to church on Sunday

[Bridge]
And I bet you gon’ call me cryin’
Saying you pray that I see the light
That don’t bother me, I don’t mind
You gotta learn that love hurts sometimes
To say that I care it would just be a lie
You should have never wasted your time
And if we only got just one life
Why does it feel like it’s such a crime?

[Chorus]
Hate to see you’re falling for me
And I hate to leave you lonely
But my heart is cold as can be
Gotta go to church on Sunday
Used to wear my heart on my sleeve
Everything is not what it seems
Boy, you should be running from me
I gotta go to church on Sunday
