Misunderstood (Hook) Its furstrating when you put life in the bars that you write And only some will feel it But not the whole planet And in the end, they never understand. (Verse 1) Am im too complex for the underground and youth My seed been planted but they cnat understand my roots I paint picture of art that spark across the planet I worked hard for mine while others took what they handed I tryed to make a avenue that only me can walk on And every track I write, I put my heart on but they won't understand. Is it because im christian or is it cause im wack My circle know that all i spit is facts around the map But every show i rock on they only feel the rhythm with that, I strongly feel this why the game in a syndrome Its crazy how that when i drop a track. They either shrug it off or only listen if its plat cause they dont understand. (Hook) Is being me enough to make it as an artist. Is talk about that thug life will show that im the hardest Because i rap my middle name, they never gonna listen if they feel the rhyme, then comprehend every line Nevermind cause when you put the life in the bars that you write and only some with feel it but now the whole planet and in the end, they never understand. (Verse 2) Am I too complex for the industry and TV. They only want that real unless the beat is made in 3-D But 9 out of 10, every artist talk the same garbarge Them old classics taught me how being you make an artist And this is what i did, I came with Chuck D and add that Flavor to my style that made me and they dont understand I manged my career, it still a working progress Even though my discography is small them songs honest I been patience from day one and now i see my rise i may not be a star yet, it'll only come with time Most of them christian rappers signed with reach But me i dont follow, i lead the pack to reach the souls that weak but in the end they never understand. (Hook) Would you go buy my album Would you go to my shows Could you say im artist Can u recite my woes. If i talk secret cults would you say im a lier if you can feel the rhyme, then comprehend every line Nevermind cause when you put life in the bars that you write and only some will feel it But not the whole planet And in the end they never understand
