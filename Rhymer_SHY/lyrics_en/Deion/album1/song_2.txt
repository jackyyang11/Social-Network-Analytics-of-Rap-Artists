I got that black attack syndrome
Rap that fact syndrome
When I get on mic, I'm pro-active  that change skintones
Poof Poof
Tell Grizz to press the button if not I'll press your button
I came in the game with 6 years of building
My right eye can see below the chronicles of villians
I got scriptures that turn your wicked to civilian
Im direct you to my soul food like George Tilman
I got lines that rotate your thoughts to hide from me
If you a proud monkey, then I'm the iron monkey
I kick rhymes that goes over your head like jianzi
This world got us dicing our lives into monopoly
Trump taking the globe and turning it to jumanji
I separate so distraction don't try to blind me
I got a job ask Tommy cause he my witness
Im lyte as a rock no plymouth watch the young and gifted
Shifted to the greatest that's debatable
Just know you got served cause when you see me ill invade the floor
I got bars and I ain't here getting to paid to flow. My peeps know I writes raps and I don't have to pay the flow
You guys star catch. Im farfetch
Im signed tate without the radio and I ain't lost yet
While im out here buying hearts you guys lost debt
Where my competition, where they at look they all left. Look around
You guys begging for awards for a validation
Im tryna bring a bomb like gilead so my people sacred
Im not a false prophet out here that mislead the nation
Don't label me lecrae them reach records ain't in my playlist
How many movies do they talk about us being slaves
Yall wasn't living in it. Yall all pretending in it
So stop pretending like yall know it all and been though it
The game is fiction to the point I now Condemn music
Yall say there no God but call them rappers Rap gods
What they the Gods of Egypt. You horus im bek

Signing off the last MC that's standing left."
