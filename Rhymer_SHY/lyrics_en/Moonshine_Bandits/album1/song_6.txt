Go ahead and arrest me
And send me straight to hell
Tell the sheriff come get me
Go ahead and arrest me
And send me straight to hell
Tell the sheriff come get me
And take my ass to jail
Yeah, I’ve been drinking on this bar stool
Now all my money’s gone
So go ahead and arrest me
And take my drunk ass home

No, I never thought
I’d be sitting right here
A Monday morning drinking beer
Yeah, I’ve always been a hard working man
Providing for my family
Do the best I can
Yeah, I know that times are tough for us all
Hell, pour me a drink
Pour me a drink of alcohol
No, I never thought
I’d walk into work
Early this morning
And get treated like dirt
I’ve been busting my ass
For fifteen years
What’s a man got to do
To get respect around here
Called in by the boss-man
He laid me off
Hell, I need a drink
(Pour me a drink)
Better make it strong

Go ahead and arrest me
And send me straight to hell
Tell the sheriff come get me
And take my ass to jail
Yeah, I’ve been drinking on this bar stool
Now all my money’s gone
So go ahead and arrest me
And take my drunk ass home
(Here we go again)

Two hours on my shift
But it’s way too long
So I just clocked out
Told the boss I’m gone
Hit the dirtiest bar
Because they pour em so strong
The only thing I do right
Is doing wrong
Don’t try to cut me off
Before I pay my tab
Cause I drink too much
But they can kiss my ass
Grab a pool stick quick
If I get in some shit
Tell the bouncer come get me
And I’ll bust his lip
So I blew a point two
From the boys in blue
One night in the county
Ain’t nothing new
The sheriff got his boys
And they wanted to catch me
Call that old bitch up
Tell them come and arrest me
I start running
And they start chasing
Face down in dirt
Wearing matching bracelets
Now I’m off to the can
For a free night stay
Eat my breakfast in the morning
And I’m on my way

Go ahead and arrest me
And send me straight to hell
Tell the sheriff come get me
And take my ass to jail
Yeah, I’ve been drinking on this bar stool
Now all my money’s gone
So go ahead and arrest me
And take my drunk ass home
(Lemme hear some guitar)

Go ahead and arrest me
And send me straight to hell
Tell the sheriff come get me
And take my ass to jail
Yeah, I’ve been drinking on this bar stool
Now all my money’s gone
So go ahead and arrest me
And take my drunk ass home
