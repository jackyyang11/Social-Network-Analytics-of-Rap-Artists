Baptize me in Bourbon
Baptize me in Bourbon
Baptize me...

Baptize me in Bourbon
Fill me up, let me down
Give me bottles, plastic cups and shot glasses
Pull my troubles out and let 'em drown in the Bourbon
Until all my dirt is gone
I learned my lessons, count my blessing
Take my messes all and baptize them in Bourbon

Sipping on some whiskey and I'm listening to Stapleton
Meditating on mistakes I said I'd never make again
Devil tries to call me but I put him on hold
[?] for me at home then he left me in the cold
Now I'm all alone, left me with these skeletons
Lungs full of smoke so I guess I'm back in hell again
Try to blow it out but this flame is getting hotter
Now I'm left here trying to put it out with this muddy water

So take the top off the bottle, let me take it
Put my lips to the Bourbon, let me taste it
Take this pain that I got and erase it
Wash my cares away
Take the top off the bottle, let me take it
Put my lips to the Bourbon, let me taste it
Take this pain that I got and erase it
Wash my cares away

Baptize me in Bourbon
Fill me up, let me down
Give me bottles, plastic cups and shot glasses
Pull my troubles out and let 'em drown in the Bourbon
Until all my dirt is gone
I learned my lessons, count my blessing
Take my messes all and baptize them in Bourbon

But I'ma empty out my promises, pour 'em in the glass, let the wind blow
I'm gone with this this, strike another match
Regret, I got a lot of it, reflecting on my past
I burned a few bridges that I wish I had back
Forgive me father for a life that's too fast
Help me pick up the pieces that are lying in the ash
If I had a ounce of round for every time I shoulda asked
I could fill an empty river, baptize me in that

So take the top off the bottle, let me take it
Put my lips to the Bourbon, let me taste it
Take this pain that I got and erase it
Wash my cares away
Take the top off the bottle, let me take it
Put my lips to the Bourbon, let me taste it
Take this pain that I got and erase it
Wash my cares away

Baptize me in Bourbon
Fill me up, let me down
Give me bottles, plastic cups and shot glasses
Pull my troubles out and let 'em drown in the Bourbon
Until all my dirt is gone
I learned my lessons, count my blessing
Take my messes all and baptize them in Bourbon
Fill me up, let me down
Give me bottles, plastic cups and shot glasses
Pull my troubles out and let 'em drown in the Bourbon
Until all my dirt is gone
I learned my lessons, count my blessing
Take my messes all and baptize them in Bourbon
