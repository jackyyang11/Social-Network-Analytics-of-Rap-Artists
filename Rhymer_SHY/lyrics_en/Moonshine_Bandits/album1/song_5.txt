Folded flags and memories
Photographs and the rosary
She hangs her head as the choir sings
And she cries, and she cries, and she cries, and she cries
Cause her family was waiting at home and was praying for him to survive
That folded flag that she now holds, she holds it close tonight

Shots rang out, another angel cries
Open up the gates when he arrives
As he fell to the ground there was no fear in his eyes
They'll bury him before they bury his pride

This is for my people that are fighting overseas
This is for my people keeping all the kids free
Another brother got shot, another RIP
This is for my people that died for you and me
For the Red, White and Blue, the Stars and the Stripes
The gunpowder residue on the letters you write
For every picture that you send to your lonely wife
I wish that we could see you just one more time
Now this little old town showing you a lot of pride
Every store downtown has got a Flag outside
Today I bought a six pack and went for a drive
I'm wishing we could spend it like we did in 05
I remember what you told me when you signed on the line
You didn't do it for the fame, didn't do it for the shine
You didn't do for the money, didn't do for a dime
You did it for your Country and American Pride

Shots rang out, another angel cries
Open up the gates when he arrives
As he fell to the ground there was no fear in his eyes
They'll bury him before they bury his pride

For the Red, White and Blue, the Stars and the Stripes
Red, White and Blue, the Stars and the Stripes
For the Red, White and Blue, the Stars and the Stripes
I did it for my Country and American Pride

Shots rang out, another angel cries
Open up the gates when he arrives
As he fell to the ground there was no fear in his eyes
They'll bury him before they bury his pride

Shots rang out, another angel cries
Open up the gates when he arrives
As he fell to the ground there was no fear in his eyes
They'll bury him before they bury his pride

So the next time you see a Soldier at one of our shows
You buy that Soldier a drink and you tell them Thank You
And then you make a Toast to Freedom!
