We get blacked out
We get blacked out

The truck that I'm rolling (Blacked out)
The smoke that I'm blowing (Blacked out)
Back road, no light, we're (Blacked out)
By the end of the night we'll be (Blacked out)
The truck that I'm rolling (Blacked out)
The smoke that I'm blowing (Blacked out)
Back road, no light, we're (Blacked out)
By the end of the night we'll be (Blacked out)

We get blacked out, blacked out, blacked out, blacked out
We get blacked out, blacked out, blacked out, blacked out

Bus all black, truck all black
Half that Jack but I won't black out
Bump that man in black
All blacked out in a Cadillac
Pull that throttle back
Said I don't black out from a bottle of Jack
So sip that, pass it back
Hit a bump in the sub when the bass go slap
Slicker than the slobber on my bulldog's jaw
Tougher than the rawhide they're chewin' on
Black out super duty gun rack out
Tou talk too slick, boy you get blacked out

The truck that I'm rolling (Blacked out)
The smoke that I'm blowing (Blacked out)
Back road, no light, we're (Blacked out)
By the end of the night we'll be (Blacked out)
The truck that I'm rolling (Blacked out)
The smoke that I'm blowing (Blacked out)
Back road, no light, we're (Blacked out)
By the end of the night we'll be (Blacked out)

We get blacked out, blacked out, blacked out, blacked out
We get blacked out, blacked out, blacked out, blacked out

I don't remember yesterday
I just know I was on the stage
Now I'm drifting down that lonely road
Through another state
Blacked out from the moment
Of them screaming fans holding on to me
Yeah, I was born to play the highway
But I never sold my soul
I won't stop till I've been in every town
I don't know when I'll go home
I'm living in the moment
You see me on the stage
Blacked out, blacked out

The truck that I'm rolling (Blacked out)
The smoke that I'm blowing (Blacked out)
Back road, no light, we're (Blacked out)
By the end of the night we'll be (Blacked out)
The truck that I'm rolling (Blacked out)
The smoke that I'm blowing (Blacked out)
Back road, no light, we're (Blacked out)
By the end of the night we'll be (Blacked out)

We get blacked out, blacked out, blacked out, blacked out
We get blacked out, blacked out, blacked out, blacked out
