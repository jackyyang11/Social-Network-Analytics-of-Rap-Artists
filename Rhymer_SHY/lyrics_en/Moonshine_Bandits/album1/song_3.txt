Stayed hard on the grind and took 'em head on while the others went ducking
They told me don't try and now they all trying to here the songs that I'm cutting
Big stage, big lights, and everybody acting like it happened all the sudden
They want it all over night, thinking they can make it with the push of a button
But I ain't hearing nothing

(Listen up) You don't start back with the parties at the shop
We were dirt road rapping to some B.I.G. and 'Pac
Keg in the Chevy, couple bags of pot
We were running from he cops in the high school parking lot
Cellphone down ain't no WiFi round
I've been seeing blue healers into right side of town
I was raised on fish sticks and tater tots
Back when my mom and dad worked day jobs
Now they're sipping [?] from a Styrofoam
Trying to fish and pull in for a microphone
Everything I drop hot, just a milestone
Go ahead say I'm lucky you will the dial tone

Stayed hard on the grind and took 'em head on while the others went ducking
They told me don't try and now they all trying to here the songs that I'm cutting
Big stage, big lights, and everybody acting like it happened all the sudden
They want it all over night, thinking they can make it with the push of a button
But I ain't hearing nothing

This a hard working son'bitch you see in the mirror
It's the same old cat that's been grinding for years
If you're dreaming while you're sleeping then I guess you just lazy
I'm running through the finish line, runner ups chase me
Running that grind, didn't happen overnight
Hard to see second place when you're first in line
Rain here or nothing, not even a little, nope
25 rib eyes on my black stone grill
40 foot bus with the trailer a hitch
I ain't talking lease, I done bought that bitch
[?] piss away about 80 a plate
But it still eats shit till my cabin's on the lane

Till my mom got a cabin on the lake
Till my lady got a cabin on the lake
Till me team got a cabin on the lake
Till my whole damn team got a cabin on the lake

Stayed hard on the grind and took 'em head on while the others went ducking
They told me don't try and now they all trying to here the songs that I'm cutting
Big stage, big lights, and everybody acting like it happened all the sudden
They want it all over night, thinking they can make it with the push of a button
But I ain't hearing nothing

Stayed hard on the grind and took 'em head on while the others went ducking
They told me don't try and now they all trying to here the songs that I'm cutting
Big stage, big lights, and everybody acting like it happened all the sudden
They want it all over night, thinking they can make it with the push of a button
But I ain't hearing nothing
Nothing
But I ain't hearing nothing
Nothing
