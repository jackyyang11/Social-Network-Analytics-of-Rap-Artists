Moonshine Bandits (Bandits)

Everybody get loose, get out of control
5150 and we lock and load
Get loose, get out of control
5150 and we lock and load
Everybody get loose, get out of control
5150 and we lock and load
Get loose, get out of control
5150 and we lock and load

Mama told me slow down, fast living is my motto
Everything I do, you know I do it full throttle
You can have the can but I'll take the whole bottle
6 shots slam but you'll never see me hobble
Write a jack up, you got flats on a bottle
Angel riding shotgun, black Silverado
Dive beauty queen looking like a model
Law on my tail 'cause I'm living full throttle

Everybody get loose, get out of control
5150 and we lock and load
Get loose, get out of control
5150 and we lock and load
Everybody get loose, get out of control
5150 and we lock and load
Get loose, get out of control
5150 and we lock and load

You love me, love me, way out in the country like damn
Senior, junior, bring it to you like mail
I might fail, but hey, I might sale
Enough to tell, ya'll the hushin', hush it well
What the hell is Bubba doing? He just a ruin
That brand new Chevy, and damn you betty, he wasn't bored
I heard he put them 44s up underneath it
He did a year and since he did, it's been tough to reach him
Either hate it or let it motivate
Life is going great, yeah, it's going great
Ain't too much more to say, truck running great
Color muddy grey, won't put my gun away
Obama, Osama, the Dalai Lama
My mama, Trump or Clinton, maybe my mama
'Cause bitch I'm a big dog, 50 run 50
And I'm all jacked up so is anyone with me

Everybody get loose, get out of control
5150 and we lock and load
Get loose, get out of control
5150 and we lock and load
Everybody get loose, get out of control
5150 and we lock and load
Get loose, get out of control
5150 and we lock and load

I'm going full throttle while you stop and go
Motor so hot make you drop and roll
Living real fast never lost control
Even when the cops tried to stop my show
Straight to the top like a rocket, whoa
Little hip hop with some rock'n'roll
Count down on the clock, oh no
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, let's go

I'm filling up my cup and I might act up
Filling up my cup and I might act up
I'm filling up my cup and I might act up
Filling up my cup and I might act up

I'm jacked up, I'm jacked up
I'm jacked up, I'm jacked up
I'm jacked up, I'm jacked up
I'm jacked up, I'm jacked up

Everybody get loose, get out of control
5150 and we lock and load
Get loose, get out of control
5150 and we lock and load
Everybody get loose, get out of control
5150 and we lock and load
Get loose, get out of control
5150 and we lock and load

I'm jacked up, I'm jacked up
I'm jacked up, I'm jacked up
I'm jacked up, I'm jacked up
I'm jacked up, I'm jacked up
