You know what
This song right here goes out to every single music venue
Every bar any spot that's banned me, banned us
Banned my Shiner family
For having a damn good time
This one right here goes out to you

Used to mail my demo to the suits and ties
Saving my money just to write more rhymes
Praying to God, will he show me a sign
All I saw was Satan, all I heard was lies
Radio hates me, just like Coe
They ain't gonna play me and this I know
So I grabbed the cloud and rode that bitch
All my Shiners, are gonna to bump it
This is for the bikers in the blacked out baggers
Rednecks bumping Cash, Hank and Haggard
Still rolling stoned, call me slick Mick Jagger
Lift kit high, grab my dad a ladder
Bought my own bus, bought my own bar
Billboard charts 'cause I work so hard
Small town living, still shopping at Walmart
To pornstar women, tell mama I'm a rockstar

Oh we've been banned across America
For raising too much hell across the land
So if you think my Shiners are to rowdy for ya
Well here's a middle finger from my hand

Sold out shows every time I throw down
Mama said "Son, boy you better slow down"
I'm living too fast I ain't pumping my breaks
Tell Johnny Law to come and run my plates
TV hates me just like Coe
Had my own show just like Big Smo
Seacrest signed us then he switched up
I'm too outlaw for a network pickup
Guess we've been banned, they don't wanna see us play
The hard rock stage at the CMAs
Or the Toby Keith bar into any state
I'm a renegade, I'm a goddamn renegade
Even easy riders banned our band
Are we in Sturgis or Disneyland
Ain't no sugarcoating what I'm saying
Here's to me and the hell I'm raising

Oh we've been banned across America
For raising too much hell across the lands
So if you think my Shiners are to rowdy for ya
Well here's a middle finger from my hand

Oh we've been banned across America
For raising too much hell across the lands
So if you think my Shiners are to rowdy for ya
Well here's a middle finger from my hand

Oh we've been banned across America
For raising too much hell across the lands
So if you think my Shiners are to rowdy for ya
Well here's a middle finger from my hand
