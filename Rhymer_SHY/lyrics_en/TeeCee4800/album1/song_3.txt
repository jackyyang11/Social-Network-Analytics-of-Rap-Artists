[Verse 1:]
Westside is the lick
TeeCee is the cut
Can’t get enough of this gangster shit
Still rock Cortez's still rock Shell told ya fuck with me
I’m a let some of these shells go
Catch me at the foot level
Macking and hanging
Posting and slinging
N*gga pimping ain’t bad
We just too busy gang banging
If you ever meet me n*gga shake my hand with two fingers
That’s the value bitches make a lot of mood with Topanga
Got the kush in the closet n*gga hanging on hangers
N*ggas trying to bring it back
N*gga banging on wax
Little n*gga but I stayed with a big ass strap
Out of town smoking bigs
Still hitting up clinics
Hit the switches gotta bounce a n*gga
Banging on limit hit the sucker
How you tripping and the henny just finished?
Pussy real good bitch
I’m 'on bust in two minutes
I got in the top riding shotgun
You know I don’t give a fuck about neither none
I hit the blunt n*gga I don’t play a snare none
It’s me and my homies
Now you wanna fair one

[Chorus:]
All I know (All I know)
How to get that dough
How to get that dough
Don’t trust no hoe
Don’t trust no hoe
And it’s loyalty over everything
All I know
Just me and my bros (how to get that dough)
It’s a woman that knows (trust no hoe)
Loyalty over everything my n*gga

[Verse 2:]
Had a couple bros get caught up in they feelings
Fuck your n*gga for some money that ain’t realness over millions
I’m just trying to make a million
What you n*ggas mad at me for
And I can’t trust you n*ggas got me creeping through the peephole
Loyalty is everything my n*gga what you mean
You n*ggas say no new n*ggas but shit that’s all I see
I’m just trying to keep some mother fucking clothes up on my back
If I don’t make it with this rap then hell yeah I’m going back
I’m talking bitch straps and a Cadillac
Looking for a tiny snatch
Grind me n*ggas you fit that
If you false n*gga I need that
Hey I can say rocking jimmies n*gga
Cuz ain’t no pussy good enough to get burned while you up in there
Hey and that’s really the real deal Holyfield
I’m just the weed while I’m driving grab the wheel
And I put a sign up ruthless n*gga
Since he ain’t here Whitley you toothless n*gga

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Westside is the lick
TeeCee is the cut
Can’t get enough of this gangster shit
Still rock Cortez's still rock Shell told ya fuck with me
I’m gonna let some of these shells go

[Chorus]
