[Verse 1 ]
It was early in the morning
Niggas started yellin'
Grab the pistol, walked about the house and started [?]
Where your money at? Ay I do this all the time bitch
Eatin' good big steaks nigga need a toothpick
Who this? now I can have my dough around 8 ish
Oh shit it's the homie Mister Fat Head crip
Been broke for a minute but nigga I ain't jump shit
I'm still here with the same niggas that I started with
D-Loc, Big TC [?] and Marley Blu
Young ring hoppin' out the wheep [?]
I grew up in the hood sellin' weed and sellin' crack
Midtown nigga
From the morning to the night it wasn't a easy job
Trynna get that money right
I'mma mothefucker player, call the chopper [?]


[Hook]
It was 7 in the morning (7 in the morning)
Nigga trynna get it (nigga trynna get it)
Tryna make a million (tryna make a million)
Don't give a fuck about these bitches
It was 7 in the morning (7 in the morning)
Nigga trynna get it (nigga trynna get it)
Tryna make a million
Don't give a fuck about these bitches


[Verse 2]
Now 7 at night, time to catch a flight
Tellin' poeple that I made it
I say don't believe the hype
A nigga need a million
I'll be alright
Until then it's MTM and I'mma grind on my life aye
Same niggas that I grew up with
Ever since my bitch left me I been on my shit
I don't give a fuck about no new kicks
I'm tryna stack it my nigga I need a ticket
Never trick it, never fakin' the game
If I ain't got, you ain't never see me rockin' fake chains
I'm a real one in the game, they ain't tryin' give me mine
But I'm kickin' in the door, like a 4-5-9
What? 4-5-9, aye now that's a motherfucker rich crime
It was 7 in the morning (7 in the morning)
A nigga gettin' it why you [?]

[Hook]
It was 7 in the morning (7 in the morning)
Nigga trynna get it (nigga trynna get it)
Tryna make a million (tryna make a million)
Don't give a fuck about these bitches
It was 7 in the morning (7 in the morning)
Nigga trynna get it (nigga trynna get it)
Tryna make a million
Don't give a fuck about these bitches
