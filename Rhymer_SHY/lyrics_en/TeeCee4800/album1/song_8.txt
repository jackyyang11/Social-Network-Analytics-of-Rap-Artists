[Verse 1 : Teecee4800]
If I gave a fuck about a bitch, I'd always be broke
I'd never have no mothafuckin' endo to smoke
Ask TeeCee the loc, you don't know by now?
I'm that ganged up nigga with that midtown sound
Hit the club in my Dickies on some gangsta shit
She bad, I give her this gangsta dick
Ride slow down your block in that gangsta whip
Extra clips, if you run then you better not trip
Now she blowin' up my phone tryna get that ring
Hold up, bitch, that nigga [?] just got hit
You can talk to the boss, shit I ain't gon' trip
All that talkin' out your mouth, you can suck this dick
All my life, all my life
Stack this money, I don't need no wife
All my life, all my life
Fucked you once, might fuck you twice
Aye!


[Hook : Teecee4800]
