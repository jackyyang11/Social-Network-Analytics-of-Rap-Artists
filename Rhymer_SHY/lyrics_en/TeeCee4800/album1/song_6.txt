[Verse 1 - TeeCee4800]
I ride bangs and loc’d up brads
Smoke backwoods and catch fades
Fuckin’ with the top top top my nigga
Tryin’ to live through the night, don’t fuck with my niggas
And we ride two deep, four heat
No stash box, burner on my lap like a laptop
Fuck a cop, nigga rather go to jail than get shot
Fuck and I’m gettin’ these scrabbles up
Nigga will get these scrabbles up
It’s the movement bitch but you know we steady mobbin’
Niggas give a fuck ‘bout no sirens
Look at them niggas, they wildin’
We goin’ crazy, ‘cause we ain’t never had shit
Give back to the homies, care what they do with it
I be in my own lane, never switchin’ for the fame
Yeah I love this rap shit, but I miss the dope game
Tally tally tally, used to kick in doors nigga
Used to bang, big guwop, while I keep the Dows nigga

[Chorus - TeeCee4800]
I’m gettin’ high, ye ain’t know it maine
I love this rap shit, but I miss the dope game
Smoker on every corner
Live and die in California
Gettin’ high, ye ain’t know it maine
I love this rap shit, but I miss the dope game
Rocks up in my mouth nigga
That’s why I don’t play if they tryin’a get ya

[Verse 2 - Berner]
I’m from North Cal
Pull up with the 40. cal
White girls in the club still hold me down
Do a show, meet the homie, move forty pounds
I love this street life
Rap cat, but burn got the sweet price
When the Chuck touch down, we gon’ eat right
Two xanny bars yeah I’m a sleep tight
I’m rollin’ cooks, blowin’ dope money
In the club, three girls, new Goyard on me
No love, know my heart it’s too cold homie
Wait the polygraph yeah they leave it on the door for me
I can never leave the dope game
No half steeze we do the whole thang
We push the cookie of the cocaine
Got my weed runnin’ through the whole state

[Chorus - TeeCee4800]
I’m gettin’ high, ye ain’t know it maine
I love this rap shit, but I miss the dope game
Smoker on every corner
Live and die in California
Gettin’ high, ye ain’t know it maine
I love this rap shit, but I miss the dope game
Rocks up in my mouth nigga
That’s why I don’t play if they tryin’a get ya
