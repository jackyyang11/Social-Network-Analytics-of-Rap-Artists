[Verse 1]
I’m going buck wild
Nigga talkin’ shit, go pow
Nigga [?] back for a while
Nigga did beef for a while
[?] Chukka my style
[?] Chukka my lango
I ain’t flexin’ nigga
I’m a be Chucky yo bankroll
Hit up your bitch that’s a crip date
I’m a talk something no bullshit
You’sa bitch nigga you ain’t gon’ do shit
Got a big ol’ Glock with the full clip
I be with the nine chains like Jango
And missin’ that tag with the Mango
Got a new tech with a jump rope
I was [?] at [?]
Tally tally, keep a bitch mad at me
Never had a job no salary
I was on the block with a bag of weed
I was on the block with a bag of crack
I was on the block with a big strap
Wild nigga pull up then a body gettin’ mismatched
Niggas ain’t seen shit
Nigga ‘cause the same shit happens to them niggas that chit chat

[Chorus]
Nigga stop that flexin’
Stop that flexin’
Nigga, you will get ride
Quit all that flexin’
Everybody know you a bitch
Everybody know you a bitch
Everybody know you a bitch
Everybody know you a bitch
Nigga stop that flexin’
Stop that flexin’
Nigga, you will get ride
Doin’ all that flexin’
Everybody know you a bitch
Everybody know you a bitch
Everybody know you a bitch
Everybody know you a bitch

[Verse 2]
Everybody know you a bitch
Fake nigga, knew you a switch
Everybody know I’m [?]
Bitin’ lil nigga I was born in licks
Everybody know I got hits
Everybody know I’m with the shits
Nigga diss bitch nigga to the Feds
Police come now nigga you’ll probably snitch
Talk shit I bust a nigga lip
With the [?], look at this realness
I’m a real nigga stay by the field, is
I’m a real shooter, they gon’ peel shit
Nigga give me your bitch I’ll pump her
Fell in love Harley Quinn like Joker
Niggas keep doin’ all that flexin’
I’m a rob all your friends, they chumpers
Then I go and cash ‘em out quick
Fifty bands have a town nigga feelin’ rich
Might blow it all in a day
I ain’t trippin’ nigga I’m paid
I ain’t trippin’ nigga I’ve got cake
Never throw a nigga no shade
Might catch a bitch nigga slippin’
Rob a nigga later on that day

[Chorus]
Nigga stop that flexin’
Stop that flexin’
Nigga, you will get ride
Quit all that flexin’
Everybody know you a bitch
Everybody know you a bitch
Everybody know you a bitch
Everybody know you a bitch
Nigga stop that flexin’
Stop that flexin’
Nigga, you will get ride
Doin’ all that flexin’
Everybody know you a bitch
Everybody know you a bitch
Everybody know you a bitch
Everybody know you a bitch
