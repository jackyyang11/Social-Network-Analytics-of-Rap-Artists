These lips can't wait to taste your skin, baby, no, no

Just let my love

[Verse 2: Dj KevyRaw]

Uh
Hold up Shawty I be down for whatever
You can own the night I be in charge of the weather
I'll make it rain on you, see them bitches hating on you
And them niggas  talking but they ain't saying nothing clever
I'm willing to share this life with ya, Pose for the right picture
Mona lisa smile, girl I just want a night with ya
Then again a life with ya, then again a fight with ya
Just so we can make up, maybe spend the whole night with ya
I'm aite with ya
Got ya down for diamonds and pearls
And If it was my call I'd given you the world
But its not like that, all I can promise is I won't fight back
Put us on the right track, shows after shows and to you I be coming back
Hoes after hoes, your personality they lack
Poems after poems, I was hoping that
One day you finna get to listen nd  write me back
Let my love adorn ya don't stifle that
Girl I got you once you got us
Be my ride or die chick can't nothing stop us
Be my ride or die chick, won't need a side chick
(Nah bitch)
Can Someone hit up cupid tell him get the ooze
The mission is her heart bring it right to me

[Fill: Miguel]
Oh oh
Let my love adorn you baby
Don't you ever
Don't you let nobody tell you different baby
Just let my love adorn you
Please baby, yeah

You gotta know
You gotta know
You know that I adore you
Yeah baby

[Hook 2: Miguel]

Le-le-le-let it dress you down
You gotta know, baby
Oh, you gotta know
Know that I adore you
Oh, love ain't never looked so good on ya
Ooh, put it on baby
Let my love adorn you
