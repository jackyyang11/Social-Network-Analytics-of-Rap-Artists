VERSE 1
I just wanna have fun
Have fun and make money
Always on some ill shit
Around good people I could build with
Champion the ones that I'm near most; fellow outcasts and weirdos
I'll do it all without a co-sign
My fucking mind is a goldmine
Write a book, go to school, save a life, learn a language of a land
Love a little bit harder
Man watch when I get my whole dream
I can't wait, put my whole fucking team on
Ooh, it's just a matter of time
A matter of time (2x)
Cause I ain't afraid to fail
Can't you tell?

CHORUS
I want it all (4x)
Tell me that it's selfish
But is it selfish?
I mean it could be kind of selfish
Fuck it, everybody's selfish

VERSE 2
I just want the whole world
To know it's real
Don't hear my passion
Don't you see I'm ill
So let me put you on this art shit
You know smart shit
Help you bring your mind to a better place
Teach each other how to elevate
Yeah, elevate, elevate, elevate, elevate yeah
Oooh it's just a matter of time
A matter of time (2x)
Cause I ain't afraid to fail
Can't you tell?

CHORUS 2x

I want it all...

(Instrumental)

I want it all (4x)
T-t-t-tell me that it's selfish...
