(Intro)
Nah this ain't take long I'm finna do this real quick
Real quick, gimme, gimme a second
We gon go with Teryaki after this
I gotta eat clean now, well clean again
I had fell off a lil bit
But I'm still good

(Hook)
The sauce is still on me
It's dripping and flowing
It looks like I'm bleeding
I don't need consoling
I'm ravioli
Inside beefing
Don't try to control me
I'm not the old me
Outside I'm cheesing
I'm macoroni
But way more expensive man now I'm Poppone
Who's my opponent
They do not want it
You can't destroy me
I keep on scoring
It's becoming alarming
Like I'm paying the goalie
We pull up so deep
I brought the whole team
To hide that I'm lonely
But it's an illusion
I'm outche like Loki
But don't get confused

(Verse 1)
I got some problems
But I'm gonna solve em
I don't need yo knowledge
I don't need yo help
I'll do it myself
I don't need a hand these the cards I was dealt
That Cain got her feenin and if I am not able I guess I'll just leave it to Seth
That's a line you won't get no disrespect
But y'all way too talkative
I'm fresh to deaf
Don't know what to call it
Cause I'm not a ref
Don't look at Quincy Jones cause he not gonna help
I bought a microphone and nothing else
I'm not worried bout food cause I'm not a rapper
Aha a chef
Taking shots like I'm Steph
I don't know how much times on the clock
Ima make sure y'all hear me beat down the block
I won't say I'm sorry when I'm not
This a reminder just in case you forgot
Go head!!!

(Hook)
The sauce is still on me
It's dripping and flowing
It looks like I'm bleeding
I don't need consoling
I'm ravioli
Inside beefing
Don't try to control me
I'm not the old me
Outside I'm cheesing
I'm macoroni
But way more expensive man now I'm Poppone
Who's my opponent
They do not want it
You can't destroy me
I keep on scoring
It's becoming alarming
Like I'm paying the goalie
We pull up so deep
I brought the whole team
To hide that I'm lonely
But it's an illusion
I'm outche like Loki
But don't get confused

(Verse 2)
What is yo issue?
Do you need some tissue?
Why you complaining?
Cause nothing is broken I'm paying you all of these tokens you trippin man what is you smokin
I know you not playing
That's why I benched you
Don't make me dismiss you
You see where I'm aiming at
Cause I gotta point to prove
And Im not gonna miss you
I hang with the OG's
It's me and Ginobili
We grillin with Kobe
I'm still on the island with Master Roshi
The girls in the sand playing Vollyball called me want me to come over
They stay asking questions like "how tall are you?"
I don't know taller than Yajerobi
I don't know how much time is on the clock
So Ima make sure you hear me beat down the block
I won't say I'm sorry if I'm not
This a reminder just in case you forgot

(Hook)
The sauce is still on me
It's dripping and flowing
It looks like I'm bleeding
I don't need consoling
I'm ravioli
Inside beefing
Don't try to control me
I'm not the old me
Outside I'm cheesing
I'm macoroni
But way more expensive man now I'm Poppone
Who's my opponent?
They do not want it
You can't destroy me
I keep on scoring
It's becoming alarming
Like I'm paying the goalie
We pull up so deep
I brought the whole team
To hide that I'm lonely
But it's an illusion
I'm outche like Loki
But don't get confused
(Finale)
The sauce is still on me
It's dripping and flowing
It's looks like I'm bleeding
I'm doing fine
I'm wasting time
I'm ravioli
Inside I'm beefing
I'm drained and I'm leaking
But outside I'm cheesing
Im macaroni
But way more expensive man now I'm Poppone

Now I'm Poppone
Now I'm Poppone
Now I'm Poppone
