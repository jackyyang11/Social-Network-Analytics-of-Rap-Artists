[Verse 1]
I'm the best ever
Even if the DJs don't play me
Even if the girl that I love won't claim me
Even if my rocket crashes down to the ground
And I never get the crown like I'm Tracy McGrady
Even if my trees lose its leaves while it's raining
Still look at what we created
So technically we already made it, right?
I got it going up like mountains
You can keep counting
Me and God together power over 9000
Gotta watch the cheese cause there's way too many mouses
If my bro don't make it to the league he gon' be my accountant
Scared of wasting time with people who don't care about me
If the spirit ain't right then you need get from round me
Everybody's presence ain't a gift, watch the monsters
They take out all the coal and put your souls in the stockings

[Hook]
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, it's gon' be okay
Never mind don't worry bout I'll be better off by myself anyway
'Cause even if they ain't rolling with ya
Just keep rolling like an 18 wheeler
When you see me you better move
When you see me you better

[Verse 2]
Change does two things to weak people
Either makes themem strong or makes cut others to feel even
Let's play a game called "How long will the king keep breathing?"
The contestants are Henry, Edward, Martin, and Jesus
Boom there goes the dynamite
Not a friend in sight
That's ironic cause when I blow up they gone do the opposite
More guest appearances than TV shows that come on late at night
And have the nerve to ask me why I'm never feeling right
Im going up like I'm hiking, the Avatar on his bison
I'm tryna stay away from playful bunnies but they so energizing
I'm not playing when I say I'm crazy
Don't love me, I don't advise it
Just be glad that God came and stopped me like Abraham and Isaac
'Cause the people know whats real and they running out of options
so when the others fade just remembers who's the prophet
They only sticking with you when they see that they can profit
That's why I got the sauce on a plate for you imposters

[Hook]
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, it's gon' be okay
Never mind don't worry bout I'll be better off by myself anyway
Cause even if they ain't rolling with ya
Just keep rolling like an 18 wheeler
When you see me you better move
When you see me you better

[Verse 3]
Now we eating at hibachi bruh
Grubbing while we chop it up
This was back when Welch still had his dreads locking up
Said that we don't have to sell our soul
We can still reach the goal
Never seen a group of blacks play hockey, huh?
Juno looked at me and Ruff and said, "Why y'all not cocky bruh?"
Said that he remembers when nobody wanted to rock with us
Welch gave the look and said that loves the only option, bruh
Juno ate a shrimp and laughed and said that we the mafia
And now he back in Little Rock, I see him up on Instagram wiling
He don't talk about it but I know he's havin some problems
Don't hit him up enough cause in my mind I know he's surviving
Plus who am I to tryto lie 'cause we all be backsliding
Made me think about this girl that I tried to run game on
I thought that it was cute the way she would say my name wrong
But those who really know me know I'm bad with the opposite sex
But in the heat of the moment well, I just got my flame on
I laughed when she said she liked the one night thing over the wife thing
'Til this day I still wonder if I did the right thing
Welch said I'm stupid
Well that's just me putting it kindly
He said even leaders need reminders
We all be backsliding
We all be backsliding
'Cause when the sun comes out they'll be in the picture shining
But when the rain comes down they'll be underground hiding
We all be backsliding
It's Aha
