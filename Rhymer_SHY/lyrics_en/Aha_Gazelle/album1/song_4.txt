Extra cheese on the pizza
Five meat, ha

Somebody give me a reason not to go hard
It's Aha

[Verse 1]
Uh, all I do is eat wings and make beats all day
Man I'm covered with the sauce like Picante
And then I cut them off like Super Bowl Beyonce
You can catch me with the clippers like Deandre
Black kid acting white my anatomy's gray
These other rappers acting hard but I can never relate
A new party every week we sick of saving the dates
You will never be official like Beyonce
If God gave us all gifts then mine was sitting under the Christmas tree up off the Grinch
And all I do is work, eat, sin and repent
When I'm supposed to spend time I don't pay five cents
If it all comes down please don't push me up under
So many burdens that I carry out just pray I don't fumble
I just stop and turn around like I'm tired of running
When you finally learn that you can do it all if you wanted
I promise

[Hook]
All I ever ask for is one
Cause I can turn a one into a two
And I can turn a two into a three
I feel like everybody's counting on me
Somebody give me a reason not to go hard
(It's all I want, it's all I need)
Somebody give me a reason not to go hard
(It's everything you was to me)

[Verse 2]
I'm doing all that I can like ()
They blow up like Pompeii
Some people I meet in back woods like ()
But I don't show love cause when I die I want to get high like Smokey from Friday
But please comprehend you are not my compadre
I'm working on giving my momma a spa day
I man who don't work cannot eat and I'm trying to get entree on entree on entree
Probably way to much for you to digest
I'm sorry I can't process the point in even doing this
If I am not the hottest my brain is way too crowded
I like to keep them guessing why you think I switched the topic?
I don't even see the purpose no more
These ain't just verses no more
This ain't rehearsing no more
It's getting too personal
I need a reason to believe in somebody new
Because the last one said I'm not the same person no more
I got a question
Do you only talk to God for a blessing?
Do we only show up because we know we get him refreshments?
Do you use your gift to get a check every Sunday and the girl that you wanted and after you get what you want you don't even try to respond to the message?
I don't know why I'm talking because y'all too messy
These are real life lessons
This the drink all night and wake up and hope I forget it
This is why I hope I never do run out of forgiveness
Man

[Hook]
Dear God I just ask you for one
Cause you can turn a one into a two
And you can turn a two into a three
While you got these people counting on me
Somebody give me a reason not to go so hard
(It's all I want, it's all I need)
Somebody give me a reason not to go hard
(It's everything you was to me)

I'm on the roof holl'in', "Get up on my level"
I'm on the roof holl'in', "Get up on my level"
I'm on the roof holl'in', "Get up on my level"
I made sure to wear an all black shirt so you can see my gold medal
I hope they don't get mad and come and try to hit me with the metal
Everyday I pray that God protects me from the Devil
Y'all here for a minute well us we gon' be here forever
Y'all here for a minute well us we gon' be here forever
Forever
For eva-eva?
For eva-eva?
Forever
