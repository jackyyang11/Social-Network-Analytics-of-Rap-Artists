[Hook]
I知 back
Back in bag (back in yo bag?)
Been gone so long
Almost forgot what I had
Wipe me down, With a rag (with a rag?)
God is good my girl is bad
I was gone but now I知 back
Back in my bag (back in yo bag)
Been gone so long almost forgot who I am
Wipe me down
With a rag (with a rag)
God is good my girl is bad
I was gone but now I知 back

[Verse 1]
Back in my bag like a ransom
Back in my bag like I知 snacking
I go through a lot so my heart is heavy
I知 moving weight like a fat kid
I got so much going on in my head
I feel like an improper fraction
There痴 no in between I知 either black or white
I guess I feel like Michael Jackson
I知 the man like Pac
I知 well trained on the track
They make you pick the cotton then sell shirt
But leave that trash on the rack
I don稚 rap I attack
I知 on point like a tack
I see some people getting mad
Cause I was gone but now I知 back

[Hook]
I知 back
Back in bag (back in yo bag?)
Been gone so long
Almost forgot what I had
Wipe me down, With a rag (with a rag?)
God is good my girl is bad
I was gone but now I知 back
Back in my bag (back in yo bag)
Been gone so long almost forgot who I am
Wipe me down
With a rag (with a rag)
God is good my girl is bad
I was gone but now I知 back

[Verse 2]
I知 back in
They lookin like who let them cats in
But I'm not a cat, I'm not a dog
If I'm not the goat, I'm a dragon
They ducking the fade they quackin
I know some grown men who wanna act 10
Cause they know they値l never
Be the man again
I just act like I知 a mannequin
Because they don稚 deserve no reaction
They funny actin, it got my laughin
I知 back in my bag
Like I知 packing
I travel cuz I'm in the NBA and y'all Pac-10
I don't have it all, but I'm not lacking
I知 not harassing
I知 just asking
If I can take her out like an extraction
I got so much drive but I知 back in
Reverse
Play this song at the church
God is great, God is good
My girl is bad, and I知 worse
I stomp on the beat like I'm Kirk
I wear it out like some merch
God said the last gon' be first
So I got it poppin like a perk
You can稚 play this game from the bleachers
So I practice everything I知 preaching
Don稚 call me fam cause we ain稚 related
If you got my blood it痴 cause you leaching
I be on stages but I don稚 act
I知ma last forever but don稚 got no tats
I feel like Jesus gone play this song
When the sky crack like
I was gone but now I知 back

[Hook]
I知 back
Back in bag (back in yo bag?)
Been gone so long
Almost forgot what I had
Wipe me down, With a rag (with a rag?)
God is good my girl is bad
I was gone but now I知 back
Back in my bag (back in yo bag)
Been gone so long almost forgot who I am
Wipe me down
With a rag (with a rag)
God is good my girl is bad
I was gone but now I知 back

[Outro]
And I shoulda never left
It's Aha, man
Oh, they gon' ride
They gon' ride
(It's Aha)
