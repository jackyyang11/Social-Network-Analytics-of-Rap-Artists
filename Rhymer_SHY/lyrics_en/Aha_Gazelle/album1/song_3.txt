(Intro)
Reg Rob: Guys when you're with your white friends, make sure you're using your L-Y's
That's definitely, completely, absolutely, and don't forget...totally

(Aha)
Got the beans the thang on the coffee lean..
I already told you don't touch it you gon' burn yourself
Its hot, hot things are hot
Hard things are hard
Gold things shine
Kings do King things
What you want me to say?
Leave the money on the table next time..

(Verse 1)
Ima problem and they know it
They don't really wanna see me blow up
Momma told me to ignore it
Cause can't nobody stop what God ordered
Hallelujah!!!
From the south but I'm colder than a polar
Louisiana born yea I from the NOLA
Ya'll know that I believe in the Lord
But don't think that I won't show it
Hold up wait a minute
Lately I've been getting bored
Like what am I'm doing this for
I'm all about I no droid
Cause wasn't nobody calling me before
People wanna buy me like a store
But don't nobody wanna keep it 100 with me
I'm sorry but I'm worth way more
I keep it 150 like a Ford

(Hook)
Having dinner with higher ups, tryna show em that I'm really down
I'm real young and I'm fired up, so excuse me if I'm a little loud
I know that we just met but girl you touch my soul like a foul
But I ain't got time right now, I gotta go make my family proud
Hold Up...
Ima
Problem
And they
Know it
You can't
Stop me
From where I'm
Going
Every
Thing I
Touch Is
Golden
Extra
Cheesy
Maca-
Roni
Roni, roni, roni
Cheese
Roni, roni...
Cheese
Roni, roni, roni
Whooaaaa ahhhhhaaaaa
It's Aha man..
(Verse 2)
I got this chick who stuck around so we could blow together
But we was Nike socks and Yeezys we didn't go together
She was like you just wrote a song, I sad the more the better
Just give me some time I promise we gon wear this Gold forever
She left...
And now I'm sitting in this back seat on my to dinner
Messing up my liver all on Twitter talking bout
How Ima be the winner, Ima be the victor
Then I text that said she miss me but I'm sorry I can't be the Mr
Cause Ima problem and they know
They don't really like to see me scoring
They started giving strikes trying to cover up my light
Until they realized I was bowling
That All White Party I set it on fire
Get money and treat you like Lizzie McGuire
When they put you on a stage acting required
They say Aha don't lay it down the devil is a liar
Oill: Chill broooooo

(Outro)
Yeaaaaaaaaa

I was born interesting ain't nobody give me lessons
All I hear is Aha why you do that
Man they ask too many questions they don't listen for the message
