[Intro]
Yeah
It's Aha
Free Barabbas out
Y'all still 'sleep though

[Verse 1]
Yeah
I learned a game from David Beckham and I ain't even metal
Everyday I go running just to fight my depression
I write a run-on sentence and end it with a question
I'm proof that you can graduate and still not learn your lesson
People call me like, "I see you dog, your time is coming
I put my homies on your music and they all love it
I think that we should work together, we can kill the summer"
And I be at a loss for words 'cause I didn't save they number
It's not my job to save you, I have no obligation
And Jesus died for that, but I know she's in love with Satan
They hate 'cause I'm a walking talking living demonstration
Started as Ronald McDonald and went to Ronald Reagan
Rapper with no compassion, it got me going harder
Hanging with athletes and that, just pretending I'm a starter
She told me to buy her a drink and we can take it farther
I smiled at her and said, "That's a [?]"
That's for my believers who think I left 'em hanging
Scared to let go of the rim, I had no business banging
Just know that I hear everything, I'm sick of the complaining
You busy wasting time, just know the game is changing
Why you walking on the court, be running back and forth?
Yeah, back and forth
On the same team but they don't cheer when I score
Yeah, who the really playing for?

[Verse 2]
Back to back like a suicide after ball practice
I'm back to back like Barry Bonds before the record shattered
Back to back, let me watch on myself, I'm all these actors
I don't need a bodyguard I should hire a chiropractor
Don't rap about guns, I never sold any drugs
I always told the truth, never lied about who I was
But never be confused, we come in twos, I'm not the one
And these days people think that I be rapping just for fun
Y'all must go to work and not get paid for it
Welch called my phone like, "Watch what you saying boy"
Ruff threw it up, I caught it off the backboard
If you ain't try to win then what you playing for?
God is in my court so ain't no point in boxing me
They try to tell me no just like no just like [?], why they blocking me?
Being nice is a choice I've made so don't act like I gotta be
And ironically I'm wasting time, concerned with people watching me
I'm sick of all the fake smiles and all the "I'm sorry"s
I'm took my time real slow man, no Ferrari
For all the years I stayed at home and didn't go party
Police jacket on like my name's Mike Lowry
We not the same and ain't no point in tryna be
I'm done with all the free samples, quit trying me
So many things that I keep locked inside of me
God it's getting hard to hold me back, cause honestly
I don't like it
You talk too much, shut up, be quiet
These are people that I can't stand, quit lying
I already know who I am, quit crying
It was understood, the king would throw us in the fire
Everybody preaching to the choir now
Been looking to the side and being quiet now
I made it through the fire still in one piece
Now everybody wanna be a part now
I had to tell the truth and now they mad at that
Yeah, they mad at that
99s not enough, I made another lap
After I win I hit the cabbage patch
I'm at my family reunion and they glad that I'm back
Yeah, they glad that I'm back
You should see their face when I tell them that I rap
Free Barabbas out, now go and download that
Aha
Stupid little boy
