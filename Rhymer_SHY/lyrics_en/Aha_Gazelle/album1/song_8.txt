[Intro: Aha Gazelle]
Ooh...Ooh...Ooh...
Yeah
Cool

[Chorus: Aha Gazelle]
Roni, I'm sorry
I played games, Sony
Ended the story
It made you a homie
But it ain't true, bologna
I act like you don't know me
But your inbox and phone log
Proves I'm a phoney
Remember, you told me
To choose what would hold me
I wanted a trophy
So I chose to be lonely
Now I got time, Roley
I'm still the whole me
Don't act like you don't know me
You know you know me
I thought that if I got cheese it would put her mind at ease
But she was indifferent to all of my shiny things
I was so confused
How could you not choose a king?
She says "You're no different for choosing to chase your dreams"
Ooh

[Verse: Aha Gazelle]
You pathetic
You, You hypocritic
You think that you deserve the credit
For the money that you gettin' nig-
You don't get it
Every word you said was fresh fresh fresh
I thought you peppermint it nig-
You was wastin' all my minutes while I was watching my weight
You had me eating lettuce nig-
I hope you still fell kinetic nig-
So just run away, no Giuseppe
There ain't no coming back to try at it
Ain't no making up, it ain't cosmetic
Hope the po-po pull you over and give you a ticket
All because the car is nicer than the person in it
Skrrt, Skrrt, homie
I hope you put you in the dirt homie
I can't believe you came back thinking you could fix it with a purse, homie
Don't try to come back after acting like you know me
Just forget to pass Kobe
Don't you try to make me laugh homie
Stop

[Chorus: Aha Gazelle]
Roni, I'm sorry
I played games, Sony
Ended the story
It made you a homie
But it ain't true, bologna
I act like you don't know me
But your inbox and phone log
Proves I'm a phoney
Remember, you told me
To choose what would hold me
I wanted a trophy
So I chose to be lonely
Now I got time, Roley
I'm still the old me
Don't act like you don't know me
You know you know me
I thought that if I got cheese it would put her mind at ease
But she was indifferent to all of my shiny things
I was so confused
How could you not choose a king?
She says "You're no different for choosing to chase your dreams"
Yeah

[Screwed Ending: Aha Gazelle]
You pathetic
You, You hypocritic
You think that you deserve the credit
For the money that you gettin' nig-
You don't get it
Every word you said was fresh fresh fresh
I thought you peppermint it
You was wastin' all my minutes while I was watching my weight
You had me eating lettuce nig-
I hope you still fell kinetic-netic-netic-netic
