[Intro: O. Nicole]
Once was blind

[Verse]
My brother Ben is off to college now
I didn't know how close we had really grown
I talk to God more often now so I don't feel alone
Not a lot red numbers on my phone
In I'm not popular
Never had a whole lot of followers
Only one in my fam who don't need glasses God gave me some binoculars
I can see the future and the future said why you playing games
You a nice rapper but a bad actor you gon' mess around and forget your name
You used to be a good super hero
Before the fans and before the fame
But now you flying over all the crowd for a pic on Instagram you a lame
I used to listen before the dreads when it was TrillWill and rubber band chains
Before "Aha" when it was just "Gazelle" with the baby dreads but you didn't complain
I used to love it when sung to me back when you said you couldn't sing
Now you sing in front everybody like you used to do it was you and me
You wrote a song called "You Still Remember" well I still remember everything
Remember when you put paper clips on the end of ya pants and called them skinny jeans
Remember when weren't ashamed of me and you said didn't care what anybody thinks
Remember the journal with your life goals you wrote 'em all down when you were 16
You wrote a song called staring contest about a chick that you don't even see
She moved away but if she had the chance to come and see you today what would she really think
Are you ashamed you had both parents and you went to church and ya dads a preacher
Are you ashamed of who you really are, are you ashamed that you believe in Jesus

[Bridge: Aha Gazelle & (O. Nicole)]
Why you tryna hide (why you tryna hide) it ain't no secret (it ain't no secret)
Why you playing dumb (why you playing dumb) I need you (I need you)
I know you had enough them ain't yo people
Who you hiding from I see you
Cool

[Hook: Aha Gazelle] (x2)
I once was blind but now I see
I got the power all up in me
My roof on fire I know you can't breathe
I got the hot sauce all over me

[Hook: O. Nicole] (x2)
I once was blind but now I see
I got the power all up in me
My roof on fire I know you can't breathe
I got the hot sauce all over me

[Outro: O. Nicole]
