[Intro]
Party number 3, last one let's go
Oh, best believe they still gon' ride
They wanna get off but I locked the doors
I'm finna make some people mad
I'mma tell the truth, though

[Verse 1]
Listen to this tale, no tattle
It started with the boats they put us on, no paddle
It started with the cotton that we picked, no raffle
That's why we look the freshest when we rock y'all apparel
God's gift to earth is why we all wanna be rappers
We the people really in the field, no tackle
We the people with the jump shot, no barrel
Million dollar contracts ain't free no pharaoh
We the people bad to the bone, no marrow
Pull up in foreign nah boy this ain't a Camaro
Tryna walk the straight line but the driveway narrow
Can't be a crybaby, only snakes have rattles
Got an index finger, I don't need a bow and arrow
Street beef will put ya in the grass, no cattle
Now we crying up in church singing "His Eye is On The Sparrow"
I hate funerals
Kings in the city, no Larry
Land of milk and honey, no dairy
Crib looking like a complex it's XXL
This ain't a little house on the prairie
We don't listen to Hillsong
Just Hilson, I want a girl like Keri
Cause girls just wanna have fun
And baby mamas just wanna get married
Do it all before we get buried
Same colour as a crow, but ain't nobody scary
I don't believe in magic but, I wish somebody would like a fairy
Money's not a medicine
Maybe I'm too negligent
Everybody's questioning while I'm dancing in my section with

[Pre-Hook]
Laura Winslow, Naomi Campbell
Them my kinfolk
Go Demarcus, do your dance
Cook it up and work your wrist bro
It ain't sinful to let your skin glow
If you ain't scared then what'd you flinch for?

[Hook]
It ain't our fault that you scared of the dark though
I'm black, I'm black
It ain't our fault that you scared of the dark though
I'm black, baby I'm black

[Post-Hook]
Hol' up, welcome to the All Black Party
With an uppercase B like Cardi
We like to get lit, not gnarly
We in their mouth like spit, no gargling
Welcome to the All Black Party
Look like a solar eclipse just started
We in their mouth like spit, no gargling
That's why a hater can't talk, Charles Barkley

[Verse 2]
Don't owe y'all no answers, don't have to explain
I'm fresh to deaf so there's nothing to say
You won't get an  answer, get out of my face
Cause you not my master, and I'm not your slave
Nobody put me on, cause I'm off the chain
I'm close to my goals like a five in the paint
Y'all some scarecrows cause y'all have no brain
That's why y'all afraid
Cool
Who the illest one you never seen with a cold
But cooler than some O's in a bowl of Cheerios
Not afraid to talk about how Jesus rose
And still have pretty girls in his music videos
When did beautiful women become a sin
I don't really think about it, to me it's common sense
I'm not an Indian but the feelings are real intense
These the same people who voted for Trump and Mike Pence
This ain't a fight about Christ
It's a fight about black against white who live way  different lives
And they say we ain't right because they don't get it
They not stupid, they just ign'ant to the pigment
(Wait I'm not finished)
Y'all don't control my market
So this dog keeps barking
Pretending like I ain't hot
Ignoring the fire I started
That's why my stock keeps rising
But my name ain't Martha because we don't snitch, I'm in the party with

[Pre-Hook]
Laura Winslow, Naomi Campbell
Them my kinfolk
Go Demarcus, do your dance
Cook it up and work your wrist bro
It ain't sinful to let your skin glow
If you ain't scared then what'd you flinch for?

[Hook]
It ain't our fault that you scared of the dark though
It ain't our fault that you scared of the dark though

[Post-Hook]
Hol' up, welcome to the All Black Party
With an uppercase B like Cardi
We like to get lit, not gnarly
We in their mouth like spit, no gargling
Welcome to the All Black Party
Look like a solar eclipse just started
We in their mouth like spit, no gargling
That's why a hater can't talk, Charles Barkley

[Bridge]
It's all I want, it's all I need
It's everything you was to me
It's all I want, it's all I need
It's everything you was to me

[Outro: Reg Rob]
Uhh, y'all still here?
Yea, this is kinda weird
Uh, it's over kinda sorta, well it's really officially over
I mean we gave you Trilliam 1, then we gave you the sequel, Trill 2
Then we gave you the trilogy, Trilliam 3
That's Trill Trill Trill Trill 3
Don't you get it? Did you go to school?
I don't know, I don't- aye whatever
Look, don't #Trill4, it's not happening
It's over with, done done done, finito, dead
Aye, but I can tell you one thing
I can't save you
Huyeaah
(Yo, can I try that again with some autotune?)
