[Verse 1]
Your reflection in my wine glass
That's when I look away
Can't stand to think about losing your fine ass
How the fuck I let you slip away?
Life of the party, but I'm dead inside
Killed my vibes, it was genocide
Hard to act like I've been alive
I'm tryna find where I identify
One time for the girl that got away
Two times for the bub I'm about to spray
Three times for the power that I pray to
Are you up there? Can you hear me?
I know I fucked up it's clear, see
I'm 22 but I don't act like it, clearly
And all this shit is a mirage
I'm just rapping for a cause
That life, the fame that lights the game
We break the laws, don't like to change
Want to win you back, but I hate to lose
I know that you're the one, but it's hard to choose

[Pre-Hook: LÉON]
And all these lies they keep on slippin' out
I said I don't believe that you just passed out on the couch

[Hook: LÉON (Skizzy Mars)]
Cause I've been nothing but good to you
(And I ain't done the same girl)
Your howlin' into the night won't do
Cause I've been nothing but good to you
(And I ain't done the same girl)
Your howlin' into the night won't do

[Verse 2]
Look, too much whiskey in my red cup
Remember first date you wouldn't give it up
We had only scratched the surface
But I knew that you were worth it
Yeah, yeah, so I was patient
I bragged to my niggas Joe Namath
I'm still with the niggas that I came with
But everything changed once some fame hit
Make it up, take you down
Have a shot, I bought a round
Play my song, you like the sound
It's going down, it's going down
Let's drink coffee, watch passerbys
And prove to you I'm not the average guy
It's just my flaws that they magnify
And when it's real, you don't have to try

[Pre-Hook: LÉON]
And all these lies they, keep on slippin' out
I said I don't believe that you just passed out on the couch

[Hook: LÉON (Skizzy Mars)]
Cause I've been nothing but good to you
(And I ain't done the same girl)
Your howlin' into the night won't do
Cause I've been nothing but good to you
(And I ain't done the same girl)
Your howlin' into the night won't do

[Bridge]
I wish there was another way
Tomorrow is another day
Drugs take the pain away
Sometimes I wanna run away
I wish there was another way
Tomorrow is another day
Drugs take the pain away
Sometimes I wanna run away

[Hook: LÉON (Skizzy Mars)]
I've been nothing but good to you
(And I ain't done the same girl)
Your howlin' into the night won't do
Cause I've been nothing but good to you
(And I ain't done the same girl)
Your howlin' into the night won't do
