[Verse 1: Skizzy Mars]
Skizzy the iconoclast, she got all kinds of ass
Smoking all kinds of grass, now I got more time to pass
You rappers kind of crass, But I'm that new-new
Blunt making ash, call that shit my Pikachu-chu
So what you want to do-do, me and ya girl on oovoo
I'm up in ATL and I am only bagging new news
Never beef, Moo Shu, leather Tod's new shoes
Labels send me mail and I get hype like its blues clues
And I'mma keep spittin' till I stop dippin'
And I'mma keep pimpin' till y'all stop trippin'
Chilling with my n-words, say it like a white kid
Live life on the edge like I got two weeks and I might live
I might kid, I might hit, Hermés I like it
Grey Goose was injured thats why we went and iced it
Told that girl, that's tall, I'm forward if you want it
We on the ball like Chris Paul for the hornets
Cause girl the way you flaunt it
Got me so attracted
Black girl with green eyes
Yeah, that's what I call a bad bitch
Vanessa hudgens type bitch is what I'm fucking
And I leave the scene right after I cut it man its nothing
Gambino had the track so I followed it
Y'all niggas twittered motherfuckers always following
I make new moves I make new rules
And then I break them like new shoes
Me and penthouse music thats the new school
Chrome hearts my new jewels
Model chicks the usual
Chilling out and backing up would be what the prudent do
You ain't a boss, so I never get used to you
And I'mma make it I'mma make it give me three years
And your girl, mmm, maybe after three beers
Patron made it so its hard for me to see clear
You couldn't catch me if all your years were leap years
Uh, Sometimes I wonder if I'm moving too fast
And then I pour more cranberry and vodka in my glass
You need bars well we got several here
I'm trying to make some hits every year and do it for several years
Coast to mexico, Rolex is crystal clear
Bitches love us, there boyfriends wanna fuck us, up
But all there girlfriends wanna...

Charlie sheen talking

[Verse 2: Skizzy Mars]

I don't know fuck your X-man
Baby girl you coming home with me
Fuck you on the throne because I'm the fucking king
And we ain't talking wedding rings
I'm trying to die alone so when I wake up in the morn baby you should be
Gone kicks Y-3, Oriental wifey
Beds is on the west side, you know we getting Hyphie
Oh, Shout out to union
Yeah you know we do it
Codiene out of cups that are a little translucent
Yeah, We on the up so I'm a little boastful
I know I'm fly baby but I struggle to approach you
Insecure little teenager at school dances
Now I call at four in the morning all these bitches answer
Canada goose vest keeps me warm when it's frigid
Spit ill when I'm angry, right now im fucking livid
They say I'm immature, wait I was fucking kidding
They say I'm bipolar, I say I'm bi-winning
Shorty used to be chubby but now her thighs spinning
BBM me late night, You know that I'm in it
Take my jesus piece off whenever I'm sinning
Because I tend to do stupid shit whenever I'm ginning
Uh-uh I did it and I'mma do it now
And all my doubters you lookin' real stupid now
And all my x-girls you lookin' real foolish now
And truth is I'm the greatest to ever do this shit
Shit, tiger blood when I get a cut
And, she ain't offended when I hit her butt
And, I ain't pretending im the shit but
I'm confident shes coming over when I hit her up
Shes like: "you skiz the rapper? oh my gosh!"
I said: "i'm skiz the rapper and I got cosh!"
Wait, I'm not rapper I prefer a poet
You wanna make it in this business baby show it
Show the possibilites then look in her face girl I buy you some real louis you know that purse fake
She smiles and slowly sips her cup
Girl this dinner is in hopes that you will give it up
Peronis for my homies
Aloha to my broha's
Chillin' in Hawaii drop the thou at barney's co-op
Misty skies from the penthouse I hardly see
Palm trees, high off this drug called Charlie Sheen

[Hook:]
