[Verse 1: Skizzy Mars]
You whistle and I sing
We're both happy like bright parks and the high swings
Weathers crappy you want love
I want flings, scared of commitment
You like me, I like things materialistic, so
What the fuck is this?
I don’t know, I am just a kid with a talent
Trying to make it big, so work and love, I balance
With a soft spot for those blue eye girls that act condescending
Make remarks that are offending
Ooh, I love those girls and the ones that are naive
They think I love them and I'm faithful when I'm lying through my teeth
Yeah, and the ones that act so differently around me
And they do with their friends
Girl you don’t have to pretend, just be
Who you are, I probably won't like it
When I'm big, all my ex girls who wanna be reunited
I ain't down in slightest trying to meet the girl with the fattest ass or the jeans that fit the tightest
Ooh, I think I found her
I'm gonna make sure she gets knighted
And even when I kick her out that girl be so delighted

[Pre-Chorus: Skizzy Mars]
I told her like
"Quit thinking"
I've been drinking
She cold, I'mma get the mink in
Get the mink out
I wonder when you die what you think about (4x)

[Chorus: The Chemical Brothers]
Another world surround me
Another heart will forgive
Another world will surround me
Another heart will forgive

[Verse 2: Skizzy Mars]
She says we have been dating for while
She says we should settle down
I say "hell no"
I am having too much fun to consider that
Call for security, don’t fuck with that
The party and the fun I deliver that
I get love don't give it back
Let’s do what they do on Cinemax
Life is never wasted when you wasted all the time(2x)

[ Bridge 1: Skizzy Mars](2x)
Boozin', confusin', faded, we're moving
You hot as hell, Jacuzzi'n
Charlie Sheen, my main girl losing

Another world will surround me
(Main girl losing)
Another heart will forgive

[Bridge 2: Skizzy Mars](2x)
Easy come easy go
I tell my English friends, I fancy all these easy hoes
Which one to chose, Eenie Moe
But I don’t love you anymore

[Outro: Skizzy Mars]
Let’s do what they do on Cinemax
I get love don’t give it back
Let’s do what they do on Cinemax
I get love don’t give it back
Let’s do what they do on Cinemax
I get love don’t give it back
