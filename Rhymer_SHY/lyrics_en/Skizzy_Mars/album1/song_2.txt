[Intro]
Yeah
I like the
I like the vibe of this one, Mikey
I like the way this shit sounds
Yeah
Vibes

[Verse 1]
Sorry, Mom, I been a bad son
And I ain't talking throwing tantrums
I just came off a bad run
Common sense, wish I had some
They say insanity is doing the same thing
Over and over and expecting results to change
My mind strange
They say if nothing change, nothing changes
There's things in my life that need rearranging
I tend to speak a lot, but I rarely listen
Maybe it's time I make some good decisions
And to my ex girl still tryna listen
I know I contribute to your current position

[Chorus]
Yeah, I let it ring when she call me a couple times
Make sure that she love me and she still mine
Don't be talking to no dudes while I'm out of town
Don't be talking to no dudes while I'm not around
Let it ring when she call me a couple times
Make sure that she love me and she still mine
Don't be talking to no dudes while I'm out of town
Don't be talking to no dudes while I'm not around

[Verse 2]
There's some issues I still need to dig in
That place called heaven I'm still tryna get in
I'm tryna change it up, I'm tryna straighten up
Don't mean to bring this up, but Caitlin might've been the one
How the fuck I mess that up?
I hope she doing well
Remember buying you those shades up at YSL
And last year on the road, way too many hoes
Nights I don't remember, had a lot of those
Needed pills to play, now in the hills we stay
I'm tryna switch it up, tryna live a different way
That was a different me, that was a different time
Lil' mama insecure, but she know she fine

[Chorus]
Yeah, I let it ring when she call me a couple times
Make sure that she love me and she still mine
Don't be talking to no dudes while I'm out of town
Don't be talking to no dudes while I'm not around
Let it ring when she call me a couple times
Make sure that she love me and she still mine
Don't be talking to no dudes while I'm out of town
Don't be talking to no dudes while I'm not around

[Verse 3]
When the last time I called grams?
I been popping these 2 milligrams
And Chelsea bought the kid the new Saint Laurents
I ain't even take that hoe to lunch
Accept the things I can't change, Ima do some new things
Ima buy that new Range
Posted with my boo thang
Sorry, honey, I ain't call you
Hate when my obligations fall through
Everybody got addictions
Man I had some crazy nights
Woke up in crazy positions
With no recollection
But
How long can this shit last?
When the plug got my back when I'm low on cash
Slowed it down for a minute
It was moving fast
My accountant doing taxes, having heart attacks
That was a different me, that was a different time
Lil' mama insecure, but she know she fine

[Chorus]
Yeah, I let it ring when she call me a couple times
Make sure that she love me and she still mine
Don't be talking to no dudes while I'm out of town
Don't be talking to no dudes while I'm not around
Let it ring when she call me a couple times
Make sure that she love me and she still mine
Don't be talking to no dudes while I'm out of town
Don't be talking to no dudes while I'm not around
