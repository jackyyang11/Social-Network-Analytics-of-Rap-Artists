[Hook]
And I've been putting days in
And they got me in the Days Inn
And the shit that I've been making is amazing
And things are moving fast, it's changing
Working all week, no breaks, it was crazy
Deadlines, deadlines they will never trade me
Come through the crib and be lazy
Come through the crib and be lazy with me

[Verse 1]
We can watch Netflix
Or we can just have sex
I know I hit your room mate
But don't worry that was last year
Always caught up in the past shit
Lay up line, she was practice
Apple TV put on a good show
She got the number for the good blow
I smoke a lot you can probably tell
Pop a perc now I'm high as hell
Neighbors getting annoyed by the smell
Fuck it though, fuck em' know
You and me we can go anywhere we want to go
These niggas so unoriginal
I'll tell you anything you wanna know

[Hook]
And I've been putting days in
And they got me in the Days Inn
And the shit that I've been making is amazing
And things are moving fast, it's changing
Working all week, no breaks, it was crazy
Deadlines, deadlines they will never trade me
Come through the crib and be lazy
Come through the crib and be lazy with me

[Verse 2]
She like, she like what you working with
Well I got the Xanax and the Percocet
We can really vibe out
I've been in the studio
Gotta take some time out
Bad bitch put her on time out
Stole her dad's Jaguar hope he doesn't find out
We ordered in we don't dine out
First to cut, cut the line, then she cut the line out
And you know yo got my contact
When you ever need that
Tell the door man the penthouse
We stacking more green than the weed guy
And you know that shit loud too
And my pops say he proud too
Now he tell me get some bitches for the table
I was like "Ok I'll bring back two."

[Hook]
And I've been putting days in
And they got me in the Days Inn
And the shit that I've been making is amazing
And things are moving fast, it's changing
Working all week, no breaks, it was crazy
Deadlines, deadlines they will never trade me
Come through the crib and be lazy
Come through the crib and be lazy with me

[Bridge]
Be lazy, be lazy with me
Be lazy, be lazy baby
Be lazy ooh ooh ooh
Be lazy

[Hook]
And I've been putting days in
And they got me in the Days Inn
And the shit that I've been making is amazing
And things are moving fast, it's changing
Working all week, no breaks, it was crazy
Deadlines, deadlines they will never trade me
Come through the crib and be lazy
Come through the crib and be lazy with me
