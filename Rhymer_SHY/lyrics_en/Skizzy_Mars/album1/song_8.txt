[Verse 1: Skizzy Mars]
Got two bad tings and they simultaneous
Welcome to the life of a rich and famous kid
Thought I had feelings, she was incorrect
I paid my dues and I earned respect
Fuck your arenas
Ferragamos from Bergdorf
We coming in first not second, third form
Heart's unbreakable, mind unshakable
Girls come and go but the mind stay stable
Uptown kid with the view from the penthouse
Can't smoke then we dipped out, clean when we step out
All black with a 10, she don't speak much
Valley girl from the hills, she dont eat much
Big Pimpin' my theme song
It's right even though it may seem wrong
My mama told me you a king son
So I'm just gon' be one
Homie

[Chorus: Chose]
I told you I'm too pimpin'
You tried to get me I was too distant
You can't treat me like the other niggas
'Cause
I fuck bitches and burn bridges
I fuck bitches and burn bridges
I fuck bitches and burn bridges

[Verse 2: Skizzy Mars]
They talk a lot of shit but they rarely back it up
Come through happy but she leave, mad as fuck
Phone blowing up vibratin' on the bed
I don't want an argument I really want some head
Shit will go down if I don't get my money fast enough
Feelin' on her ass enough
She say I'm too crass and rough
And I just keep my speakers knocking
Too faded to dap you up
Three girls at the same club, can I pull it off
In a bra now, can you pull it off
Grew up on a rock get stoned cold
I keep it stone cold, I don't love no hoes, problem solved
Ever wonder why I only call you passed 2 in the morning
Cause I know you'll always come through when I want it

[Chorus: Chose]
I told you I'm too pimpin'
You tried to get me I was too distant
You can't treat me like the other niggas
'Cause
I fuck bitches and burn bridges
I fuck bitches and burn bridges
I fuck bitches and burn bridges

[Verse 3: Skizzy Mars]
Yeah, I'm not these dudes that you see
That be unwilling to leave
I got some options a couple of opportunities
I be willing to see, multiple women are coming at me
At a vociferous speed
Maybe too fast I don't know
Never knew how to go slow
Never knew how to just be alone
Maybe I need some time just move along
Maybe this drink is too strong
Maybe you'll never move on

[Chorus: Chose]
I told you I'm too pimpin'
You tried to get me I was too distant
You can't treat me like the other niggas
'Cause
I fuck bitches and burn bridges
I fuck bitches and burn bridges
I fuck bitches and burn bridges
