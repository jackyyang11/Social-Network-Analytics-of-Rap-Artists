[Verse 1: Skizzy Mars]
Yeah we think we're grown ups
But really we're just growing up
Yeah we think we know it all
But really we don't know enough
Hanging off the balconies, hoping she not throwing up
Kissed her and I said, I don't believe in no love
Uh, fast money no slow bucks, label can't control us
We chasing perfection, penthouse so they know whats up

[Hook: Skizzy Mars]
Summer got shorter, the leaves started falling and turning the Autumn the whole handles gone
We're just alcoholics guess that's what you call it
Start in July don't stop until August you mixing
With pills and the gnac that's what we call it, we alcoholics
Alcoholics
I said I quit drinking I done lied baby I'm a alcoholic
I'm drinking all night till the sunrise, baby
I'm an alcoholics
And you know my cup fill got low eyes that's no lie
Alcoholics
I'm tryna change ways but its so hard to do right tonight (tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)

[Verse 2: Skizzy Mars]
Stuck in the city, humid as fuck
I might catch the jetty, this cuban come with me
Fuck his phone must be missing
My ex girl is trippin
I mean non existent
I might take a trip to Jamaica for distance having preminitions

[Hook: Skizzy Mars]
Summer got shorter, the leaves started falling and turning the Autumn the whole handles gone
We're just alcoholics guess that's what you call it

With pills and the gnac thats what we call it, we alcoholics
Alcoholics
I said I quit drinking I done lied baby I'm a alcoholics

And you know my cup fill got low eyes that's no lie

I'm tryna change ways but its so hard to do right tonight

[Bridge: Skizzy Mars]
I got prescriptions and I need to fill 'em
I got some demons and I need to kill 'em
Blow got her numb, she need to feel it
Fuck this facade, Man I need some real shit

[Hook: Skizzy Mars]
Alcoholics
I said I quit drinking I done lied baby I'm a alcoholics
I'm drinking all night till the sunrise, baby

And you know my cup fill got low eyes that's no lie

We drank, we drank all night
And don't remember anything
I know that you're alright
I hope that you're
