[Lyrics from both Music Mafia and alternate provided snippets]

[Verse 1]
You might not survive with me (come and get high)
She ready to die with me
Girl I need you beside me (you by my side)
She come though and set the vibe, for me
Make a promise, she won't lie to me (would you lie?)
Confide in you and you confide in me, yeah
If I need dope she gon' provide for me, yeah
I just hope that she won't lie to me

[Hook]
Tell the truth, how many pills did you pop yesterday?
Sent my plug a Uber, got some drank on the way
I took 2 and plus the 4 I pop yesterday
You just kissed that girl, she sucked me off yesterday
I used to sweep the floor, now people cleaning up my plates
Me and Danny boy was smoking blunts with the maid
