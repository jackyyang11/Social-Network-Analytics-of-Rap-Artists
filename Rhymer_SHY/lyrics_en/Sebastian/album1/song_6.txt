Folarin, Double M, G
Slip N' Slide collabo
Let's get it!

What you talking bout?
Know I've been to Roma
Well let me call you out
When you put your crown
You got a little style
Let me put it down
Until you walking on the cloud
Look, the time's now, I'm intrigued
Whenever I browse
I'll be sure you get things
Yeah, see what I did there
Slip inside of her body
Until she get there

I can't lie, when I
Watch my baby
Her lip gloss pop, just came from the spot
Hair done too
But girl that was four shots ago
Now you can't believe
That you didn't feel me
Cause you wasn't sayin' that last night

Girl, I swear to God
People pay for a smile likes yours
And I'm loving it, cheaa (and I'm loving it, I'm loving it)
Girl, I swear to God
They'll pay for ass like yours if it wasn't there, yeah, yeah
(and I'm rubbing it, I'm rubbing it)

You wanna know if we can make this confidential
Between me and you
(we already did it)
Between me and you
(we already did it)
Remember when I said
I'm tryna find something to get into
I was talkin' 'bout you
(we already did it)
I was talking about you, you, you, you, you

I can't lie, when I
Watch my baby
Her lip gloss pop, just came from the spot
Hair done too
But girl that was four shots ago
Now you can't believe
That you didn't feel me
Cause you wasn't sayin' that last night

This ain't real baby
What they talking bout
Ain't no rapper that's alive call Folarin out
Now can you deal with it?
I'll probably win you out
Cause I never tell a woman
Where my body call
Lemme tell 'bout last night
I don't remember much of last night
How I can say it keeping it polite
Ummmm, you left once, but she came twice
So get it right

I can't lie, when I
Watch my baby
Her lip gloss pop, just came from the spot
Hair done too
But girl that was four shots ago
Now you can't believe
That you didn't feel me
Cause you wasn't sayin' that last night

I swear to God
And I promise I won't tell nobody
Your privacy is safe with me
(and I'm loving it, I'm loving it)
Girl I swear to God
I wanna get plenty time to touch you
(and I'm rubbing it, I'm rubbing it)

You wanna know if we can make this confidential
Between me and you
