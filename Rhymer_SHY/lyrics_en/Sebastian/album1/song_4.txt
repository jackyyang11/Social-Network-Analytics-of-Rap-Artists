(Feat. Mayer Hawthorne)
All my senses are on fire
30 feet above the floor
Only wanna get you higher
Higher than we’ve been before

Love in motion
Love in motion

Dancing on a telephone wire
Amplifiers all aglow
Push it till the walls perspire
Bullets raining down below

Love in motion
Yeah yeah, love in motion

Supersonic snowglobe
Spinnin' stronger than you hear
We can take it Uptown
Swinging from the chandelier
No one gives a damn about the neighbors
So we carry on into the night
A thousand echoing elations elevate us
Send me swimming into the light

Love in motion
Yeah yeah, love in motion
Love In motion
Is all I want
