[Chorus: M.I.A.]
You better C.T.F.O., chill the fuck out
'Cause this is swerving now, you’re a road block
I'm all about it, wired and routed
You say I'm trying it? You're busy buying it

[Verse 1: M.I.A.]
The judges in the world fucked up tomorrow
But I still don't know what I'm s'posed to know
I read your friends blog, saw you with the club
The jeans you had on, remove your painted top
If you fall, will you, I just keep on
Your market researcher makes me bleed more
Don’t know what to say, everything's hearsay
But I need lotta G's, just make it through my day

[Chorus: M.I.A.]
You better C.T.F.O., chill the fuck out
'Cause this is swerving now, you’re a road block
I'm all about it, wired and routed
You say I'm trying it? You're busy buying it
You better C.T.F.O., chill the fuck out
'Cause this is swerving now, you’re a road block
I'm all about it, wired and routed
You say I'm trying it? You're busy buying it

[Verse 2: M.I.A.]
The judges in the world fucked up tomorrow
But I still don't know what I'm s'posed to know
I read your friends blog, saw you with the club
The jeans you had on, remove your painted top
If you fall, will you, I just keep on
Your market researcher makes me bleed more
Don’t know what to say, everything's hearsay
But I need lotta G's, just make it through my day

[Chorus: M.I.A.]
You better C.T.F.O., chill the fuck out
'Cause this is swerving now, you’re a road block
I'm all about it, wired and routed
You say I'm trying it? You're busy buying it
You better C.T.F.O., chill the fuck out
'Cause this is swerving now, you’re a road block
I'm all about it, wired and routed
You say I'm trying it? You're busy buying it
