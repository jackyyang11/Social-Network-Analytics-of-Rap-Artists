[Intro]
I’m on I’m on till ya give me no more
Still, I’m ready, even if I don’t go
Baby girl I’m still on and on since I popped out the hole
Still, I’m ready if I don’t go

[Verse 1]
Said
I’m naked down to my socks
Bitch I’m Anthony Kiedis
All this Charmin I got
Put that right to your sneezer
Ride around on my block
VTA 2K Teasey (2K Teasey)
Fuck the police -
Okay back to my thesis
Hoes don’t love ‘em, don’t treat ‘em
I just teach ‘em to stroke ‘em
Pass that over to LODEF
He gon’ pass it to Jose
He gon’ lend it, Mikos
Okay bases are loaded
Then she make it to Parker
She MVP with the trophy
Like Eric Wright with the shotty
Curtis May with the fender
Flava Flav wit the clock
I had no time to play pitcher
You niggas acting like goalies
Yous a hatin’ defender
I stay on Ps and Qs
Since the top of my sentence

[Chorus]
And I’m ready
If I don’t go
Don’t go
Don’t go
I’m ready
Don’t go
Don’t go
Don’t
Motherfucker, I’m ready

[Verse 2]
They oughta know
They oughta see
How you feeling, Uhhh! That's that Master P! (It's that Master P)
Did you roll or make it mine (Make your mind up)
We stay whole and you can wind (You can wind up)
Pick on the floorda, they gonna pop that cola
Bitch niggas wanna roll up, bitch nigga here get rolled up
Slow motion watch me bend that corner (Bend that corner)
Slow motion let she give me more, muh

[Verse 3]
I can’t stand what you got
Girl your ass is Movado
I can’t help but to watch
Collard greens in my pot
All these clouds I think I finally see the top

[Chorus]
And motherfucker, I’m ready
If I don’t go
I don’t go
I don’t go
I don’t go
I’m ready
If I don’t go
If I don’t go
If I don’t go
Motherfucker, I’m ready
I don’t go
I’m ready
If I don’t go
If I don’t go
I’m ready

[Outro]
If you got a problem we can light it up
Light it up, we can light it up
If you got a problem we can light it up
Light it up, we can light it up
If you got a problem we can light it up
Light it up, we can light it up
If you got a problem we can light it up
Light it up, we can light it up
