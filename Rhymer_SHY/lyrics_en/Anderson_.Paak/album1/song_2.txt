[Hook]
If you wonder how I do
In the right place
With the left hand
On the wrong time
There are no mistakes don't get it confused
Was it my fault?

[Verse 1]
Fuck that I'm losing my cool
I know that's not your cousin you think I'm a fool
See, drive three hours to kick it with you
Now I'm 'bout to catch a case for killing this dude
Look me in the eye say it ain't true
Tell me what I did, what I didn't do
What could turn a woman that cynical?
Was you really that miserable?
Wouldn't believe all the pussy I passed up
I was saying I'm loyal they were saying I'm gassed up
Shit I feel like a clown, I feel like a damn shmuck
Racking my brain I remember the small subtleties
All in my face, talking 'bout how you was in love with me
How could you love another one, no-one could ever fuck with me
I let you meet my mother, cooked you food when you was hungry

[Hook]
If you wonder how I do
In the right place
With the left hand
On the wrong time (Don't fucking touch me!)
There are no mistakes don't get it confused
Was it my fault?

[Verse 2]
Who's mine
Call me if you wanna call me
I'm already leaving
Headed out the driveway
Once I've found my keys in
The weathers looking mighty fine this evening
Hope you excited to see me
Got a new t-shirt, expensive cologne
I got a fresh haircut, new socks and drawers
I waited all week for you
As I'm rolling up my reefa...there's something wrong

[Verse 3]
Remember dude with red bottom shoes walking out your front door
I rolled my window down (Who the fuck is this clown?)
No need for reaction
On how did this here happen
It's now all in my [inaudible]
Never seen it coming
Wasn't even watching

[Hook]
If you wonder how I do
In the right place
With the left hand
On the wrong time
There are no mistakes don't get it confused
Was it my fault?
