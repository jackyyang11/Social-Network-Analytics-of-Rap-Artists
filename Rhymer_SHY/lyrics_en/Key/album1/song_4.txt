[Hook]
I got hoes like eeny meeny moe now
Lately I been tunnel vision, bolt down
Yeah I got some money but want some more now
And I'm living life fast and I won't slow down
And I don't want to say your name, it'll bring you fame
Yeah she gave me face, didn't know her name
I just got a check and it was blank
Flooded out my Rollie it was plain

[Verse 1]
Right now man I'm high as Ayatollah
Still in The 6 doing donuts
Two coffee cups but no Folgers
Don't step out of line, I thought I told ya
Alexander Wang where the thirty hang
You is just a stain, got no stain, you can't fuckin' hang
Left the bags of napalm, we all go to [?]
Ski mask on a nigga, they ain't notice us

[Pre-Chorus]
Money come and go, I can tell you that
Gang of petty hoes and they all bad
Greedy young nigga, I need all that
I get what I want, then fall back

[Chorus]
I got hoes like eeny meeny moe now
Lately I been tunnel vision, bolt down
Yeah I got some money but want some more now
And I'm living life fast and I won't slow down
And I don't want to say your name, it'll bring you fame
Yeah she gave me face, didn't know her name
I just got a check and it was blank
Flooded out my Rollie, it was plain

[Verse 2]
I got hoes like eeny meeny moe now
Lately I been tunnel vision, bolt down
Ay I got some money, now want more now
Living life fast and I won't slow down
I got pretty bitches playin' with they nose
Intercept a play, I'm talking give and go
I will never let up off they neck, no
I was ballin' hard and caught a tech, woah

[Pre-Chorus]
Money come and go, I can tell you that
Gang of petty hoes and they all bad
Greedy young nigga, I need all that
I get what I want, then fall back

[Chorus]
I got hoes like eeny meeny moe now
Lately I been tunnel vision, bolt down
Yeah I got some money but want some more now
And I'm living life fast and I won't slow down
And I don't want to say your name, it'll bring you fame
Yeah she gave me face, didn't know her name
I just got a check and it was blank
Flooded out my Rollie, it was plain
