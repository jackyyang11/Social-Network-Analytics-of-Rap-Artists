[Verse 1]
My bitch bad, I treat her average though
Trap bunkin' hard, bitch who at the door?
Them people at the window, they gon' hide the dope
You're looking for a lick, I bet you find the floor
I got 'bout 75 in my denims
Asian bitch with me, I'm like John Lennon
A lot of niggas starting to act like women
I really think they mad cause they not winnin'
My money long, it's gon' last forever
My bitch thick, she got ass forever
Niggas hatin' on me gon' be mad forever
I just beat the game, I just passed the level

[Hook]
38 hot, plus my face hot
38 hot, plus my face hot
38 hot, plus my face hot
38 hot, plus my face hot
Throw the work out
Throw the work out
Throw the work out
38 hot
Throw the work out
Throw the work out
Throw the work out
38 hot

[Verse 2]
I'm not just a local pedestrian
Baby I'm hot as the oven
I'm [?] all on my feet
Right now man I'm not in the country
Tired of talkin' 'bout lean
Putting dick in her spleen
Ooh baby, not the couch
Work stuffed inside the couch
Guinness book of world records
Getting world recognition
Stupid head, she gifted
Blowing gas, I'm lifted
I'm making plays in the field
In the field you ain't here
In the field, John Deere
Summer '16 our year

[Hook]
38 hot, plus my face hot
38 hot, plus my face hot
38 hot, plus my face hot
38 hot, plus my face hot
Throw the work out
Throw the work out
Throw the work out
38 hot
Throw the work out
Throw the work out
Throw the work out
38 hot
