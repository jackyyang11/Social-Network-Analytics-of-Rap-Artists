[Intro]
Hit 'em with the .45 [8x]

Take it and make it whatever the fuck you want it to be

[Verse 1]
Hit 'em with the .45, hit 'em with the .45
But this here is justified
Niggas making ho moves
Out here telling whole lies
Known this bitch his whole life
Friends killing friends, boy I know the devil is a lie
Then I let his ho slide
You was calling, we was fucking
Fucking up the whole vibe
Rambo, I got a handle made out of rubber
Listening to Chad, hitting it on top of the covers
Moving like [?]
In the house, smoked out, on the couch, getting wild
Getting wild, what's wild?
Bitch i'm talking 'bout the top
Open up, let me in
Ain't no nigga better than, young nigga veteran
Fuck 'em all, i'm going in

Hit 'em with the .45

[Verse 2]
He leaking, now he bleeding, in need of treatment
Pussy, this nigga pussy, i'm 'bout to douche him
Gush 'em, come scoop him
Crank engine getaways, man i'm 'bout to lose 'em

[Outro]
Come on let's hit 'em with the .45
Come on, let's hit 'em with the .45
I had to hit 'em with the .45
Had to do it, hit 'em with the .45
