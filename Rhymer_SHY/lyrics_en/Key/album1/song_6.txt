[Verse 1: Omari Shakir]
Let me tell you bout a nigga like me
Sike ain't no nigga like me
Black boots stomp on ya Nikes
Late night chillin' wit'cha wifey
She like loud and cohibas
Loud in the speaker
She loud when I freak her, and tweak her and eat her
Man I don't go there
Bitch if I go there
Pullin on her hair
Or pulling it somewhere
In different cities
Mari sign titties
But still act sadity
These women too pretty
2 bumps of the Whitney got her head on Bobby
She does it so sloppy
Turnin up probably
All on the couches
Like who the fuck house is
I'm kickin' out spouses
Wet spots on yo bitch couch
When you gone that's my house
Trappin' out a condo
Shot 'em and they found home
Yo bitch wipin' down my firearm
I'm Outta Pocket when I fire arm

[Hook]
Fuck 'em
Imma smoke this blunt to the face
Fuck 'em
Imma take a nigga bitch and get face
Fuck 'em
A nigga might wanna save face
Fuck 'em
All this paper in they God damn face
Fuck 'em
Fuck 'em
Fuck 'em
Fuck 'em
Fuck 'em
Fuck 'em
Fuck 'em
Fuck 'em
Fuck 'em

[Verse 2: ManMan Savage]
Fuck 'em
I got too many bullets can't duck 'em
Fuck 'em
I got too many hoes can't love 'em
Fuck 'em
*Pew pew* nigga can't duck 'em
Fuck 'em
Got'cha man bitch wanna fuck me
Got'cha man bitch wanna fuck me
Fucked her one time now she love me
Watch me finna hit em with the dougie
Trap money got me living lovely
Still walk around wit' da pot
Serving these chickens like Church's
Watch how I pull out the lot
Swerve off on 'em on purpose
My young niggas shootin' shit on purpose
I wanna fuck her she a virgin
I swear to God this molly workin'
I swear I bout to have it rockin'

[Hook]
