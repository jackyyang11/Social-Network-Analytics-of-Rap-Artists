[Verse 1: Mozzy]
Child of the trenches, I’m a gang member
VVS, frostbites on the chain, nigga
Walk up on him, introduce the K nigga
Like a blood where I'm from, what he say, nigga?
I sold onions at the market with my Tre niggas
And respect the dope fiends, I used to stay with him
You know the usalama on 'em, gotta stay with him
Knock ya stupid ass down, try to play with him
My niggas in the streets, really out the trenches
We up and poppin' niggas, fuck the opposition
We up and poppin' niggas, fuck the opposition
Leave your facials half full, very optimistic
I'm not listening, rock glistening
Ask yo bitch about the Mozzy, we the top niggas
We poppin' up at all these shows just to pop niggas
I don't adopt, niggas, you are not squad, nigga

[Chorus: Yhung T.O.]
And that's why I gotta keep a ratchet, bad bitch
Work two jobs and get taxes
Bought a new Glock, hold 30, like a plasma
All she want is two things, back shots and back rubs
And oh I, oh I
I'm that nigga that'll do that
And oh I can't lie, love the way that you move that
You know, know I
Get that check and move through that
Got one clip, two clips, niggas know I can shoot that stick

[Verse 2: Slimmy B]
MCM backpack, lil nigga back back
Fuck where there ass at, bitch, where that cash at?
Ride when we smoking, lil dope, we don't mash that
Any sucker nigga sliding through getting clapped out
House lick, we running through that bitch like it's fast track
Remember all them days I was broke, but I'm past that
Get the job done when I'm busting, I don't backtrack
Hit his Glock with them chops out like it's Baghdad
Shooter like Mad Max, leave a nigga stretched out
All headshots dumb nigga, put that vest down
Beat the pussy up like a young nigga fresh out
Thugging with them TEC's out, I'll bring them jets out
Niggas up on the kid, I'll bust a nigga head
Seven point six twos knockin' off a nigga's dreads
Money on my mind, all I think about bread
And tell your bitch get off my dick, she keeps tryna give me head
A bunch of young niggas sick with it like 40
350 Yeezy Boosts, nigga these ain't Roshes
On my bag flow, I'm tryna bust down a Rollie
My son, mom everything, I treat 'em like a trophy
Pour two fours of that that yellow,  no Kobe
Got OG's that'll still shoot like Ginobili
A band for my coat like I live where the snow be
Bitch I'm from the Crest where shit gets funky, nigga

[Chorus: Yhung T.O.]
And that's why I gotta keep a ratchet, bad bitch
Work two jobs and get taxes
Bought a new Glock, hold 30, like a plasma
All she want is two things, back shots and back rubs
And oh I, oh I
I'm that nigga that'll do that
And oh I can't lie, love the way that you move that
You know, know I
Get that check and move through that
Got one clip, two clips, niggas know I keep two straps

[Verse 3: Yhung T.O.]
And that's why, I'm so anti, anti
Can't trust these bitches, no cannot, cannot, oh
And I, and I
Always keep some shooters on standby, standby, no
You fuckin' with a savage
Still remember days I ain't have shit
Everything designer, I don't match it
A band and ten cents for these shoes if you taxing
You ain't fuckin' with a boss nigga
Don't touch, don't ask how much this cost nigga
Just know I, know I
Got tints so dark can't see no eyes, both eyes
And that's why, I'm so anti, anti
Can't trust these bitches, no cannot, cannot, oh
And I, and I
Always keep some shooters on standby, standby
