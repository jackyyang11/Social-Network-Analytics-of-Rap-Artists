I don't really know how the game get played
But really shows how to face this change
Never get old, never get wiser
Big Talk Big Talk
Try to do a lot
But staying in bed
I take it to the heart
I take it to the head
I'm not gonna lie
I think you are a liar
Big walk Big walk
Funny how words have a dimming shit
And lest your name is a frontal bitch
Trying to be a grown up, but we're living just kids
Just kids
We can't hide
We don't lie
You got your whistle, your whistle, you don't buy
Holds of your fire
Take your time
You just keep coming ..keep coming for all side
Big Talk Big Talk..Ha
Big Walk Big Walk..Ho
Big Talk Big Talk..Ha
Big Walk Big Walk
Holds of your fire
Take your time
Holds of your fire
You got to follow me slow cause you can't relate
Here you come you're coming up late
Open up wide Open up wider
Big Talk Big Talk
You're trying to get somber, I'm trying to get safe
I hear you won't talk, but it don't hold weight
Say I am a fight
Say I am a fighter
Big Walk Big Walk
Funny how words have a dimming shit
And lest your name is a frontal bitch
Trying to be a grown up, but we're living just kids
Just kids
We can't hide
We don't lie
You got your whistle, your whistle, you don't buy
Holds of your fire
Take your time
You just keep coming ..keep coming for all side

Don't show him what you really know, oh oh oh
It's getting hotter when you grab a hold
Don't let him make you let it go, oh oh oh
We can't hide
We don't lie
You got your whistle, your whistle, you don't buy
Holds of your fire
Take your time
You just keep coming ..keep coming for all side
