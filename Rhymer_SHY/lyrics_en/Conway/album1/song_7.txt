Ya man rude ting dis
Griselda boi

[Verse 1: Mach-Hommy]
Griselda
You know the Scottish King do it, y'all did it
My nigga if you don't prove it, we won't permit it
You gotta earn your keep in this keepsake
Catch a Zoe da-da-da-oh we don't appreciate
I sit beef like a vegan with a cheese steak
I break the collar with my g and then we cheap skate
I been nice, since been like put the Whitney Houston poster up in his cave you niggas been sprite
My Uzi fuck up your wave son
The abrams with the ice on the tank
That make you niggas say uh
That's word to Romeo and Percy
Ain't no limit with my homie
Hurt my homie so you hurt me
Cersei you gotta run up an pull
Take a chance like when Jon Starks dumped on the bulls
Niggas got to know the difference between a waiter and a sommelier
You fuck niggas is papers we 'bout to load the vape roll the tape

[Verse 2: Conway]
The shit I do with the pen dangerous
In-famous every bar is 10 razors
Hit faces with the ten gauges
Two-eighty-five West in the Benz racing
That's temp-plated
I want the money now bitch I'm impatient
My lil bro will buss your shit open for ten Franklins
He been craving for a body Mach-10 stainless
You a big baby ass nigga Glen Davis (woo)
Raise your glasses let's make a toast
We restored that feeling in the city, we gave 'em hope
I got on niggas records and made 'em dope
It's funny how niggas you show the most love to is who hate the most
My Dominican bitch sniff a plate snow
Scratch the serial off the blickers
Them shits' untraceable
I keep the rifle with a laser and a scope
They saying me and West the new Rae and Ghost
Well I'm humbled by the gesture
Them is big shoes to fill, but I'm not under any pressure
I gave my young'un my gun with the compressor
Gave him 50 for your body he woulda done that shit for lesser nigga
And I ain't even in my prime
Shot in the helmet I guess it wasn't my time
On my brother I'll kill a nigga for my slime
I'm Malcolm holding the (?) peaking out the blinds

[Verse 3:  B.E.N.N.Y. the Butcher]
You know it's real when you down and you set out your books
Held the bible in my hands and i read out the book
Before i had an operation i got fed off of jooks
My little brother took the case and i got let off the hook
Collect the pot then i set the lot
Real street nigga he met the plug before he met his pops
I swear the size of it left him shocked
I took the ride just to watch mean mob niggas connect the dots
I made him mess with pots cheffing rock
D's at my doot the work be flushed before the second knock
Straight to the stage when i left the block
Hit the gun section and cop
Everything they got left in stock
I check my spot and collect the knot
Church with my grandmother drop a band in the collection pot
You know my handle, Tony Soprano
A gangsta nigga I'm Joe Bonanno smoking at the Copacabana
I got a half a bricky flown from Atlanta
What do you know about hand shots
Trying to focus while you loading your hammer
Make a wish and I'll blow out your candles
Why you mad sucka come get this ass whoopin' you know imma hand ya
