[Verse]
Look, look
My nigga sold all kinda raw
But if you got it and we ain't got it
We kicking down your momma door
I'm big homie my youngins'll catch a homi for
Had red dots on your face like Lonzo Ball
Whip a gellato then I call
These niggas is just a lot of talk
Pop up on niggas like lotto balls
Like what's popping, hollow tips popping off
And I ain't stopping 'til I see bodies fall
Left Shade 45 pulled the Mazi off
When them niggas want a beat bodied, I get called
I just gotta call my young nigga
He gon' pop shotty off
Hit yo' knee cap, knock it off
I'm a boss
You know them verses got a cause
I took the blood bottoms off now I rock the Kors
I jot it raw
When I write it I'm fucking psychotic yall
Niggas ain't fucking with me, not at all
Uh, I'm a legend I swear
I'm from the hood, boy, you never was there
All that trappin in your raps but
You ain't never measure a square
Christian Lou in my closet nigga several a pair
Don't ever compare me to a nigga with
Different color dreads in his hair
Uppercut his head in the air
Drop numbers like 23 for the pelicans, yeah
I promise it's been a hell of a year
Yeah, you know it's the Machine
I'm Kobe with the rings
What the fuck is mumble rap? I ain't know it was a thing
You bitches on my dick now they noticing the bling
I'ma just make 'em fuck all the homies on the team
Trying to get my niggas rich get 'em paid
Kill the game then piss on it's grave
Yeah, the four fifth it'll raise
Quick then I empty the whole clip in his waves
Machine nigga
