Hey, did I ever leave your mind?
It's been too long since we've last spoken
Say goodbye
Hey, was it when I held your hand?
Did I ask too much of you with my demands?

[Hook]

I wanna love you until I feel no pain
I wanna kiss you again and again
I wanna hold you, hold you tight
Ooh baby, you slow down time

[Verse 2]

Hey, do you recall what you said?
You must have had a bit too much to drink that night
Hey, can you help me understand
Why you did the things you did behind my back

[Hook]

[Outro]

Oh, you slow down time
Oh, you slow down time
Oh, you slow down time
Oh, you slow down time
