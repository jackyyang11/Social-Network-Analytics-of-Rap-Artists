[Verse 1]
Some say the world gets smaller
The more that you know
Hearts grow bitter
The older we grow
We’re all just dust in the wind
We can’t comprehend
The ways of this world
Of this I’m sure

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m running on empty, but got a ways to go now
And it’s always the same thing
I won’t let you down now
When I’m running on empty

[Chorus]
You’re more than enough
More than enough to make me feel complete
More than enough
More than enough to make me feel complete
You are my overflow
You are my overflow

[Verse 2]
I see the slope getting steeper
The higher we go
The further along
The less it shows
I walk this road less traveled
In search to find
Hopes and fears we've left behind

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m running on empty, but got a ways to go now
And it’s always the same thing
I won’t let you down now
When I’m running on empty

[Chorus]
You’re more than enough
More than enough to make me feel complete
More than enough
More than enough to make me feel complete
You are my overflow
You are my overflow
