[Intro]
You make me so high
You bring me alive
So high

[Verse 1]
Everything I want
Everything I need
I found in you
No matter what they say
I'm gonna find a way
To be with you
Take me to your place of sweet love
Do you realize what you do to me?

[Hook]
You make me so high
You bring me alive
So high, so...

[Verse 2]
Bring me back
Bring me back around
I'm holding on to what I can't have
Make it last
Make it last a while
You help me up when I'm down
Down, down

[Hook]
You make me so high
You bring me alive
So high, so...
