[Verse 1]
Can you feel the sorrow in the rain?
Will you face tomorrow just the same?

[Chorus]
We've been spending most our days
Breaking free from these shackles and chains
Shoot down the moon straight through the sky
Right on through to the other side
Right on through to the other side
Right on through to the other side

[Verse 2]
Watch the roses as they turn to stone
Brim with life until we're dust and bones

[Chorus]
We've been spending most our days
Breaking free from these shackles and chains
Shoot down the moon straight through the sky
Right on through to the other side
Right on through to the other side
Right on through to the other side

[Bridge]
Slow down the pace
We can wait 'til the morning light
Why don't we try to ride on through to the other side

[Chorus]
Right on through to the other side
Right on through to the other side
