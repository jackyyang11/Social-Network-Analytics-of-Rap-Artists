[Verse 1]
Be there in seconds flat
Just tell me where you at
Everywhere you want to go
I've been there before
That means he don't need to know
No one will ever know
No one will have to know

[Verse 2]
Give me a second chance
Just let go of the past
We've been through the high and low
Seen the ebb and flow
That means he don't need to know
No one will ever know
No one will have to know
