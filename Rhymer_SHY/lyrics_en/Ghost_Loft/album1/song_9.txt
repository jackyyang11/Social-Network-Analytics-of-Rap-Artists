Do you ever wonder
What it all means?
Why we tear asunder
Apart at the seams?
Baby, I'm just not what you expected
Don't you see I'm trying?
Trying to get back to you
Talk to me
Talk to me
Talk to me
Is this what you wanted
When you asked to be free?
Free of all commitment
And responsability
Lately I know we've been through some changes
But I'm still trying
Trying to get back to you
Talk to me
Talk to me
Talk to me
Talk to me
Talk to me
Talk to me
In my
In my mind I wait
For my dream
Hopeless
Hopelessly I
I still believe
Talk to me
Talk to me
Talk to me
Talk to me
Talk to me
Talk to me
