[Chorus: Ghost Loft]
We don't have to speak
We don't have to try
Just be easy
Just be easy
We don't have to show
We don't have to hide
Just be easy

[Verse: Danny Seth]
Take it easy while I'm going harder
Spanish chick on my side saying nada
Devil in a dress but she ain't rocking Prada
Fur coat season cause the winter's coming
I'm all about my chips like Dorito lovers
Fuck is up with all these rappers, man? I swear they all late
I'm up early for the money, boy, egg McMuffin
Hair looking scruffy, [?] from out the country
Diamonds jumping out my wrist, you'd think they doing bungee
I ain't worried 'bout the competition, boy
Cause what you call a competition, from here, man, it look like nothing
Check my resumé, boy, I been stunting
The waitress know me by my real name cause I'm tipping hundreds
Make this shit look easy, this a quick example
I'mma have the game wrapped up, Christmas parcel

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Ghost Loft]
Somewhere along the way
Our path has gone astray
And nothing else remains
Everything's changed, nothing is the same

[Outro]
Just be easy
Just be easy
Just be easy
Just be easy
