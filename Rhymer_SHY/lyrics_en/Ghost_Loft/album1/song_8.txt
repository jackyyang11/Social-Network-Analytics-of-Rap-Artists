[Verse 1]
Give me more Sativa, Need to
Treat this weekend like a highschool senior
Invite the super bad chicks and the mean girls
I call it double feature
I like the kush with the crystals
I like the smoke out my window
Every morning if you didn't know
I like them shorts you've got on tho
You can get it tho
See you go
Oh, Drop it low
And shorty let your hair down and back in
I treat your body like it's my own profession
And next is no question, Lets get it
I like my eyes low
Smoking L in the back of the Benzo
Got an actress on my matress
Maybe its the SoCo

[Hook]
I like to get high
With my friends all the time
Don't got nothing on my mind, im good

[Chorus]
You make me so high
You bring me alive
So high
So... [x2]

[Verse 2]
Last night was a movie
I fell asleep in a champagne blue dream
I dont know the whole nine
Just fireworks and strobelights
Money down the ball like
Im outta control right
I like my blunts rolled tight
Smoking homegrown i
Got that kinda lifestyle
Want to make them say, Oh Down ain't by that life
This hoes ain't no housewives
Im getting my mind right
Lets go

[Hook] + [Chorus]
I like to get high
With my friends all the time
Don't got nothing on my mind, Im good
Im good (you make me so high)
Im good (you bring me alive, so high)
Im good (so high)

I like to get high
With my friends all the time
Dont got nothing on my mind, im good

[Outro]
Last night was a movie
I fell asleep in a champagne blue dream
So high [x3]
