All I know, all I know is
That my heart aches from time to time
Haven't you, haven't you been
Reading the questions in my mind
We don't have to speak
We don't have to try
Just be easy
Just be easy
We don't have to show
We don't have to hide
Just be easy
Let it down, let it down now
It's much too late to make amends
All I see, all I see now
Is merely an echo of the end
We don't have to speak
We don't have to try
Just be easy
Just be easy
We don't have to show
We don't have to hide
Just be easy
Somewhere along the way
Our paths had gone astray
And nothing else remained
Everything has changed
Nothing is the same
Just be easy
Just be easy
Just be easy
Just be easy
Just be easy
We don't have to speak
We don't have to try
We don't have to show
We don't have to hide
Just be easy
