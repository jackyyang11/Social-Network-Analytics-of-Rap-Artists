[Verse 1]

Every time, every time I wake
I see your face
Every night, every night and day
You leave without a trace

[Hook]

Baby let me love you down
And it might last awhile
Baby let me love you down
Ooh, won't you stay awhile?
Stay awhile

[Verse 2]

Every time, every time I wake
I see your name
Every night, every night and day
I feel your embrace

[Hook]
