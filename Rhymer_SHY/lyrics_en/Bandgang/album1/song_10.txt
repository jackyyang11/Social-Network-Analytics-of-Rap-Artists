(Intro)
Niggas out here jealous cause we scamin with they hoes

They try to playa hate but love us on the low

We been mobin through the neighborhood need that money now or we gon lay it down

Fuck all that twitter Instagram sneek dissing when you see me nigga betta holla at me

Aye, just know you gotta see me already at ya mama house you ain't gotta meet me

Boy you better beat me in about 10 minutes boy that Mac 90 squeezing

Aye, seeing is believing and no matter what we eating boy you bite the hand that feeds

(Verse 3) Masoe

Stayed down and cane up hard we'on relate get outta bounds we show you to yo part

40 in the bar choppa sittin in the car I was in my zone wit 8 like the Boulevard

Hook snatchin on my niggas I just play it smart shoot off in the hellcat quicker than a dart

Niggas plead to be real left me in the dark throwin shots if we hear you niggas throwin salt

Shit my main mans in ICU I still hustle in and out countin make a u hearing all this "killas" talk like niggas bulletproof

My dawg uh leave yo ceiling leaking like a bad roof

(Chorus)

(Vocalization)
You better beware where you lay we better not find where you stay

(Vocalization)

You better beware where you lay we better not find where you stay
