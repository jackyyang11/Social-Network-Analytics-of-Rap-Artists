[Chorus: BandGang Lonnie Bands]
Nigga fuck this booth
Taste this dope, it'll knock out your tooth, ayy, nigga
I ain't got no job but got a knot on me now, ayy, ayy
I ain't paid no rent nigga
Kicked in the door now we trappin out this bitch nigga, ayy
Nigga I'm hood rich, I'ma set up a spot, ayy, ayy

[Verse 1: BandGang Lonnie Bands]
Front door, back door, nigga it's your way
My trap phone slap though, this bitch ringing all day
That trap slow? uh-uh, this bitch open all day
Free the big Shred, they was poppin' shit broad day
Lately I been on bullshit, stay away from me
Ridin' 'round with a full clip ready to spray somethin'
Pussy nigga don't make excuses, go make money
I'd say fuck my whole career before you take from me
Man a nigga feel so loved when they hate on me
Bitch I been the predator, how your ass gon' prey on me?
Man fuck it, throw the monkey suit on and lay on 'em
Pull up with a lot of air brushes, we gon' paint on 'em, ayy

[Chorus: BandGang Lonnie Bands]
Fuck this booth
Taste this dope, it'll knock out your tooth, ayy, nigga
I ain't got no job but got a knot on me now, ayy, ayy
I ain't paid no rent nigga
Kicked in the door now we trappin out this bitch nigga, ayy
Nigga I'm hood rich, I'ma set up a spot, ayy, ayy

[Verse 2: BandGang Masoe]
In and out them traps, lean fuckin' up my back
Get it and bring it back, don't be fuckin' up your sack
Bitch I never had a job but still managed to stay sharp
It was rob or get robbed, bitch you know we chose rob
Ain't stressing on no probs, real Glocks no props
And don't think just 'cause I rap I won't pull that bitch and pop
Ever since bro got dropped I ain't stopped filling my pop
Hoodrich like I know Keem but I just got it off the block
Rumors of getting dropped while I'm laughing in the drop
Them boys know like my boys know
Block get touched, mommy get dropped
I'm the one filling them spots, used to bring pills to the spots
'Til this rap shit came along, now I'm too hot for a spot
Motherfuckin' money

[Chorus: BandGang Lonnie Bands]
Fuck this booth
Taste this dope, it'll knock out your tooth, ayy, nigga
I ain't got no job but got a knot on me now, ayy, ayy
I ain't paid no rent nigga
Kicked in the door now we trappin out this bitch nigga, ayy
Nigga I'm hood rich, I'ma set up a spot, ayy, ayy

[Verse 3: BandGang Paid Will]
You smell that smell, yeah it's cookie nigga
It took a whole two days to get to me nigga
I'm moving swift through this bitch 'cause they been cookin' niggas
I lost Dante, ain't been the same since they took my nigga, ayy
Fuck the booth, I'm a trapper, don't compare me to these rappers
A lot of niggas be lying and half of 'em be actors
Certified in the streets, nigga go ahead and ask 'em
I earned my stripes nigga, yeah, I'm really savage
You can tell the work good 'cause it got 'em nodding off
You ain't gotta pay nobody else when you your own boss
You'd be surprised bitch if you knew what the load cost
It ain't even been a week and he sending some more off nigga

[Chorus: BandGang Lonnie Bands]
Nigga fuck this booth
Taste this dope, it'll knock out your tooth, ayy, nigga
I ain't got no job but got a knot on me now, ayy, ayy
I ain't paid no rent nigga
Kicked in the door now we trappin out this bitch nigga, ayy
Nigga I'm hood rich, I'ma set up a spot, ayy, ayy
