[Intro]
Me and my nigga Lo just talkin' the other day
I'm like ain't no rapper cosign us nigga, the streets cosigned us

[Verse 1]
City black balling, bitch we back balling
White man just called, we just pill talking, ayy
Label just called, we just mil talking
Told they ass hold on, I'm in the jugg office
I got this bitch driving, I'ma call you back
Twelve bands, six hours, I'm like fuck a rap
I'm on Interstate 80, nigga fuck the trap
Your pussy ass been getting robbed, go and tell 'em that
I done lost my fucking mind, turned water to wine
In the hood pouring lines like I can't get signed
And you sitting on the fence like you can't get found
Once you jump in that water, boy your ass gon' drown
Once you jump in that fire, boy your ass gon' burn
Since you want all these problems, boy your ass gon' learn, ayy
Fuck these niggas talkin' 'bout, bitch it been our turn
Fuck these niggas talkin' 'bout, bitch it been our turn

[Chorus]
No rapper cosigned us
Nigga, the streets cosigned us
If you want us pussy nigga, come and find us
You better kill us 'fore these labels come and sign us
Niggas want to shoot us
It ain't even no beef, they just mad as fuck
They just mad as fuck
It ain't even no beef, they just mad as fuck

[Verse 2]
I'm grimy towards niggas who're grimy towards me
I'm a real ass nigga and I put that on P
You flashing five bands, dog I make that in a week
Man that's lil pocket change dog, that baby shit steep
Play me you gon' make me leave you way in shit's creek
Well the point I'm tryna make, I'ma show you shit stink
Called your bitch over, fucked her on the kitch' sink
She kept on screaming big so I made the bitch leave
The funny part about it I ain't give her not a sleeve
She ask but I ain't budge ho, I need my guapanese
I'm laughing too hard, let me see my doctor please
These funny ass niggas got my kidney feeling weak

[Verse 3]
Bitch, still high from yesterday, get higher today
Anything you gotta say, you take that up with the K
Niggas' labels calling and we don't want shit with a K
IM's and book us flights, you might cosign us today
I got work out in these streets, if rap don't work then I'm good
Niggas really don't respect you, might get killed in your hood
[?] was the first under 20 to rock R's in the hood
Don't come through trippin' cause them killers eating bars in the hood
Got work like Tapo, pay rent through five bows
Buy guns, won't buy clothes, not yours, them our hoes
He fucked up like typos
Rolex hitting like a light show
We don't do scares, we hate those
BandGang, straight gang, case closed

[Verse 4]
Used to be a lame, that got old quick
Hit the road for 30 days with the same shit
He was at the spot while I was gone, on some ho shit
But I jumped right back on the Mega, that ain't stop shit
Niggas mad labels calling out the blue
I can front a couple bowls, give you a month or two
But take my kindness for weakness, put that Glock to use
Me and Biggs run through quarters like a target booth

[Verse 5]
Blackballing ass city
It's politics, same [?] we got banned
I went rich nigga, ask Rose
Five bitches all working, they on their shit
And if them hoes keep puttin' up they might get rich
Nigga, to start shit, these niggas know what's up
It can't [?] around this bitch, say they vouched us
It's six of us and we the king of the streets
And we ain't stressin' over deals, either way we gon' eat
Nigga

[Chorus]
No rapper cosigned us
Nigga, the streets cosigned us
If you want us pussy nigga, come and find us
You better kill us 'fore these labels come and sign us
Niggas want to shoot us
It ain't even no beef, they just mad as fuck
They just mad as fuck
It ain't even no beef, they just mad as fuck
