[Verse 1: BandGang Javar]
Yo bitch messy
FYI I'm the nigga she been texting
Super ham you saving hoes been running to they rescue
Reverend, need the collection plate cause I'm a blessing
Ain't friendly, if you ain't tryna fuck then why you texting
Straight finessing, you ain't tryna flip your cash why you text me
You think this a scam bitch you guessed it
Feds been watching me like channel 2 I feel the pressure
Momma told me go and get a job gave me a lecture
I been stressing, but niggas on my head keep me laughing
The movies AMC the only time you seen some action
Say they don't really see us in them cars they need some glasses
Glasses, niggas say they snatched em they be acting
Back to your wifey she a runner me and Biggs already fucked her
Your man's told you she was on this dick but you trust her
Disgusting, she just want a picture in the Buffies
BandGang we shitting on these niggas we need Huggies

[Verse 2: Paid Will]
These hoes, they be fucking with some hams it's the BandGang baby get a nigga with some bands
This nigga starving, walking around looking like Marvin in them Chargers behind tint, bitch I'ma baller
These hams, thank God for em though [?] get it ReRock like the bro, all in your bitch phone we be creeping on the low
Any problems let me know that's what I got the sweeper for
It feel good goin out the hood cause it's scorching on the block
DD trippin riding solo got the 9 in the chop
Poured a 8, straight drop that was only 2 pops can't remember last night,I  think I fucked 2 thots
This shit for real finessing and jugging, I need a million
Either hate the gang or love the gang, cause we them niggas
When it come to getting chicken, you know who really get it we been tearing up the mall so old we been did it nigga

[Verse 3: BandGang Masoe]
Roller, bitch I got that roll ask the sweeper
I cook em, bitch I really bake em like Anita
Remida, a freaky bitch from Easter should've seen it
She suck it, like I forgot to wash it so she clean it
I smoke it, I lost my fucking mind it got me blowing
A smoker, can't see this only eighthy so I know it
I finessed the plug for some rocksies and a dub
Your bitch gets super wet because the Buffs look like a tub
I hate to let my son see my phone I'm missing juggs
If this bitch hold this whole thousand I might give this hoe a hug
Been finessing since a pup
Put me nearer then it's gone
If you move, rest in peace
That's another sad song
Us broke can you imagine that? Nigga we past that
These niggas broke they don't finesse, we invented that
They don't know about getting three, hit em for three more back
Next ding a call get three more then double that
