[Bandgang Biggs]
I do not go by the book, playing catch me with the hook
They can't catch me, i be running to the money, watch me book
700 on my foot, Louie sneaks to be exact
Getting slow mo'd by yo ho, while I'm cheifing on that pack
Stuffing weed all in my sack, cause the police try to flick me
They be tripping in my city, man what is up with that
50 drum up in that 40, fucked your bitch ain't wear a hat
I'm that nigga, don't you bitches get it, bitch I'm where it's at
Balenciaga's , 6 50 dollars, you ain't got nada
Y'all got problems with dum and Cali, shout out to Project Poppa
Keep them choppers long barrel come get you and yo momma
Y'all behind us, we go out here and get it and we got it
Two steps ahead, I got double up
Let a nigga come between my money, then that money on him
5 bands make you think about making yourself a donor
Nigga you real or you ain't, ain't no undercover
Had her under cover, she busting and clapping like the thunder
I'm under pressure, I smell the money, you know I want it
Either you want it or you don't, ain't no sugar coating
And ain't no turning back around when that clip rolling
Zannie bars and the lean, got your bitch rolling
John just mopped the floor, so she tip toe'n
All gold rollie on got my wrist glowing
Robins on man my whole fit foreign
Gave a corner bum 300, that's a fit for 'em
Try to play me like a ho, Ima trick then
I love bands, I just love big bands
Fuck a 20 dollar bill I just want them big bands
