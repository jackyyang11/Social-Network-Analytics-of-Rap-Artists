[Verse 1: BandGang Lonnie Bands]
They want the old bandman, here you go niggas
We gon' keep rollin' up and y'all gon' keep gettin' smoked nigga
Free Rose and Jizzle, why y'all double back in the store with it?
My dog did it on camera, why y'all actin' like y'all don't know who did it?
They act like me, they rap like me
But they ain't stood in the trap like me
Niggas ain't stamped like me, ayy
They need to pay homage, yeah bitch, come pay Lonnie
Nigga I'm out here every day
Pussy nigga how you can't find me?
Ayy, don't put my trust in no bitch, these hoes gon' turn quick
Man these niggas get a lil money with you and they burn bridge
Nigga I barely got ice on, but a nigga turn heads
Nigga I pull up with that perm-stick nigga, and I burn heads, hey

[Chorus: BandGang Masoe]
Niggas wanna act like us, rap like us
But they ain't stood in traps like us, ain't stamped like us
Bitch I got my ice on probably, ain't shit tucked
Boy you better use your head 'fore that get busted
Niggas wanna act like us, rap like us
But they ain't stood in traps like us, ain't stamped like us
Bitch I got my ice on probably, ain't shit tucked
Boy you better use your head 'fore that get busted

[Verse 2: BandGang Masoe]
Been a long time comin', niggas hatin' 'bout nothin'
Had to cut my own cousin, can't deal with niggas frontin'
Whole building probably bumpin', breakin' down whole onions
Niggas love you 'til you something, then they tellin' niggas fuck you
Bad bitches gon' suck him, niggas mad they can't touch him
I done came up from nothin', you can learn somethin' from me
Mama love what I'm becomin', she don't know I'm in the dungeon
She don't know we really clutchin', we don't show 'em 'til we bustin'
Show love and got nothin' from it, these niggas stole from us
We done made money, gave 'em words, man them songs from us
Don't give two fucks, these out of town niggas ain't seen no bucks
Rip Dots, rip Purp, goin' hard for my niggas that we put inside dirt

[Chorus: BandGang Masoe]
Niggas wanna act like us, rap like us
But they ain't stood in traps like us, ain't stamped like us
Bitch I got my ice on probably, ain't shit tucked
Boy you better use your head 'fore that get busted
Niggas wanna act like us, rap like us
But they ain't stood in traps like us, ain't stamped like us
Bitch I got my ice on probably, ain't shit tucked
Boy you better use your head 'fore that get busted

[Verse 3: BandGang Paid Will]
Niggas ain't spent them long nights, so many cold nights, up in them traps
I spent overtime in them bitches nigga, yeah, had to get to them racks
I'm a real nigga, what I say real, nigga, this shit all facts
Stand in the field nigga, play dumb if you want to, gon' end up whacked
Bitch I'm a reaper, I fuck then leave her, you probably gon' keep her
We got flavors nigga, come place your order, get that quicker than a pizza
I'm still hand in hand, still makin' plays, and I still tax for a feature
I still call shots in my hood nigga, that's probably why I can't leave her
Niggas can't rap like me
Can't trap like me, just won't happen
Niggas can't stack like me
Ain't stamped like me, we ain't actin'
Spent too many nights in the dark, yeah that's probably why I turned savage
P's stacked way to the ceiling, bitches smell the loud through the package nigga

[Chorus: BandGang Masoe]
Niggas wanna act like us, rap like us
But they ain't stood in traps like us, ain't stamped like us
Bitch I got my ice on probably, ain't shit tucked
Boy you better use your head 'fore that get busted
Niggas wanna act like us, rap like us
But they ain't stood in traps like us, ain't stamped like us
Bitch I got my ice on probably, ain't shit tucked
Boy you better use your head 'fore that get busted
