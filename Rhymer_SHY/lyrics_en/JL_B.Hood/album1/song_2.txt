[Hook]
They say psy-psy-psy-psychosis
Why they wanna hit me with a diagnosis
Why they wanna make sure my mind closes
Conspiracy my ass, they want us to die fast
Expose this psychosis, if you wouldn't mind blow this
Get deep, get mind blowing, got mine going, psycho shit

[Verse 1: JL]
I hope this, wakes you the fuck up
The truth get untucked, we move we bust rush
Pursue the justice, uproot the truth
Gather troops, they wanna lock me outta the booth
Stop me, but watch me get loose
Defying a mental giant in an environment of violent
Men, the kind that'll live and die for the rival
The love a crime, we're in confinement
And that's why I kinda feel like rhyming is an assignment
Climb in a nigga's mind and I'm gonna sign it
Permanent, gonna learn it and get excited
Recite it and be reminded that every time to look alive
You've been invited to take a ride
Give me five minutes, throwin' my venom in the fire
Just to heighten it, enlighten it and get inspired
Might be surprised, truth in a lie
You can decide on why

[Verse 2: JL]
Mankind caught up in a cycle of apathy
Absent of passion and fear unhappily
Consuming the greater part of our energy exactly
What is the purpose of the secret service?
It had to be a plan of the wicked to paralyze the intellect
Will generation next survive the internet
Microwave knowledge the benefit been a threat
Third eye blindness, mystically illiterate
Ignorant impossible to expect you to give a shit
Hear me and call it conspiracy theory
I fear we fallen  you're mentally weary it's
Tyranny over the mind's memory
What a well designed enemy
Clinically brain scattered, chemically imbalanced
Express malice, such untapped talents
Told what we know with an unmatched challenge
Look at those that control, this is all out madness
Keepin' us from the knowledge
Let us suffer in silence
Terminating the treat made us veterans of the violence
Reaching for what's inside us
No one is gonna guide us
Don't see the obvious
Then don't bother lookin' behind us
Keepin' our minds on how fine Nikki Minaj is
Or Louis Vuitton, see the signs
Who the designers
While they design a new bomb to drop on us
New micro chips, satellites and narcotics
It's crazy, we puppets
Tap into twitter and trigger our favourite topics
Big Brother, baby sitter, create subjects
Got us all on the hook, any moment they're gonna gut us
As long as we look at stars as something up above us
We lack perspective, see that deception?
They flexing and really don't expect us to make that connection

[Verse 3: JL]
If this ain't fresh, I don't know what is
If this ain't blessed I'm cold and faithless
If this ain't dope then I must be cracked out
If this ain't hope then we must be assed out
If I ain't right, then I must have got left
If you ain't heard, nigga you must be deaf
Kill all drama, cause we don't need stress
Stop more fights than a UFC ref
I just wanna party and kick it with the army
Looking like a star key player in a game
Insane, no one to harm me
It's gonna be the day I wake up in a new Bugatti
For sentimental gain, my aim in a Ferrari
Thank God we got a chance to do it properly
Advance, ain't no hand I'm dealt stopping me
Real shit, got this sick and felt awkwardly
No hobby
Survival of the illest
Rise over the limits
Realize what is within us
Deny what they will give us
Take what they don't want us to have
They want to kill us and fast
They putting salt in the bath
Insaulting us
Wising up though, handling business
Stop this senseless crime on my senses
I can obtain whatever my interest
This is a new theme song for my entrance
Go hard, go hard or, go home, don't bother
If you in fear of the flame it get hotter
Go be inferior, lame, in low water
You on holy ground wit no honor
Pull your halo down to yo' collar
Get paid but slave to no dollar
I'll maintain that I'm sane, but they holler
