Yo
Ive been a starving artist for years
The arguements we've had already brought me to tears
I know part of it is i could have had 100 careers
But in the same amout of time and made us all millionaires
Nothing scares my momma like ima fail
Tell them my talents are rare and i dont apply to the trail
Want to me to have kids but i won't be JL
In this face disappears in front of the wedding bell
No trace of faith in the crossroads
Complaints from a blank face that im not so hot so im hostile
In any case im a lost soul chasing the dream and tears with runny nostrils
[?] weird look what i got
But if skills paid bills id be in a yatch floating off the coast
Look how i feel riddle me not everything stop
You give me another shot



Im hurried and racing in my soul just to lose
[?]


All yall know me to be the strong one
Never said this last year been a long one
And i done stayed on my path and another song sung
And i done prayed all i ask for is get the wrong done
The outcome is always gonna fall apart
Im not done ill fall with a broken heart
Like how come its always cold and dark??
I done sacrifised all for this spoken art
Everybody telling me its coming up
And my reality has beem telling me i should let it go
Is there a hell in the dead end im headed for
Hell i would be suprised if my head explode
I attempt to write up another classic
Like a pimp tell me do it or get my ass kicked
Im convinced fellow its a lack of passion
And i admit i was distracked on this track

Im hurried and racing in my soul just to lose
[?]

Feeling like i can hang with the best of them
I spit and it was like the death of them
Knocked off the high horse got em confessing
Downward spiral misfortune estimate
Stress weighs heavy up on my chest
Im praying and playing this is a mess
I was hiding out at the address
I ain't lying i tried that and ive returned
So many reasons that im blessed
Knowing that you only colaborate with the best
Won't elaborate but i thought i had it i guess
That i ain't good enough to compare to the rest
Im sinking and who do i gotta kill
Got me thinking maybe i wasn't ready keeping it real
Maybe i dont have what it takes to get a deal
Mistakes got me ill
I gotta chill
