Time, time is only relevant to the clock that its measured with
Its 2 o'clock in the morning the sun is gone and the studios looking candle lit
Lighters spark up cigars and Bowls of the sticky shit
Reminiscing this playing mental videos what flick is this
This is basically time travelling, mind unravelling
Life consists of a bunch of nows
Twists and turns ups and downs
Same Light, Same beat different sounds
Got me thinking is it me that’s the bad one
Going off like a bad gun
Can't imagine me that drunk
I know it Had to be made up
But I Finally gave up tryna put on the show
Who gon’ clean the stage up I ain't got time for it
Whenever this Opportunity knock
I gotta be ready to sign for it
Moved up outta the hood ain't ready to die for it
Told my Lil bro we gotta go
Get away from this dumb shit, don’t leave them a thumb print
Let him know, that I love him
And no matter the way we get to this money in 2k11 we gotta get to it
But you never gave me a choice
What do you wanna drive
This is they year that we doing it bigger than ever I feel it deep down inside
I'm giving it all of my energy all of my time long as I am alive
No I'mma grind, shit, watching the fans fall in line
Cause they know that I fast no Ramadan
A couple years ago Was doing all kinds of crime
And at the show hoes doing all kinds of grime
Time, its only a matter of it but it doesn’t matter does it
You gotta live now or love it
That’s why you never see me rock a watch when im out in public
But you will know im zoning off of a soon to be legal substance
Random thoughts, scatter braining
So hypocritical, contradicting myself but its pitiful
Don’t take everything I say literal, critical
Pieces of information can give off mixed signals
And everybody will never know
Every word you meant when you wrote it
Misrepresented to they friends when they quote it
But im really happy you know it though
Logically no way to control it
Perception can be such a deadly component
And for all we know, This could be the end of time that we living in
We ignorant, send us to inner cities so sickening
Witnessing how weakened The government is
Such a predicament, we in, Fuck the end
What did we begin
Know what im saying? Ignorance is bliss though
Don’t wanna make a Panic at a disco, im on some other shit yo
It strange how my train of thought go when im this blow
Gotta pardon me kin folk, Im high as hell
