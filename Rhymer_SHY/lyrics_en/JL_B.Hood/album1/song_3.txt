[verse 1 : JL]
I'm on the heels of my dreams
And I never woulda made it without building a team
Hustle real is the scene, if I wasn't filming the scene
You will feel that i being, extreme
Everything's more complicated but i can take it
But my energy's concentrated, the crown'll get confiscated
I feel obligated to walk the top is automated
Integrated wit the famous isn't the picture i painted
The pain is part of the payment provided your entertaining
Provide for my family anything that you want you name it
The industry's been invaded if they hate it how did Jay Z say it?
"would you rather be underpaid or overrated" shit
I ain't sweating none of them, shitting on everyone of them
My stomach rumbling I'm hungry again I'm hungrier than 'em
And your criticism just isnt ???

Im inventing ways to get rid of the feeling
(the fab and chillings??)

I was made for the stardom, hate 'em that you are done
Going hard till the lord come
This is our time
I'm on the road to success
And I'm looking far bombed, exploding
You gotta live in the moment


[verse 2 : Oobergeek]
It's amazing how I mazed them
Not too fond of (dion?) renaissance
Gotta find multiple ways to get them dollar signs
So haters speak that knowledge or create an ambiance to get my lad-de-das
Especially when i speak the words im written
Like (they spoke in poem form like???????)

I'm already known like, fuck this shit i know I'm right, wrong
I gotta climb the mountain to get that dolamite stone
With the heart of a lion, with the hunger of bear and shit
Don't be surprised if i get the glory and don't share my shit
Selfish bastard, tempers starting to flare and shit
Updating they statuses like i really care and shit
I know i know i know i make it look easy
Double O-B-E-R-G-E , E-K
Also known as sensei of my  DK
Teaching hypocrisy to mediocrisy
Can't get these thoughts up off of me
J told me to get the beat and kill it
I'ma kill it, I'ma film it like how I reel it
The bootleggers gone try and steal it
But they can't steal it if they attempted
Cameras in they jackets whenever they see me practice
But i don't even practice I just live it
Some nigga had the nerve to tell me to watch (film?)
How you gone watch it when you in it
Y'all niggas most anticipated but dieing to be in this
Spin the shit again only with me and J again
