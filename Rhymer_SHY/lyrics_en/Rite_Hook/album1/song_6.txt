[Rite Hook]

Guess I'll never know

[Verse 1]
I want your innocence turned into sins again
And it always makes me want more
I can't just fight this, but you always want this
[?]

[Hook]
Ooh I, better not be talkin' through ya
Cause soon I, wanna get you high
Ooh I, better not be talkin' through ya
Cause I'll just be walkin' through ya
Cause soon I, wanna get you high
She wants to run free, not like her company
The way you love again (The way you love again)
Why don't you run free, I don't want your company
Cause it makes you wanna fall down (fall down)

[If only I ever knew, I don't even think about you
The second you call me though, right back in the swing of things]

[Verse 2]
I want you in front of me, closed off and I love the scene
When I'm in the moment everything's so good
When I wake from the fantasy, [?]
[?]

[Hook]

[We both know why we're here right now, no fuckin' kiddin' around
Just for the drugs and the sex and that's it]

[Verse 3]
Tell you girl when I'm fuckin' you, [?]
And it always makes me want more
Everytime I cross the line, gotta understand that I lost my mind
All the time I wanna fall down

[Hook X2]

[and after all these years, I think I've finally figured it all out]
