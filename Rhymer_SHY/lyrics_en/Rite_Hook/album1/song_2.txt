It's the only way I know, to reach you

[Hook]
I need you, I want you I breathe you, I own you
Everything, I call your name [I call your name]
So, don't leave me, for I can't, say goodbye, I'm sorry
I'll outlive you I hope I can [I hope I can]

[Verse 1]
These are the last words of a dying man
See the worst part is I gotta try again
But that's the meaning of it
What you always told me, do the right thing
But I ignored you and now I'm lonely
That's the consequence I'm willing to face now
Cause what i'm building will be filling the space now
The void, what was missing can be replaced now
Your boy, doesn't want to live with his face down
Destroyed, anymore, I say we all explore this new life
And feel all this for a reason
I know it's hard but I'm kinda sure
It was supposed to happen for something down the road
That's what binds us together, tighter than the type of friends that when it's over come and [?]
So let this song be soothin' to you and be true to the rhythm, I'm ok

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
It all starts with a great job, pulling up and out of the ordinary
You did all you could but I rebelled, got myself locked in a cell
Against all my morals and I was taught this was hell
And I gotta say, you in my [?]
Nothing you did caused me to fall into a bad dream
You deserve to be happy by any means mother
And I think it all starts by understandin' each other
And dad, you are my hero and still stand
[?] write this with my tears
And as I'm chokin' up, I been fighting this for years
The truest words ever that need to be said
So fuck what anyone thinks or has to say about it
I'd rather drown twice than go a day without it
This gut feeling that I have, gotta be livin'
So let this song be soothin' to you and be true to the rhythm, I'm ok

[Hook]
