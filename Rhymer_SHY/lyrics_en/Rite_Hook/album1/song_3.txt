[Rite Hook] what up Peter Parker, DJ Dow Jones, this is the Free Trade Agreement, I ain't wastin' no time, leedz

[Verse 1]
So many kids, I done had enough, so many fuckin' little pussies rappin but never had it tough
Daddy sat em up, in the front row of anger management in '04
That's when you decide to make a career out of this huh
It's kinda funny yo I'm young in this game but know the fuckin road is comin slow
It sucks, you gotta face it cause I don't want to be that old dude hatin' on the younger generations
I'm moving with the times, stayin' relevant, so if that means I gotta dumb down the rhymes I guess I gotta do it sometimes
Just for the hell of it, that shit was intelligent, speakin' to myself, my bad, you don't get it kid
I feel like I'm talkin' to myself like M said, but I thought it before he made a song about it for 10 years
Ahead of my time 'n that's for sure, only cause I was taught by the best of 'em tellin' me what's raw
[?]
Outkast and Slick Rick were killin' shit and talked through my speakers, I took it as a student and saw the teachins
Can't forget Nas and J, I could go all day but this blunt got me zonin' and ramblin' away
So much animosity but I handle the never ending hate like it's love and he's likin' it, fight with you punks
[?] and they all know my history, impeccably nicer that y'all
A definite win, enough of me [/] when they supposedly spit
A vast black hole of rehashed assholes, I'm from the wrong side of things and see past that joke
Things are changin', they have been since day one, you just acknowledge it, easier with age and amazed 'em with every chance you get patience is something that should dislayed like a blazing gun, fear it but take it as it comes, face it but wait for snakes to run, ain't it funny how things relate when you're making jems
'n all these lyrics came to me once I heard the beat
The instrumental to my life, it's like a murder scene
The theme music for the walk home, after you witness someone you love gettin' hurt when you talk to 'em
The realization that it's your fault, acceptin' it, like the death of a relative, lettin' go of it
Hope you feel that too, the key the song is played in, the man of many faces, jottin' the pages
Swayin' on top of it, lost in the matrix [?] that's why I drink a bottle every night and talk the basics
Keepin' us grounded together, lay the foundation down first and we can drown 'em forever
Makin' others seem like they underwater and bothered, makin' all my dreams possible, when all of you wanna
Thought I made it clear, coulda sworn god gave you ears, use em what they're made for, if not then what you doin' ain't sayin' shit
I'm made for this and that's a motha fuckin' given, brought up in a city of shitty kids taught to be criminals, Boston, can't forget Worcester, the whole state of Mass is in a state of chaos, I'm watchin' it crumble often
But the heart and soul in us is on like [?] let's open it up
Show em what it's here for, raw talent is there in rare form, I'm at the front of the march with a real gun
While you kids are playin' with the nerf shit, since when was it cool to be a nerd in the verse shit
I'm laughin' while I'm thinkin' about it but it's a serious matter so all I can do is bring it out

[Verse ]
Exposin' you, don't you know how to follow a crowd, I suppose you do, suckas draw when I'm around like I'm aimin' true, expose em like a photo shoot, I always wonder what happened to the truth, close my eyes and roll the dice
So far life hasn't given much at least you got you mind still so you focus right, I guess that's how it's goin' down
