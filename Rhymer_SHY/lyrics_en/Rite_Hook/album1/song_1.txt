[Liam Neeson - The Grey] I don't need walk through this world with fear in my heart

[Rite Hook]From the wrong

[Verse 1]
Please help me, screamin' to the sky
[?]
I can feel it, it's like it's leakin' up in my mind
Seepin' out the sides of my head, my thoughts are runnin' wild
Grateful for the pain I felt, it's keeping me alive
Cause I've died before I've seen the other side and that's no lie
My world is like one hundred times more than yours
How much more can I afford to lose
Choose your life over the morgue, well of course you do
Well I can't say I haven't had a tool in my face
And those thoughts are so luminous, there's music to make
With a pendulum of doom and the certain feelin' of collapse
But with every ounce of energy you manage to attack
And amongst your own insanity you feeling something back, that's your soul
You cry for it, well here it is intact
Like a stranger unfamiliar, yeah do what you been told
Your home, it's coming back tenfold
And I'm...

[Hook]
Stepping off the plane, luggage full of pain
Strangers here but he's still the same
Don't tell me war stories now
It's all about me when I'm laying down
Another page, turns away
I open up the book but it's still the same
Don't tell me war stories now
It's all about me when I'm laying down

[Verse 2
I'm having dreams of apocalypse and watching this disease
Spread across the land
Steppin' off the plane
I'm not the same
Walk the lane
It's the walk of shame
Awful lot of pain to deal with
But it's nothing that I can't do, I'm insane
Fuckin' eh kid such a different sensation
Do realize that what you're missin' is patience
You're on a mission of mistakes that's takin' your life away piece by piece
But you face it cause you ain't got a choice but to survive, that's what you do
Recognize these eyes from the lie, its fucking true
And everything I say is a gem, I'm trying to pave my way back into
Hands of gods so I can break him again
Tryin' to repay the people in my life that I hurt
So I'm making amends but sometimes it doesn't make any sense
I'm in it, no turning back now, I got this
Time to stand on my own, forget these crutches

[Hook]

He's runnin'
He's runnin' home
Away from everybody
A thousand, a thousand
[?] from nothin'
They tryin', they want him
But he just keeps on runnin'
A thousand, a thousand
[?] from nothin'

[Hook]
