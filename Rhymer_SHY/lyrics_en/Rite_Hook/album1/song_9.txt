[Chorus]
Slowly they'll miss ya
Then take my picture
If you're rememberin' me (If you're rememberin' me)
Surely they'll miss ya
Then take my picture
If you're rememberin' me (If you're rememberin' me)

[Verse 1]
A slow flicker
Flash bulbs snap
Take a picture
While I'm still here to give the masses a mixture
Both worlds from photographer and victim
You the uplifter
The ones [?]died have come
From dead to alive
I'm the hottest one
Slippin' fingers, creepin' on the things that I've done
Like undeveloped pictures, I need light and the sun just never hits us
So wave your hands like you're holdin' undeveloped pictures
My whole life is like an undeveloped picture
I need a quick pick me up, a nose sniffer
Seein' a real difference in us cause we differ
Remember this face when I pay for this
Just a list of myself [?]
They don't know me now then go in your sisters room
Where soon you'll find my picture

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
(There's no gloom) There's no gloom for the, for the whole world
Lookin' for a snapshot of a lil' girl
Low self-esteem but I mean she knows her
Sex sells and don't care, everyone keeps starin'
Like a shot from a Canon
We're all watch like we're not interferin'
But who we are is [?]
You think you know [?]what the f who you are
One wrong move is a lost soul In the game
While they takin' pictures in my strange
What does that consider, a difference in the brain, you and me
People are just gifted and some jus' ain't
So wave your hands like you're holdin' undeveloped pictures
My whole life is like an undeveloped picture
I need a quick pick me up, so flow sicker
Seein' a real difference in us cause we differ

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Now that's the last thing that you got left to memory
A moment you caught in a flash and couldn't ever leave
Behind, a lesson learned
But from my standpoint, it's gettin' burned
My head is in the sky and when I'm in your eyes
You take a picture and it don't develop till I die
And all of this is evidence of everything you want
Never hurt till a memory replaces what my head is spilling out
Then emerge, what's it for?
A coffin symbolizes death and death's a bird
Spreads it's wings and catches flight
Except tonight you got the chance to express your bite
And I'm gone before I'm there
A couple songs for you to share
So long, farewell, who cares

[Chorus]
