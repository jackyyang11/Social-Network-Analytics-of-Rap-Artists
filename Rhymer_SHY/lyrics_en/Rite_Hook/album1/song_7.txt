[Verse 1]
This is my life, through trial and error
Guaranteed I'm gonna make my mark, hopefully it's before I die cause I don't wanna wait that long
Paintin' on war paint, and I make my songs
This is love, hate and happiness in a vacant room
Shootin' bullets in the ceiling, lookin' at my baby pictures
Prayin' for my brother and sister, this is how I miss them
[?]
Now I gotta run a straight line, I'm tryin' ta
Might as well snort a line right, I'm dyin' ta
Where's that gonna leave me, high and dry and such
So I put a fuckin' fist through the wall, sickly though
The power I was born with is one of the century
That won't be matched, I guess the gods picked me
So original, competition don't exist with me
Now's the time or it's never gonna happen
If it don't, then everyone is measured with the gadget
It tells me if you're cowardly, you're relevant to madness
The pendulum of life and this is telling me your average
Ha, I refuse to be ignored like the music isn't provin' that I'm brutal in your thoughts

[Hook]
Nobody said it's easy, sometimes it's hard believin'
You gotta find a reason here
I swear I'll make my damage before I leave this planet
Why else would I be livin' here?

[Verse 2]
I'm here on the concrete, I walk when I step
[?]
I'll take it for myself and my fam, can't you let me live
I know what it's like to be unhappy
Search for a smile from [?]
Or hope to find love from a drug that's killed practcally everybody I know and put the rest in maxi
I live life in a cage, fuck that, I'm not an animal or maybe I am
But even an animal deserves better than being stuck sufferin' in a padded
A lion needs to run loose, the addict needs a spoon
The eagle needs to fly, that's a given
God didn't give you wings to flap 'em while you're sittin'
So after this catastrophe disentigrates we livin', I'm pickin' things up what I can and practicin' things different

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Shake this tree for whatever it's got
Cause I been measuring things out like a measuring cup
If enough work is put in then it's steppin' everyones up
Never happen though cause someone's always settin you up
I'm used to livin' with the eyes in the back of my head, it's natural, that's the way it is, you get wacked and you're dead
Maybe it's better, maybe they're happy you're gone
It's not a long shot cause we been havin' a tough time taggin' along, with the brain washin' world [?]
Fight harder than you ever have like you're boxin' for the belt, watch the world [?]
Feel like you need a turn or a change in your wakin' life, how longs it gonna take you to make this right

[Hook]
