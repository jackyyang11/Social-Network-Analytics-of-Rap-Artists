[Rite Hook]
Never listen to a friend's friend of a friend

[Hook]
So now it's starting to show
She hoped that I wouldn't know
But I can see you clearly
I think it hurts her feelings
She's Crazy
Upside down on the ceiling
She's Crazy
Don't mean to hurt your feelings

[Verse 1]
It isn't difficult to see this
From the first date
She was pickin' at the Jesus
Saying shit like "Doesn't this look like freakin Jesus"
Spare me with the religion shit unless you're being facetious
I bust it up and change the conversation quick
No matter what I said, it all related to relationships
Now that's a major turn-off, ain't it miss what you don't agree
I dunno, you bein' a crazy bitch
Why'd I listen to Jen, thanks for the warnin' but
For some fuckin' reason I could never get a normal one
I get us beer, she orders one
Everything I do you gotta one up me
What a dumb story huh
I'm sayin' this up in my head
Cause I don't want to blurt out shit I fuckin' regret
Where's the check, I'm trying to take us back to my place
She hopped up and straddled me right there and started slappin' my face
What the fuck?

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I asked her why the fuck she did that
She said What you don't like it rough
Yah I do, but on a big slap
I was still sittin' at the dinner table, mismatched

But I'm the type to never get the picture
So we got up in the whip, she started sippin' on a mackaroll[?]
I think it fuck it maybe she's a better person drunk
If not I've got a little skunk to get her workin' up
To givin' head but when she did, she started burpin' up
Fuck disgusting, she never stopped and want to slurp it up "NO!"
So now I gotta treat her like a puppy, "Touch me!"
But every time I do, she likes it more till she loves me "Touch me!"
Very attractive with smeared makeup, but wouldn't do it so
She began scream we're breaking up
Well aren't you gonna walk me to the front step?
I'll open the door but you're on your own you fuckin' dumb bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Listen I'm sorry for callin' you names girl
But ever since I picked you up you been fuckin' insane girl
I don't even know why I'm in your house in the first place
This is the worst first date in the world, it could be the worst case
Put her purse down on the table then her face lit up as I tried to sneak out the door with a quick run
See ya!
And I sped off in her mothers whip
I'll bring it back tomorrow but I might be with another chick
And I did
[?]
Now I'm back outside her house sippin' forties, dippin' shorty
I heard a Knock knock at the window
Wonder who it is, fuckin' here we go, you're in for it
Put the gloves on
This bitch does not fuck around at all
I tried it earlier and I was miserable
She opened up the door and told us "LET'S GO"
Her name was Lemon, she was insane from the get-go

[Hook x2]
