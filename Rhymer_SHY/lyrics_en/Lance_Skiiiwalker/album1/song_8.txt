[Verse 1]
'Til it feels good
Gotta keep lovin' you baby
Let the years grow, baby
Gotta keep lovin' you darling
So don't start it, 'cause you doin' it right
Girl I want you, all day and night

[Hook]
As the moon glows, baby
I'ma keep lovin' you baby
Make you feel good, darling
I'ma keep lovin' you darling

[Verse 2]
As the love show
Gotta stay home with you baby
Dead kids grow, baby
Gotta stay humpin' you darling
So don't start it, 'cause you do it right
Girl I want you, all day and night
Make you feel good, baby
Gotta stay humpin' you darling

[Hook]
As the moon glows, baby
I'ma keep lovin' you baby
Make you feel good, darling
I'ma keep lovin' you darling
As the moon glows, baby
I'ma keep lovin' you baby
Make you feel good, darling
I'ma keep lovin' you darling
