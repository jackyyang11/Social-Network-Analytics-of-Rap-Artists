Pt I

[Intro]
You're my one and only

[Verse 1]
Well it's Friday morning, and I'm headed
Up out the door
Grab keys, grab phone, grab coat, let me go
Shit I can't miss a thing when I'm here
Pursuing life
Told 'em hold up, let me lock in
Some navigation escaption
Sounds awfully fun
I drive; I'm feelin' good, let this shit run
Cause I can't miss a thing when I'm here
Pursuing one
Love a good time, such a good time, baby

[Hook]
Shit I won't miss a thing when I'm here
Just having fun
Cause I won't miss a thing when I'm here
Just having fun

[Bridge]
You're my one and only

[Partial Hook]
Cause I won't miss a thing when I'm here
Just having fun

Pt II

[Verse 1]
What you been up to?
Let me breathe
What you been up to?
Give me space
What you been up to?
I'm on my own
What you been up to?
Hey

[Bridge]
Oh

[Verse 2]
What you been up to?
Feeling good
What you been up to?
I can find my way
What you been up to?
Feeling fine
What you been up to?
Huh
