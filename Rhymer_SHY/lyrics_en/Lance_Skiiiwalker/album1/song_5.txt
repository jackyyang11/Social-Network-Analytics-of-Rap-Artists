[Intro: Lance Skiiiwalker]
Uh, can you bring the waiter back over here again?
She's kinda cute
Eh, what's your name?

[Verse 1: Lance Skiiiwalker]
Say baby can we dip?
So, so I can swing you by my way
Hey, we lovers on the hip
Well, well I guess I'll be  born that way
Say, that's why we skinny dip
To, a cabin in my hide away
Girl, oh
Girl, we’re lovers at heart, baby

[Hook: Lance Skiiiwalker]
So, I tip her, I tip her a few (two)
Our waitress is (cute, so)
I tip her, I tip her a few (two)
Our waitress is (cute, so)
I tip her, I tip her a few (two)
Our waitress is (cute, so)
I tip her, I tip her a few (two)
This waitress is (cute, so)

[Interlude: Lance Skiiiwalker]
I still want your number though
Please

[Beat Change]

[Verse 2: Lance Skiiiwalker]
Roses bloom, so girl why are you
Blue, baby let me take you, show you, could it be?
If it's cool, when it's cool
My hide out, baby come and run away with me
And lay low
San Pedro, where's my coupe?
Sugar, let me kiss you crazy, massage your feet
Girl it's cool, girl it's cool
We lay out, baby come and run away with me
Lock you up, find the key
To these adventures baby come around and see
Past the stars, through the trees
To a better living, baby come and grab a seat

[Outro]
Um, so when you available?
Never? Oh, okay, alright, okay bye, bye
I hope that didn't hurt you too bad
