[Hook: Lance Skiiiwalker]
I'll never be the same again
I'll never be the same again

[Verse 1: Lance Skiiiwalker]
Paris..
London..
Belgium..
I'm runnin'..
Feelin'.. one hundred
I'm Feelin' ..
I'm lovin'..
New York
Boston
Philly
Austin
Feelin' exhausted
I'm Feelin' exhausted
So I lay low
Tobago
Way low
'Till I'm able
Runnin', runnin'
To paradise
I'm runnin'
Hey
It's all about the memories darlin'
But anyway
I'm lovin'
Cause I'm lovin'
Cause I'm lovin'

[Interlude]
"Where would you like to go to Mr. Skiiiwalker"
"All stops please. How's New Zealand this time of year? Lovely? Fabulous. Um that'll be it. More tea please. Thank you, thank you."

[Hook: Lance Skiiiwalker]
I'll never be ashamed again

Feelin' exhausted
