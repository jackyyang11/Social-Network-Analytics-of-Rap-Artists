[Verse 1]
It’s kinda like everybody’s watching
Obsessing shit is real
Two pennies in my pocket
Still stressin bout her still
Still stressin life's real
Lil mama on the way
Blessings day
Still blessing this way

[Hook]
And I say
If you know what I'm talkin about
Then call me up sometime
If you know what I'm talkin about
Then call me up sometime

[Verse 2]
Mama on it's own
Mama on it's own
What you do is rad
Textin on the phone
The best little blessing
Blessing on his own

[Hook]
And I say
If you know what I'm talkin about
Then shout me out sometime
If you know what I'm talkin about
Then shout me out sometime

Hey Lance, I was just calling to let you know that the baby and I are doing good. She's kicking everyday which is a good thing and hopefully in the next two weeks when I go up for my doctor's appointment I should be able to see exactly how much she weighs and I'll send you pictures from the ultrasound. So, I was just calling to let you know that we're good and that I'll be finishing up my last fall session for grad school on the 28th, so I'll be taking my finals and work is also going well. I miss and I love you very much and I can't wait to see you when you come back, alright bye

[Outro]
If you know what I'm talkin about
I'm spread out let's speed it up
Clouds high let's leave it up
'Know what I'm talkin about
I'm spread out let's speed it up
Clouds high let's leave it up
'Know what I'm talkin about
I'm spread out let's speed it up
Clouds high let's leave it up
'Know what I'm talkin about
Dream it up
Dream it up
Dream it up
Dream it up
And I say
