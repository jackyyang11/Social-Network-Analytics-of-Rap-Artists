[Intro: Skit]
Ayy, and we're back
Thanks for staying in tune to Skiiiwalker radios
We got a couple callers on the line
Caller please state your name for us, introverted listeners
Hi, uh, my name is, uh Rebecca and this artist is kinda weird, I don't even know about his music
Exc, exc, exc, excuse me, we didn't really ask you for your fucking opinion
Would you like to hear more from this artist?
Uh, I guess, yeah, maybe

[Verse: Lance Skiiiwalker]
Baby I know you're feeling some kind of way
But baby I'm trying to say, this feeling is more than fate
And honestly, girl we're living, let's procreate
Well baby, I'm trying to say, for our future's sake
So, wouldn't you like to know, where our story goes from here?
No worries baby, have no fear
Let the music be our sound
Wouldn't you like to know where our story goes from here?
No worries baby, have no fear
Let the music be our sound for love
All away from pain
Let the music be a sound for love
Just remain the same

[Outro: Lance Skiiiwalker]
Goodbye
