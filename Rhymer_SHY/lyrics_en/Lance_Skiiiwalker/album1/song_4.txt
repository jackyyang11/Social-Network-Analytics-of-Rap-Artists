[Verse 1]
She said I clap my hands, walk my feet
It's freedom
She said we'll slide into the rhythm of this beat
It's freedom, oh

[Chorus 1]
Well, if you feel the same attraction, baby, choose
Hey, you're in for satisfaction, baby, choose

[Verse 2]
She said I smack my lips by default
No reason, da, da, da, da, da
She said I sway my hips as I walk
It's freezing, oh

[Chorus 2]
But if you feel the same attraction, lady, choose
If you're in for satisfaction, lady, choose

[Outro]
'Cause I'm in love with you for those reasons, oh
Been in love with you for the past season
And it shows, oh
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
