[Verse 1]
Forever and ever and ever and ever
Ain't no comin' back, no darlin'

[Chorus]
Now ain't that amazin'? Ain't that amazin'?
Ain't that amazin'? Well...

[Verse 2]
She took the apple, from the tree
To be with me, whoa darlin'
She said, we live forever, this ain't forbidden fruit
Cling right from the root, well...

[Chorus]
Now ain't that amazin'? Ain't that amazin'?
Ain't that amazin'? Well...
Now ain't that amazin'? Ain't that amazin'?
Ain't that amazin'? Well...

[Outro]
Damn she's always right, always right, darlin'
So I love her, damn near trust her
Got me hypnotized, hypnotized, darlin'
So I love her, damn near...
