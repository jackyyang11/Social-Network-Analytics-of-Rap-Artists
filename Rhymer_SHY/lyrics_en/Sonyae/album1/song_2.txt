[Pre]
Two tears in a bucket
They ain't on my face so fuck it
He buggin'
I hear him, don’t trust it
Cuz everything ain't worth duscussing
Ain't nothing

[Hook x2]
Fuck him, girl, fuck it [x2]
We in the club clubbin'
Fuck him, girl, fuck it

[Verse 1]
Girl he came in here late again
Like a bitch ain't tired
But if he put his mouth on me
He might get da shit wired
I done cooked, cleaned and ironed
Took pics, porno flick shit in private
Put up wit dat ghetto bullshit you tryin'
I was in ya iPhone spying, stop lying

[Pre]
Two tears in a bucket
They ain't on my face so fuck it
He buggin'
I hear him, don’t trust it
Cuz everything ain't worth duscussing
Ain't nothing

[Hook x2]
Fuck him, girl, fuck it [x2]
We in the club clubbin'
Fuck him, girl, fuck it

[Verse 2]
Roll another jay
Pop another bottle
I got his credit card
So ain't no fucking problems
Tonight my phone going on mute
He text "COME HOME" da fuck wrong wit you?
A bunch a fly niggas all on me too
I’m popping that doo doo brown, Uncle Luke
I’m drunk fuck it
And if I had a dick, suck it
Don't make me get at you in public
Now let’s get back to the subject

[Pre]
Two tears in a bucket
They ain't on my face so fuck it
He buggin'
I hear him, don’t trust it
Cuz everything ain't worth duscussing
Ain't nothing

[Hook x4]
Fuck him, girl, fuck it [x2]
We in the club clubbin'
Fuck him, girl, fuck it
