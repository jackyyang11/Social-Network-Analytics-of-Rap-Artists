[Intro]
Yesterday's storm brings today's puddles
The messed up art about that is
A new visitor won't even be able to make it to the welcome mat
Without getting mud on his shoes

[Verse 1]
We all make mistakes no one's perfect
Imma take the easy route
I wish that I could say the tears were worth it
But I would just be fooling myself

[pre Chorus]
Wish it had made me stronger
Wish I had no fear
Wish I didn't run every chance I got
Wish I wouldn't let my past
Affect my present then
Maybe I could give real love a shot oh

[[Chorus]]
You go through any storm for me
I'd rather run and find shelter
Can't bear the weight of no more rain
Ain't got no room for human error
So I'm gone always leave love before it leaves me
This road I choose is lonely but
Can't bear the weight of no more rain
Ain't got no room for human error

[Verse 2]
Oh see I can't predict a future with ya
Cause I know that joy brings pain
So Imma stay right here by myself where I know it's safe
Cause I just can't risk
Breaking down again

[Pre Chorus]
Wish love had made me stronger
Wish I had no fear
Wish I didn't run every chance I got
Wish I didn't let my past affect my present then
Maybe I could give your love a shot oh

[[Chorus]]
You go through any storm for me (oh)
I'd rather run and find shelter(I'd rather run and find shelter)
Can't bear the weight of no more rain (no, no, no)
Ain't got no room for human error (Ain't got no room for nothing no, oh)
So I'm gone always leave love before it leaves me (always baby)
This road I choose is lonely but (lonely)
Can't bear the weight of no more rain( no, no)
Ain't got no room for human error(no, no)

[Verse 3]
The damage is done
And if you're the one
Then I'll never know

Don't fall for me cause
MY heart is gone
My soul is numb I'm
Tainted and
Love
Ain't so fun no more
The damage is done
And if you're the one
I'll never know

[[Chorus]]
You go through any storm for me (I'll never know)
I'd rather run and find shelter (no no, no no, no no)
Can't bear the weight of no more rain
Don't got no room for human error (room for human error oh no no)
So I'm gone always leave love before it leaves me (no no no Always)
This road I choose is lonely but (but I)
Can't bear the weight of no more rain (Can't)
Ain't got no room for human error

[[Chorus]]
