It's to the point you love me and I love you too
But it's to the point ain't nothing further we could do
It's to the point that I know yo ass gotta go
But I'm to the point that I ain't finna stop you tho
It's to the point it's really time to say goodbye
It's to the point I'm ok with that I'll tell you why
