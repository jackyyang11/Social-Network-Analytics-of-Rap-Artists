[Verse 1: Sonyae]
Some people stay together and smile for the world
But behind closed doors cry
Some people hate eachother but coexist
Like two ships in the night

[Bridge: Sonyae]
I don't want a love that just cares for me
That's just there for me
Cause we got history
Rather have a love that's fair to me
And forever be
Willing to relight the fire when the wind blows
A little too close to the candle
That keeps our love alive

[Hook: Sonyae]
Baby
I just want to make you fall inlove with me
Over, over again
I want you to make me fall inlove with you
Over, over again

I know that you love me but
I want you to be inlove
So inlove
I'm the only thought that you think of

I just want to make you fall inlove with me
Over, over again

[Verse 2: Sonyae]
Want to get butterflies in my tummy
When somebody says your name
Want to rush and put on something sexy
And act like I been in it all day
When you say you're on your way

[Bridge: Sonyae]
I dont want someone just putting up with me
Cause we got history
Rather have a love that's fair to me
And forever be
Willing to relight the fire when the wind blows
A little too close to the candle
That keeps our love alive

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sonyae]
Some people grow together
Some grow apart
That's why staying inlove is so hard
But I'll keep reinventing the ways to make you stay
As long as you keep doing everything that got me
Here in the first place

[Hook]
