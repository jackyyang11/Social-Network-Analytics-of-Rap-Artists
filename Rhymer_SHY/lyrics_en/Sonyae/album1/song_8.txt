[Verse: Sonyae]
{uh, uh}
Leave of presence
So there's evidence I was present
God given so I represent his presence
I be preaching to the reverends
Pro'ly sound like make believe to any legend
The one, so every second
Really count me as the present
Forces truly know how I be wrecking
Even weapons feel threatened
And should ever they form
Gotta pass through my progression
Hail Mary, full of grace type of blessing {yeah}
These are my confessions
Time is of the essence
But not like magazines
How my time is of the essence
Have you feeling sixteen
By the hour deemed eleventh
Right now just get the preface
It's the most importance sentence
Because the more it's felt the more it strengthens
{whoo}
Leave of presence
So that when I leave I'll still be present
My heart won't always beat
So I record it when it speaks as a reference
Could teach you how to shine on fluorescents
Be fresher than refreshing
Or as precious as some infants
Pay attention
The terms of my expression
Mean you never have to question
Learn ya lesson
I'm such a piece of work will need helmets
The way I hold my own like a phone or a necklace
Making Debo feel pleasant
Rapping nothing different
See getting what you give makes the difference
Why I'll work til hell freeze to move heavens
For every first impression
I'll make sure I'm bearing presence
Even without acceptance, no exceptions {ha}
Leave of presence {yeah}
I'm antidepressant dope
I naturally do provoke what I emote
The antidote
Leave of presence
Not only when I spit verse
Do I only do the opposite of get worse
I lost everything and never risked worth
Since birth, my leave of presence
Been a mixing of dreams where I wonder how I sleep
And things these eyes seen would make you never wanna see
Last but not least, it's all me
And that's how there came to be... my
Leave of presence
How is spilling my intestines
Food for thought like knives through your melons
The way I'm putting vision in reflections
Please be advised {whoo}
Please be advised no discretion
{listen}
This projection
Meant to speak to the redeemed and the felons
This is kill that could never lessen
This is direction for my sisters and my brethren
This is will my most valuable possession
This is my leave of presence
This is my leave of presence
And you're so very welcomed
To be in my leave presence
This is my leave of presence
This is my leave of presence
Really you're so very welcomed
To be in my leave of presence
This is my leave of presence
This is my leave of presence
Leave of presence
