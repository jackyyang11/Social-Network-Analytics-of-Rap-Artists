[Intro]
You see, relationships can be a funny, funny thing
When you first start out, everything is cool
Everything is fun, but then that nigga gets comfortable
(Oh yeah, he's gonna get comfortable)
Then he has you fucked up
So you know what you gotta tell that nigga?
(Listen)

[Chorus]
Don’t be a head ass
Don’t be a head ass nigga
Don’t be a head ass
Don’t be a head ass nigga to me
To me, to me, to me, to me
To me, to me, to me, to me
Don't be a head ass
(Don't be a head ass nigga to me, forreal)
Don't be a head ass nigga
(Cause if I'm here for you, please don't take your frustrations out on me)
Don't be a head ass
(You know what I'm saying? like, just keep it real, just keep it real)
Don't be a head ass nigga to me
To me (you ain't gotta lie), to me (you ain't gotta lie), to me (you ain't gotta lie), to me
To me (to me), to me (to me), to me (to me), to me
