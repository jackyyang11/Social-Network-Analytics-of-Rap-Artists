You can hate me now
But I won't stop now
Or in the near future
I can't give ho niggas the satisfaction
To touch it, smack it, or grab it
Let alone have it
I came to wreak havoc
Break chains and latches
I'm now liberated
Can't give a fuck what a hater stated
You can play silver rated
Now chasing dreams while steady pacing
Face it like a doobie
My nigga, you losing
I been the under, bitch
So, hear my point
And I'm proving niggas wrong
Rapping that same song over Ty beats
Now these niggas digging me like I'm six-feet
Under the Earth's crust
I'm a must like deodorant
If you mad, cry a river, build a bridge, get over it
Drown your own sorrows but I probably won't throw no floaties in
They say I'm rapping like I think I got it
Well, bitch, that's because I think I got it
Your self-esteem issues are not my fucking problem
If feeling my damn self is wrong well fuck it, then I'm cocky
These are fauxreign threats
Nigga, fauxreign threats
These are foreign-
These are fucking foreign threats so watch your mother fucking neck
