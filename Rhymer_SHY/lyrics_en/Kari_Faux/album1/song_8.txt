[Intro: Foxy Brown (1974)]
You think you're back in with those people, but you got a stick of dynamite up your ass and the fuse is burning, you understand? Now I want you out. (Oh you...) Who does she think she is? Well thats my sister baby, and she's a whole 'lotta woman

[Man]
Yo, so whats you're name?
[Kari]
Kari Faux, as if you didn't know
I'm the spunky chick with the natural curly fro

[Man]
And where you from?
[Kari]
Arkansas, Little Rock to be exact
Where the bitches keep attitudes
And them niggas stay strapped
[Man]
So, Whatchu do?
[Kari]
Break rules, and said fuck school
Now I Bust flows over beats to make your body move
This is me, no apologies, so sit  back while I kick this Fauxlosophy

[Kari Verse]
Nigga I'm the dopest the coldest the do-it in my section
Them nigga's that you want are the ones I be neglectin'
Don't box me in with basic hoes, I'm different, just deceptive
Don't believe what you see on TV it's a weapon of mass deception
I'm perceptive, eclectic, connected and respected
No love for feeble minded hoes, I can't fuck with them skeptics
They wastin' precious  time trying to figure out my method
Dont watch me, watch yourself and up your game
You need to step it
Im from a small town where nigaas was known to bang on streets
But see, me, I would much rather bang up on these beats and maintain the peace, by any means Like a mix between Malcom X and Martin Luther King
There's a really thin line between love and hate, real and fake, you actin niggas musta missed your take
The seasons up, the show was canceled, cause the ratings was low
If you call that being real, then I'd rather be, Faux
