[Verse 1]
Surprise, surprise
Your girl is back on the grind
Losing sleep for the paper, designer bags on my eyes
See me in the newspaper, they see that I'm on the rise
And if you see me in the whip I bet I'm bumping some Tribe
Could be bumping "check the rhime" like a million times
And if you buying me a drink I want Bud Light with a lime
Bitches talking that shit, I come around in they minds
And I done made it through the storm so ima stunt and do time like

[Hook x2]
Gah damn I知 the muthafucking shit
Gah damn I知 the muthafucking shit
Word around town, I知 that fucking bitch
Word around town, I知 that fucking bitch

[Verse 2]
Fuck a trend, I知 clean when I ain't trying to be
You see me nigga? I知 who your bitch is trying to be
I知 riding with a foreign nigga named Fresco
And we fresh ho, with no dress code
I see you gassed up, yeah you all wrapped up
That痴 how you get passed up, while you run laps bruh
Pop goes the bitch thought she fucking with me
Now she pop that pussy to pay off them parking fees

Hook x2

[Verse 3]
Who are these niggas with these tired ass rhymes?
Who share the same clothes, and flip the same dimes?
Who sold one gram now they think that they hard
奏il a nigga come and decide to pull they ho card

Who is these hoes with these tired ass flows?
Who wear matching outfits and shop at Rainbow
Who done boxed one bitch now they think that they hard
奏il a bitch come and decide to pull they ho card

Hook x2
