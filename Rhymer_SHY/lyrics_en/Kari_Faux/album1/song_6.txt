[Intro]
*Sound of phone vibrating*
Why are you calling?

[Pre Chorus]
I don't mean to be facetious
'Cause I see that you've been trying to reach me
Saw your call was urgent (I saw your call baby)
But I missed that shit on purpose

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna deal right now (not right now)
I don't wanna talk it out (We can't talk it out)
I don't wanna deal right now (Deal right now)
I don't wanna talk it out (We can't talk it out)
I don't wanna deal right now (Deal right now)
I don't wanna talk it out (We can't talk it out)
I don't wanna deal right now (Deal right now)
I don't wanna talk it out (We can't talk it out)

[Verse 1]
Just please stop calling me 'cause you been having yo' fun (You been having yo' fun)
Runnin' 'round town with a girl that can't even keep her hair done (Even keep her hair done)
Tonight is therapy, I'll dance away my problems (Dance away my problems)
Might even find a cutie, might even just fuck someone (Might even just fuck someone)
But right now babe, I'm on the dance floor feeling vibrant (Feeling vibrant)
You thought I would sit at home, waiting for you crying
Thought you was a Leo, 'cause I swear that you stay lying (I swear that you stay lying)
Let's go our separate ways and let bygones be bygones


[Pre Chorus]
I don't mean to be facetious
'Cause I see that you've been trying to reach me
Saw your call was urgent (I saw your call baby)
But I missed that shit on purpose

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna deal right now (not right now)
I don't wanna talk it out (We can't talk it out)
I don't wanna deal right now (Deal right now)
I don't wanna talk it out (We can't talk it out)
I don't wanna deal right now (Deal right now)
I don't wanna talk it out (We can't talk it out)
I don't wanna deal right now (Deal right now)
I don't wanna talk it out (We can't talk it out)
