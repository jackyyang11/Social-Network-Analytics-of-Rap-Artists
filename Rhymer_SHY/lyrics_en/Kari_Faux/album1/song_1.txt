[Verse 1]
See I really dig your tone
Did you get the telepathic text message that I sent to your phone?
We're both barely grown
But I know what I like
Say the word and it's on
Can't get you out my head
The deepest shade of red
Sometimes the coolest blue
Or a mix of the two
Your aura match mine
So I had to choose you
My love kaleidoscope
Come and let me change your view

[Hook: Kari Faux + Leven Kali]
I'm feeling your color
Come feel it, babe
Come feel it, babe
I'm feeling your color
Come feel it, babe
Come feel it, babe
And it's next to mine
I'm feeling your color
I feel it, babe
I feel it, babe
I'm feeling your color
I feel it, babe
And it's next to mine

[Verse 2]
You always bring the sunshine
We be up to the sunrise
Prettiest color seen by my eyes
With a stroke of dedication
A little bit of patience
You'll see the bigger picture that we painting
Don't turn down your brightness
I love your saturation
Fill up your cup
Can we get a little faded
To be next to you is a moment I savor
I want this forever
So don't leave me hanging

[Bridge: Leven Kali]
I ain't talkin' bout [?]
I ain't talkin' bout skin
I'm talkin' bout us
I ain't talkin' bout lust
Girl, I'm talkin bout this

[Hook: Kari Faux + Leven Kali]
I'm feeling your color
Come feel it, babe
Come feel it, babe
I'm feeling your color
Come feel it, babe
Come feel it, babe
And it's next to mine
I'm feeling your color
I feel it, babe
I feel it, babe
I'm feeling your color
I feel it, babe
And it's next to mine
