[Verse 1: Kari Faux]
I'm back up in this bitch, just like I climb back in the YouTube hits
Big body writhe and scream watching coolin ish
You know that I ain't new to this, matter fact I'm true to this
Tryna to figure out my method, man you must be fo-o-olish
Presidential tint on the whip, they askin' who is this?
Posted up at the red light, we watching Stanley Kubrick flicks
[?]
Boys be talkin down but they be running the place
You be out here wylin for respect, demand, I can relate
Don't be askin' no questions, cause this ain't no debate
My, my love, have you seen her, seen her
Candy pearled excursion [?]
Please, sit back and relax, you can pour up the drink, as I roll up the -dex
Split the vega good and fill it, pass that in rotation till that bitch is missing

[Hook: Kari Faux and Black Party]
Screams fall as I creep and I crawl
Riding through your hood knockin pictures off the, wall
Screams fall as I creep and I crawl
Riding through your hood, knocking pictures off the, wall

[Verse 2: Black Party]
They say, Black a musician, nah, Black a magician
And top disappear like a magic trick, hashing chick
I dont ever ever be on average shit
I be crackin crackin on the seal like an activist
Like a marijuana activist, roll that shit and pass the
Somebody rather tell these niggas that i am beyond greatness
I am vesubvius, destroy you like Pompeii
Floodin the streets with all this candy paint
I'm asking these niggas: Can you stand the rain??
Told the world about two years ago this shit is not a game, a lot of men want a lot of money and a lotta women want fame
The difference bewtween me and everyone else, is no-one can stop my train
Young based god, when I swing down come aruond and catch a blessin

[Hook: Kari and Black]
Screams fall as I creep and I crawl...
Riding through the hood, knockin pictures off the, wall
Riding through your hood knocking pictures off the wall
