[Verse 1]
You compliment me so well, I had to go tell my friends all about this color that look good with mine
He calls me yellow 'cause he say I always bring the sunshine
My future baby's be the reason that I stay on my grind
But in the mean time I collect coins and stack green
Crisp blue faces take me places that I've never seen
Bold and attractive I'm starting to think that he's red
I sent him telegraphic messages so he leave words unsaid

Oooooh
Oooooh

And I said I'm feelin yo' color, yeah
I'm feelin' yo' color yeah, I'm feelin' yo' color's right next to mine
I said I'm diggin' yo color, yeah
I'm diggin' yo' color, yeah, I'm diggin yo' color's right next to mine (I'm diggin yo' color's right next to mine)
