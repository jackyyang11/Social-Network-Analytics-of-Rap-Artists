I remember the last day, that I seen your face
Your time was fading away
If I would've known it, I would've told you to stay
Please don't go 'cause I love you
But it was too late, too soon
And now you got me saying

I miss you, yeah yeah
I miss you
I know you're looking out for me from heaven
I know you're surrounded by His loving
You're my angel watching from above
And I'm never gonna let no one ever take your place

Everybody's put on this earth for a purpose
I know some people who be asking God "Why?"
(Why are they here)
'Cause you're here to live your life
And to spread love till you die

Hold on (hold on), be strong (be strong)
Just know there's always one day
We all got to move on
Have faith (have faith) 'cause one day
I can't wait to see your face again
I miss my best friend

I miss you (I miss you)
I miss you (I miss you)
I know you're looking out for me from heaven
I know you're surrounded by His loving
You're my angel watching from above
And I'm never gonna let no one ever take your place

One day you're here baby
Then you're gone (gone, gone)
Just know there's always one day
We all got to move on
Have faith (have faith) 'cause one day
I can't wait to see your face again
I miss my best friend

I miss you (I miss you)
Yes I do (I miss you)
I know you're looking out for me from heaven
(When I see you smiling)
I know you're surrounded by His loving
You're my angel watching from above
And I'm never gonna let no one ever take your place

(I miss you)
I miss you [x2]
I know you're looking out for me from heaven
I know you're surrounded by His loving
You're my angel watching from above
And I'm never gonna let no one ever take your place
