[Verse 1: SPZRKT]
Latey the sky is on the ground
And i use the sun to cool me down
I take a shower then get dirty
And every kind word seems to hurt me
Go on red, stop on green
Yellow just makes me pick up speed
I buy the world without a penny
Who needs the pain? cuz i've got plenty

[Chorus]
But You, You can change it all
Change it all
But You, You can change it all
Change it all

Do you believe it? yeah! [x8]


[Verse 2: SPZRKT]
Lately the young is looking old
And it seems I've lost all of control
I fill my heart but still i'm empty
And all my loved ones just resent me
Well i do believe in something more
Cuz You pick my head up off the floor
You cover me through all the rainfall
And You remind me just to stay strong

[Chorus]

[vamp]
You can, change it
Change it, all
[x2]

[Bridge: SPZRKT]
All my friends done let me down
It hits the fan and it hits the ground
All my lucks in a different town
Maybe i need something different now
Maybe i'll take up the Gift of Life
You give me hope when You give the Light
Tired of trying to live the life
But You give me love and i'm feeling right

[Outro]

But You, You can change it all
Change it all
But You, You can change it all
Change it all

Yeah! Yeah!
You can change it!
You can change it!
You can change it!
Only You, only You ohhh!
