[Intro]
In its different way, this has its own magic

[Verse 1: SPZRKT]
I've got tired of chasing off your lazy loving ways
If that's love I'm breaking off
You're crazy as they say
My friends never ever did like you for me
And it's no mystery of why

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not thinking of you when i'm thinking of my life
I'm not thinking of you when i'm thinking of my life (ohh)
I'm not thinking of you when i'm thinking of my life (ohh)
I'm not thinking of you when i'm thinking of my life

[Chorus]
I gotta live without you. I'm better off without you
I gotta live without you. I'm better off without you
I gotta live without you. I'm better off without you
I gotta live without you. I'm better off without you
Oh-oh-oh. hey!

[Verse 2: SPZRKT]
I've got tired of reading lies you text me everyday
Apologizing every night
You're crazy as they say
I shouldn't be thinking that we could be
I'll do much better otherwise

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[outro]
(ohhhhh-oh-ohhhhh-oh
Ohhhhh-oh-ohhhhh-oh)
I gotta live without you
I'm better off without you
I gotta live without you
I'm better off without you
Ohhh
