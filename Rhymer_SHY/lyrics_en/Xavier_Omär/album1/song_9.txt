[Verse 1: SPZRKT]
I've gathered all the pieces of Your love
That i could find i bet i'll never find them all
In my lifetime
And Your love has lit a, a fire within me
I'll never let it down, down, down
I wonder how i've kept this all inside

[Pre-Chous]
And the world will know i love You
And the world will know You love me too
And i wonder why You never left my side
And the world will know i love You
And the world will know You love me too
And i'll carve our names in wood, lit by the fire

[Chorus]
Our love burns through the night
[x4]

[Verse 2: SPZRKT]
I try to give you back all of Your love
And though i try, i bet i'll never give it all
In my lifetime
Your love has lit a, a fire within me
You'll never let it down, down, down
I wonder how i've kept this all inside

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Chant]

[outro]
Your love has lit a , a fire within me
I'll never it let it down, down, down, down
[x2]
