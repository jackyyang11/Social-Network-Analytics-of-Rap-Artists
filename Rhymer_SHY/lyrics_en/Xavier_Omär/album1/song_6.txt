You only give me the best that you have
Woo, your grace give me things I don't deserve
I didn't earn it
I think I'm worthless, yeah

You took me from the bottom
And told me I'm the head
I didn't give you nothing, you gave me love instead
I can't just keep in all this love
Without giving it back to you

The best of my love

You only give me the best that you have, ohh

Your ways of loving
I just can't keep it to myself, yeah

You took me from the bottom
And told me I'm the head
I didn't give you nothing, you gave me grace instead
And all across the dance room floor (all across the dance room floor)
Party rocking and we sing

You get the best of my love
You loved me first
You gave me the best of your love
You loved me first
You give me the best of your
