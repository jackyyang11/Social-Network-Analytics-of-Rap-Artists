Verse 1
When you're young I'm suffering from being so impatient. Its like the older I get my chances of winning fading
Watching everyone around me finally take their places
You can't be a doctor my nigga if you ain't got the patients
This is my life and I don't know where to take it
I used to wish that where I go all the women was naked. But now that I'm older know that I finally notice. Age taught how to spot a wolf sitting in sheep clothing. Some nights were just darker than it ever was. I can't see my hand in front of my face. Who to trust. Remember when all these people around us didn't fuck with us. Ryan told me be myself and watch how they come to us. So I'm waiting here
Cause i saw the light I can see the dark
It could be hard to see in your neighborhood
Or any block
Life is like a switch it goes on and off and it never stops
I understand why momma wanted me inside

Chorus
6 o'clock (Devvon) 6 o'clock 6 o'clock
When them lights come on you on your own
Cause it's dark outside
6 o'clock (Devvon) 6 o'clock 6 o'clock
When them lights come on you on your own
Cause it's dark outside

It's Time to come home are you lost now
When the sun goes down
Not a sound
It's Time to come home are you lost now
When the sun goes down
Not a sound

6 o'clock

6 o'clock

(Devvon)
