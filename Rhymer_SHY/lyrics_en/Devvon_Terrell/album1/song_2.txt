[Verse 1]
I never thought you'd be one of my exes
I never thought that we would wake up with so much invested
It's crazier to even think of the people you sexing
You live your life and I live mine but still I be guessing
You told me things about yourself that you never told your friends
Got me thinking like what did I tell you that you could be telling them
I wonder what you telling your parents
I wonder what you telling your brothers and sisters about my disadvantages
Like I wonder why he not coming ‘round
I wonder why every time you say his name, you refuse a smile
I think about it way more than I really should
And I don't follow you on shit because I know I never could
See you with another nigga, drinking with another man
I rolled your first L for you baby you remember when
Time was of the essence it was always on our side
And you broke the clock and said you needed time fuck the other side
Yeah, like when did you finally decide
That everything we worked for would crumble up and just die
What was the situation that finally had you erasing
Like all of the love from me it's crazy I saw you cry like why it was your decision
Now who was the person that fed you with all these lies and all in our fucking business?
I wonder where you at not only physically but mentally I'm thinking when we get it back

[Chorus]
Go (go) go (go) go (go)
Tell me where to go
Baby tell me who what when and why you said goodbye
I just wanna know, know, know know

[Verse 2]
You should see me now my whole life has changed
Been on TV the radio I'm rising oh can you hear me now, I know you have
And I could probably guess that your friends was right behind you saying to turn me down
Why you let em' do that to you?
Why you let em' take advantage of something that they could never manage
Crazy how you taking advice from someone that failed at it
Knowing damn well if they had it that they would never pass it, yeah
Hate to say it, but it is what it is all the semesters that fucking stressed you
All the books I bought you that was me invested
Had a 9 to 5 but sometimes you needed more, so I would bless you
Well here goes nothing, a mother fucking waste, I wish I said that to your face
I found out from my fucking sisters you was fucking other niggas
That's crazy, cause I almost let you have that baby

[Chorus]
Go (go) go (go) go (go)
Tell me where to go
Baby tell me who what when
