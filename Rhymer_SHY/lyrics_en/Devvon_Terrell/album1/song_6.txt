[Chorus]
I like my girls bad and boujee
Cookin' up dope with an Uzi, yeah
Haters is savage ruthless
30's and 100 rounds too
I like my girls bad and boujee
Cookin' up dope with an Uzi, yeah
Haters is savage ruthless
30's and 100 rounds too

[Verse 1]
Raindrop, drop top
I be making spends for you like I'm Maybach, yeah
You be stuntin', you be frontin' on me
But baby you can't be for real
Bad and boujee is the crime you wanted
Guessing that this is my testimony
Killing me because you never stay
That's why I leave, kumbaya
You be stuntin' like a 750
And your competition soft like Hello Kitty
Yeah you're bad and boujee but you're hella pretty
You're not picking a winner like Remy, Nicki
Taking my shot down
Taking that shot and my shots down
I hate it, I love it
I better be working for something

[Chorus]
I like my girls bad and boujee
Cookin' up dope with an Uzi, yeah
Haters is savage ruthless
30's and 100 rounds too
I like my girls bad and boujee
Cookin' up dope with an Uzi, yeah
Haters is savage ruthless
30's and 100 rounds too
