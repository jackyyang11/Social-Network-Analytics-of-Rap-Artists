[Hook]
That girl was a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know me
Young fool living like a old geezer
Release the cash, watch it fall slowly

[Verse]
Black Beatles, black Beatles
Don't play with you monkeys
I'm hearing and seeing no evil
Biggest challenge is to call you my friend
That's why when you say Devv I stay still like a mannequin
Man I don't know you
Why are you constantly watching a kid up on all of your socials?
Hated on me when I needed hands
Now I got greens, beans, potatoes, tomatoes, and lamb
God damn, God damn, still don't give me the attention
Tell all your people to listen
I'm on the water right now but one day I'll be fishin'
I'm makin' all the decisions
You say that you da boss well I'm gon' give you the business
And I don't discriminate on any women
Go for Yoko Ono like I'm John Lennon

[Hook]
That girl was a real crowd pleaser
