[Chorus]
Twisted, smokin', faded
Shouldn’t talk right now
Jealous, you and me don't exist, baby I'm cool
Right now I say "Fuck all this shit"
It’s 4 in the morning

[Verse 1]
Don't wanna talk about it
I had to leave you at home, had to tell you about yourself
'Cause you bringing up all the old shit
Who is she and why is she hitting you up?
Last time you did this shit
You wind up finding it was nothing up
Men have no voice in this situation
'Cause I look like the bad guy
Really you need to change
Just think about it
You always say that niggas just ain't shit
But every time we have a problem, it's about a chick
A girl knows how to get you mad and push your buttons
I just wish that you never let them get in your head
But it's always coming back to me
But really you just gotta trust your man
And know just what he'll never be
A dog ass nigga with another life
Not saying that I’m perfect, but I’m living right
It's hard to balance my relationship
And once I tell her that you mad
She’ll probably go off and talk her shit
Like I got this girl mad, oh this shit is sad
I can probably get em now 'cause she insecure
It's not possible because I know better
Got a good girl at home, it gets no better
But when you tell me to tell her to stop calling and texting
It makes you look weakened like a wolf you see her teeth
'Cause now she know she got yo ass
She know we arguing
She know I’m vulnerable and probably getting no ass
You creating the setting, and you setting the mood
For her to just make moves on your man
That wasn't part of your plan
But goddamn here we stand
In the puddle of our love
You should just trust me
That's what real love be
I know you've got a past
But that's why I feel lucky
You doing exactly what she just wants you to do
She yelling your mind
And that's why we're gonna lose, fuck

[Chorus]
Twisted, smokin', faded
Shouldn't talk right now
Jealous, you and me don't exist, baby I'm cool
Right now I say "Fuck all this shit"
It's 4 in the morning
And I just left the crib, I need to get cold

[Verse 2]
You know that I would give you every dolla
You realize I'm investing in to you
I'm helping you pay for your college
Tuition is a bitch, but I know you worth it
Could've been driving a Maserati
Baby girl nothing could stop me
That's not my swag, you know that
That's why I get so mad when you question loyalty
Like I never show that
I find it funny how girls click up
On a guy when it's really the girl you shouldn't trust
You tell your friends "Damn girl I'm in love"
"This nigga treat me like a queen and always picking me up"
And they write it down 'cause in the back of they mind
Said if you fuck it up then that nigga is mine
That's how we met, you met me when I was at my worst
See me picking her up and sending flowers to work
And she fucked up, know that you noticed
Not saying it's planned
You just opened up your notes and said this nigga dope
So let's break this cycle
Black and white like I was Michael
History repeats itself, so don't let other girls hype you
You keep your enemies close, but your friends closer
Try to give you some light, and then they run you over
And now you're on a roll all by yourself
Living in a puddle of love, you don't need a boat
'Cause you already dead off of what other people done said
When really you just should've trusted me instead

[Chorus]
Twisted, smokin', faded
Shouldn't talk right now
Jealous, you and me don't exist, baby I'm cool
Right now I say "Fuck all this shit"
It's 4 in the morning
And I just left the crib, I need to get cold
