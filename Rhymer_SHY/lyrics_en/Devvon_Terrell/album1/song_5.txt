[Hook]
A nigga really wanna be with you girl (no, no, no)
But I don't really want to live in your world (no, no, no)
Young nigga never been with a good girl (no, no, no)
Tell me how to live with a good girl (I don't know, know)
I don't want to limit
I have been fucking around with these other bitches (no, no, no)
I admit it, I admit it
I have been thinking about other girls when I'm in it (no, no, no)

[Verse 1]
I got a chick in her ride
I'm her nigga on the side (no, no, no)
She got another nigga but I'm doing something right (no, no, no)
Another one only called her nigga on the weekends (no, no, no)
'Cause she works so hard all week
But she calls me baby, wanna sleep in
I don't want to give these girls away (no, no)
I got nothing on the rebound
If you don't stay
Aurora borealis baby, everything is changed now
I love you, but I never say it
You exist, but I don't really know how
Aurora borealis baby, everything is changed now
I love you, but I never say it
You exist, but I don't really know how
