[Hook]
They say this is a big, rich town
I just come from the poorest part
Bright lights, city life, I gotta make it
This is where it goes down, yeah
And I just come from the poorest part
Legal or illegal, baby, I gotta make it

[Verse 1]
Fourth season of Power, now this is getting crazy
Never see it coming like Ghost and his third baby
Tariq is really flexing, catching, [?] holding weapons
Had to lose his sister to finally learn a lesson
She's gone, Tasha gon' be fucked up
Prolly calling Terry on the low for the house call
Earrings on the house floor
Ghost is on the dance floor
And she looking at him like she just want a little more
She can't take it, no
Like Ghost, oh why you test me?
Fuck around and have a baby like Tony Taresi, yeah
They think he a boss, yeah
'Bout to take a loss
Thinking that [?]
[?]
Pray you not a doctor, Tommy not acting proper
'Cause he has proctor
Ain't nobody singin'
If not, you gettin' shot
That's why when you stop the music from a jukebox
It's like a [?] recap
Season 5, oh I need that
The Living Weirdo on Power
I think I really see that
Young boy from Brooklyn
[?]
Make the city proud
And that's words to my mother

[Hook]
This is a big, rich town, yeah
I just come from the poorest part
Bright lights, city life, I gotta make it
This is where it goes down, yeah
