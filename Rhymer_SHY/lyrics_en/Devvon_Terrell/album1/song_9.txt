Said that you want to be more than friends and I get it

I'm just trying to chill with ya like ice in a cold winter
I know what you looking for, the word is gorilla

['03 Bonnie & Clyde by Jay-Z ft. Beyonce]
King Kong ain't got nothing on me
Climb to the top and you gon' see
Know you want more what could it be
Stop running around and just look for me
Young, free cruising down the west side
I treat you like you treat you selfies, I show my best side
Sometime I be thinking you too good believe me, but I'm willing to put in work like I'm Drake and you RiRi
I got a feeling you needed me but you not gonna say it
I'm gonna give you the juice, call it the food to my label
You know that you ten out of ten and I made my decision
It's me and my girlfriend

Get in trouble for a nigga like you Kim K

[Summer Rain by Carl Thomas]
Feeling like the summer rain, don't you ever take my son away
Got no kids or let me explain, talking about that thing thats wake me in the morning
When it's freezing cold you come up and it's warmer
Got you on the cover, making you happy know that's a habit
Pulling things out of nowhere like go go gadget
Seeing you in my future, I can't go passed it
Having you in my presence, I cannot wait it have it
One of these days, I'mma make you mine
Nothing to say, it just takes time
You like the summer rain and I don't feel the same

Shorty so loud that the neighbors know my name yes yous
Ooh, I would never lose you, say they want your mom, but they really wanna do you
Say that they can take you, I say homie do you
