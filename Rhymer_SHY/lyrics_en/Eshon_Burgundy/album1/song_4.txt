[Hook: Eshon Burgundy]
Bless ya name, bless ya name, bless ya name Lord (3x)
They want your throne they must be all the way insane God
Bless ya name, bless ya name, bless ya name Lord (3x)
They want your crown they must be all the way insane God

[Verse 1: Eshon Burgundy]
2 Timothy 2:3 is important yup
Way more important than the 2-3 on these Jordan's yup
Young degenerates with a membership
Ex-orphans when the Winter Springs the Summer Falls, Lord bless the autumn
You paint a facade they claims you're God I beg your pardon
You couldn't spar with the morning star, He's every star in orbit
And you a flicker you get your shine from His shine, you a trigger without a clip
And He a AK 47 without a off switch
Blaow! Blaow! You a picture, He a portrait
You a match, He the all consuming flame on top our torches
The Father of mother Earth and baby girl was gorgeous
Until the sin of man destroyed the symmetry in all this
Then the Son of man absorbed the penalties and charges
God had this problem solved before the fall like August
God is your God, you praying the President would take his office
I can't even reach you use your weak lines to even lace my forces
How dare you open up your trap and yap about His throne
Using the mouth He gave you and the heart He let you hold
Your language is neglectful in the presence of a King
You lacking honor your blasphemy is a comma
In the sentence of repentance, coasting left like California
Hold your breath until there's nothing left before you disrespect His honor
Them false pictures of Christ got you thinking Son is soft
Son ain't soft, Son wanna son you all cause Son is God

[Hook: Eshon Burgundy]
Bless ya name, bless ya name, bless ya name Lord (3x)
They want your throne they must be all the way insane God
Bless ya name, bless ya name, bless ya name Lord (3x)
They want your crown they must be all the way insane God

[Verse 2: Th3 Saga]
Lamentations 3:50 is what I seek dog
More important than these 350s' on my feet dog
They sending flames at the names of the most elite dog
I'm Norris Cole with such a dormant soul, I'll take the heat God
They don't even know your peace, they holding peace up in these streets God
The sick made the kids book like its Leap Frog
The enemy wants us to fall victim to deceit God
Purified us, but some claim the blood foul like a street bum
But we are, sons of the lamb, child of the Holy Father
But think we in control like a pot of clay tryna remold the potter
Can't even fathom His greatness, but I peep your whole persona
Focus your lens tryna pan the future, I know designers
Just need the world to be open minded in hopes of finding
The man who said it was finished, died and He broke the climate
Fulfilled the purpose of prophesies when they wrote the promise
Took the keys from satan and rose, completing both assignments
I remembered them nights my boy hustled out by that Dollar Tree
Pushing white, flashing gold for the green, boy that's idolatry
We ain't tryna to hear all that mess, boy why you bother me
If you ain't talking birds or the 'gram then why you follow me
I'm doing whatever I can to make it real for you
Called to be the fishers of men so I brought the real for you
No matter the circumstance God the Father is still for you
But they paralyzed to His name, dog I feel for you

[Hook: Th3 Saga]
Bless ya name, bless ya name, bless ya name Lord (3x)
They want your crown they must be all the way insane God
Bless ya name, bless ya name, bless ya name Lord (3x)
They want your crown they must be all the way insane God
