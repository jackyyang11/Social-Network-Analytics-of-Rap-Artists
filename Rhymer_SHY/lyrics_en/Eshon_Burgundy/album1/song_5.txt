[Hook]
Blood Money
Blood Money
Blood Money, Money
He paid for it all in blood
That’s the price of love
Blood Money
Blood Money
Blood Money, Money
He paid for it all in blood
I knew You would

[Verse 1]
Yo I took a moment to adjust my lenses
I know my broken language and my culture so offensive to some
Try to condense it try to chop it down by inches
But I can't help but remember being defenseless hopping fences from guns
The Lord ain't my witness I'm the witness His glory shine
Compare His glory to mine  and mine looks counterfeited
Get it I must admit it
When it comes to flipping the script I am a gymnast
Lord I'm just amazed that you are still in this
Isn't this just like
A ghetto boy
To be in need of help
But some of y'all need to agree
Then look at me and see yourself
Cause I can blame myself for every bad card that's being dealt
Still blame somebody else for every bar that's being felt
That's God I tried but can't give this credit to no one else
Knew that even when I was dreaded and talking knowledge of self
Clear-headed
Treated the streets like it was college itself
I'm still thankful though we disagree on God, women and wealth I’m on that

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yo And I know the importance of being brave hearted
Getting my courage up before I get my day started
Still kneeling while fighting the feeling not to
If this is not you and you not an apostle
Then pray for it
If you listening to this song just know I prayed on it
My life’s no longer mine it belongs to who paid for it
1st Corinthians for the ones toting that lithium
That's verse 6:20 The revised version of getting money
No cursin I'm speaking blessings with each confession
Rehearsin and reflectin on the cross and my connection
I've been paid for
It’s what my mother prayed for
And that ain't me that's His majesty you throwing shade on
But then again that's only right
Cause He shinin bright
Brighter than the police lights at night when they pull me over
Thought I caught a body
Probably identified me blindly
Would somebody kindly remind them that I'm soakin in that

[Hook]

[Hook #2]
DNA all over my trouble and pain
Wash the dirt off of my soul and discover the name
Might've seen me shed a tear if
I ain't cover my face
Until the balance is paid, ain't none of us safe
