[Intro: Parade]
Deliver us from the shadows of the ungodly
Freedom, freedom, freedom, freedom
March, march, march along to redemption song
Freedom, freedom, freedom, freedom

[Verse 1: Eshon Burgundy]
I rise in the morning hit my knees and take it up one time
There was a time in my life when they had me stuck one time
The lead still in me from when they came to light me up one time
No ambulances in sight patrol officers write me up one time
Look at my momma I say momma I am gonna die
She look back at me and said no baby now that's a lie
Right after that i swear i heard a voice come from the sky
Sound like the voice of God and He said you're not gonna die
This won't be the day you go into the ground
I got angels all around you here to hold you down
Heard you cry out from heaven I can hear the sound
You may not see me but believe me I'm always around

[Hook: Eshon Burgundy]
You chose me before I chose you
I don't know much but I know you
I said in paradise please remember me
Then you spared me and delivered me
Oh, was it because I believed
Cause I don't know what I believe
But i know eternity's inside you
And I cannot deny you

[Verse 2: Eshon Burgundy]
Yo, when I was younger I almost went out with a bang
Before I was born I know that Lord you knew my name
Destined for love, predestined for war and pain
Present to one day make the confession we are redeemed
Gave you my life not for the blessing in exchange
But the profession of love for me that you made
For the Father you hung between two thieves on center stage
After three days you were raised and called for the release of all the slaves
Especially for the guilty ones like myself
The healing has begun for the filthy ones can't you tell
We was to die for, He took the nails and made the cell, His rot
And against it the gates of hell shall not prevail
Of victim of 8 shells, three went in, five fell
People prayed and I was almost layed to rest but I was saved
Passed over the smell of fear I no longer know that aroma
All I know is if we believe his mercy lie upon us
I'm free

[Hook]
You chose me before I chose you
I don't know much but I know you
I said in paradise please remeber me
Then You spared me and delivered me
Was it because I believed
Please help my unbelief
And I know eternity's inside you
I cannot deny You

[Verse 3]
As a youngin I watched you answer my mother's prayers
It built my faith cause other people said you wasn't there
Their sky dwellers a watch my sky dweller's my pops
False idols, jealousy alive and they can't tell us he not
Live by a code royalty in the robe
Diplomacy and blood, currency we are exposed
Lion and the lamb obediently died and rose
Significant to me because I was one of his foes
Broad daylight when the reaper came for my soul
Eager to get me ether either that or see me fold
He don't know refining fires required to see the gold
And putting pressure on me only make me a testimony told
For my homies from Philly to State road
Wrongfully accused or rightly in the hole
You can be forgiven if you repent and believe
Even most civilians don't know the feeling of being free
Indeed

[Outro: Parade]
Separated from the greatest you already know separated for the greatest you already know
Separated for the greatest you already know (You already know)
Separated for the greatest you already know
Separated for the greatest you already know
Separated for the greatest you already know (You already know)
Separated yeah

[Hook: Eshon Burgundy]
You chose me before I chose you
I don't know much but I know you
I said in paradise please remeber me
Then You spared me and delivered me
Was it because I believed
Please help my unbelief
And I know eternity's inside you
I cannot deny You
