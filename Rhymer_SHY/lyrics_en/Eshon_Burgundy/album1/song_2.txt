[Hook: Eshon Burgundy]
I can't put you in a box
Why would I try?
I ain't got enough words in my stash to describe
I'm just down here on the earth
Lookin at the sky
Observin the distance that exists between You and I
How are You so high?
And so low?
Down here wit me
Yet you’re light years beyond the globe
They must turn around(on you)
Cause they don't know How do you turn your back
On something that beautiful?
So distant Yet close

[Verse 1: Eshon Burgundy]
I never bought the lie they was sellin
I'd rather eat the truth
From the tree of life
Not the forbidden fruit
The two were in the same vicinity
And the enemy knew
Then innocence became a memory
And Adam was removed
Then The Lord revoked their access
To that life-givin juice
Until plenty years later when
Christ was re-introduced
And now those who partake
Are the ones that hunger for the truth
That the Lord
Within in His mercy gave the world a round two
Now who you know would do something like dat?
Who show that much love?
I'm hustling everlasting life packs
Let me give you my plug
I'm from the mud
I was on the concrete covered in blood
Seconds away from complete separation from above
I know you good God
All the way from Heaven to my hood God
Saved me from a weapon being stretched in my direction
Cause You closer
Than I notice even when you're at a distance
Your love and disposition counteracting my resistance

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lee Green]
Events millenniums ago will have to bless me now
If I could lasso clouds and pull to bring me heaven down
Or sprout wings through space suits of spirit essence gowns
His blood would be the tsunami that made my efforts drown
And prove to be the only means by which I'm heaven bound
His innocence in my defense is how I am aloud
Of him to shroud me by His presence in which sinners bow
Not after heaven, but my Jesus deep within the crowd
Seated in places far beyond the flesh's here and now
But yet we wait to leave in bodies that ascend from ground
Maybe that's why my cup runs over but I'm still thirsty
Satisfied but I'm drinking e'ry day, early
A close distance, not arrived, late, still early
Clean, real dirty Vile, but I feel worthy
My flesh a burden and a veil
But I can see clearly
By the spirit Jesus is in Heaven
Yet He's still near me

[Hook]
