[Hook: Fred Council]
My homeboys say they stuck in they ways
And they can’t see that changing no time soon
Tuck the heat and start puffing away
Aware of the danger but they don’t see it like I do
They don’t see it like I do, they don’t see it like I do
No, no, no, no, no, they don’t see it like I do
They don’t see it like I do, like I do

[Verse 1: The Voice]
Cholos, vatos, locos comprende, gangbanging, set-tripping, flag-waving esses
Cripped out, pimped out, bloods and crips, rocking feather cuts, old school like DJ Quick
Yeah real talk though y’all should co-exist, that’s what got both of them colours on both y’all wrists
But yeah they don’t see it like ya boy and Eshon, they give me two fingers up, three tucked, peace sign
I touch down in Romania, Bucharest, Chi lava, I preach to them prisoners it couldn’t get liver
Pimps, thugs and murderers, all European, third-world conditions were all you were seeing
No matter where you’re staying we are all human beings, I told them stand up like a man where I can see them
50 brothers jumped up in a flash, screaming out I believe why them hecklers laugh

[Hook: Fred Council]
My homeboys say they stuck in they ways
And they can’t see that changing no time soon
Tuck the heat and start puffing away
Aware of the danger but they don’t see it like I do
They don’t see it like I do, they don’t see it like I do
No, no, no, no, no, they don’t see it like I do
They don’t see it like I do, like I do

[Verse 2: Lavoisier]
My homeboys they thugging a bunch of felons, we preaching but it’s like nothing that you can tell ‘em
Pass the canon reaching where they mothers feel like they failed them, the code of the street life stuck all in their cerebellum (cerebellum)
If we don’t get them the paramedics gone pick ‘em up, prepubescent era when some of us picked the pistol up
Go to jail and nobody there to come visit us, hate racism but how do we never get it out
Then we glorify the nonsense blatantly, look inside the youngens eyes I can see the vacancy, (vacancy)
Got a soul but Satan is in control,  the hatred’s making ‘em old, the weight is taking its toll
Money can never pay for sin, yeah cost a grip, price tag heavy so don’t bother saving all your chips
Got the nerve to ask what’s bothering me, so rather take the jail cell over a college degree, they can’t see it

[Hook: Fred Council]
My homeboys say they stuck in they ways
And they can’t see that changing no time soon
Tuck the heat and start puffing away
Aware of the danger but they don’t see it like I do
They don’t see it like I do, they don’t see it like I do
No, no, no, no, no, they don’t see it like I do
They don’t see it like I do, like I do

[Verse 3: Eshon Burgundy]
Ever been on the corner with your homeboys, in front of the Chinese store next to that phone boy
Blowing on strong, hand palming that chrome toy, so if he feels threatened he draws concealed weapon
Did he ever explain to you why he sell work? Have you ever thought about his point of view for doing dirt huh?
Right now I wanna have that conversation and see the crack through the eyes of the Reagan administration
Cause facts and lies only lie in separate places, and cancel out each other when one of them is discovered by the other
So when they tell you that they do it for the babies, yet they never see the babes man is absolutely crazy
Passion fruit Mercedes, two pair of [?] like the 80’s, flashy suit, two matching ladies, he getting gravy
Swear he know GOD cause he’s no longer broke, hate to see the look in his eyes when he dies and don’t float, woah!

[Hook: Fred Council]
My homeboys say they stuck in they ways
And they can’t see that changing no time soon
Tuck the heat and start puffing away
Aware of the danger but they don’t see it like I do
They don’t see it like I do, they don’t see it like I do
No, no, no, no, no, they don’t see it like I do
They don’t see it like I do, like I do

[Verse 4: Eric Christopher]
Chilling on the sides, you’re a king, lies what they bring
Hearts cold, blacker than nights they eyes full of sin, it’s so grim
Hearts get snatched from out their flesh here, fisher of men, patching souls in my net clear?
It’s no fear, lights beaming through these last days
I’m broadcasting live, clash where that sin stay
It’s CHRIST first while ya scurry through that rat race
I don’t even play around you snakes get the gas face
They tell me dawg you on that sour path, I tell them look around you headed for that wrong wrath
But y’all don’t hear me though, tell em get they minds right, saying I’m a killjoy, you sick ill boy
But I got that medic-aid, I take the vein like an IV, we die D call it daily
Off that peace talk they like eff you pay me
I call that weak talk homey bless you praise HE

[Hook: Fred Council]
My homeboys say they stuck in they ways
And they can’t see that changing no time soon
Tuck the heat and start puffing away
Aware of the danger but they don’t see it like I do
They don’t see it like I do, they don’t see it like I do
No, no, no, no, no, they don’t see it like I do
They don’t see it like I do, like I do
