[Verse 1: Eshon Burgundy]
Heart of a King, blood of a slave
When it's all said and done we'll walk out of the grave
Abraham, Abraham he got seeds to raise
I pray a man will stay a man in the eviliest days
Please Lord pardon out my mischievous ways
You share that drama with my mama I'll be a disgrace
But I'm forgiven like the engine in a Honda I'm driven
Replace my period in my sentence with a comma I'm living
I'm feeling good, no stress in the hood with no vest
Shutting down Babylon I'm part of the protest
I was a vagabond living lit like marajuan
Flight academy membership high as a carry-on
My cord ain't know what the board been through
My scars are the proof I ain't got no war against you
I'm mud, I'm a slumboard do let me remind ya'll you know who got the glory I'm around to tell the story
Prince of peace, Prince of a King
I guess that means that it's all encompassing
The trinity wasn't mentioned it was obviously hidden
Something meant to be discovered, why didn't it?
Now while I'm in it let me just take a moment to mention He holy
He deserve the crown in the face of your rollie
I'll tell what these rappers never told you disciple class got a lot of spare vacant lil' homie straight up

[Hook]
Time is a running man (2x)
Tell time, take me to the motherland (time) (2x)
Tell time, the mans' watch cost a hundred bands (2x)
Can't tell time, cop caught him with a hundred grams (2x)
Now he doing time
There's a time for everything  (8x)

[Verse 2: Eshon Burgundy]
If the money dirty, how we get it clean?
If the rich filthy then the poor must be pristine
Blessed are the poor in spirit the Kingdom is theirs
The only reason we even here is to be prepared
I swear there's a difference in the mission when you live
Even though you quoted that don't mean you mean it when you say it
Blazing gunfire the bullets grazing your head
Even Peter folded under the circumstances ya dig
Out of the lineage of David the Savior
It's so much more you only seen the tip of the glacier
Gotta hold on like the belt clip on a pager
Goin straight in like the felt tip on a razor
King of Kings supreme ruler of all nations
Underground singing Hallelujah in the basement
I carry myself like a shooter and a statesmen
I'm spiritual no political affiliation
I'm a miracle that's in the making
Wasn't supposed to make it out of Public Housing
Deep in that living water drowning
Hustlers, I hung with hustlers I was a fountain
Praying for my man when we thought he bodied somebody
We dumped the gun skating in the car on the run
I was the first to follow Christ out of all my homies
Went from throwing dice to throwing rice Holy matrimony

[Hook]
Time is a running man (2x)
Tell time, take me to the motherland (time) (2x)
Tell time, the mans' watch cost a hundred bands (2x)
Can't tell time, cop caught him with a hundred grams (2x)
Now he doing time
There's a time for everything  (8x)
