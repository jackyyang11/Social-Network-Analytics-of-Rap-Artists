[Verse 1: Eshon Burgundy]
Has this generation raise the hell it said it would?
So much that we witness heaven and cannot tell it's good?
Dug a hole for the weak reverends that fell into it
Questions we avoid
But each second'll bring us closer to it
Cause if we recognize
Then we have to acknowledge
And if we testify, we gone have to do it honest
The commission is greater than us
And this religious system that's been enabling us
To stay quiet
Reserved
Undisturbed
Stalled
Got our cars on pause by the curb
Feelin like my life
Still belong to myself I know how I feel
But can't deny how I felt
The heart beat in my chest echo the Lord's drum
The same war drum that soldiers go to war from
Some of us might hit that frontline a hundred times
Look a dead man in his eyes and yell come alive
Come alive  Rise from night to day
Abandon ya chains snatch ya wings and fly away
This good news is gorgeous and fruitful
The death of the flawless (Jesus)
Makes the awful (man) useful
Tether the Lion of Zion but I am proof
Restricting Him to a cross resulted in Him being loosed
And His Spirit been imparted to the troops
None of us ain't get it just to talk it in the booth
Live it
People should know me and the Spirit are in cahoots
How ya know a tree you can't identify the fruit?
Gotta let it pour until I'm empty
Cause if I hold it in me I’ma jeopardize the youth
My lil brother in prison I'm tyna give'em Christ
At the same time explain why I ain't been in his life
But regardless of my failures and my shortcomings
What I can't do is not tell'em that the Lord want him

[Hook: J.R.]
And you’ll come alive
When you say goodbye
You’ll find rest
For Your soul
The moment you lose it
Oh, that’s when you’ll find it
And you’ll come alive
To this marvelous life
You’ll find rest
For Your soul
The moment you see it
I pray you believe it
And you’ll come alive

[Verse 2: JGivens]
There was a sower of seeds that knew
That seeds hit the ground
Grow into trees and they bear fruit
The soil he was throwin em to
Was me and you
What soiled your heart was all of them arteries on blue
And them RIPs
Following all them C's We viewed
But maybe for me  He sovereignly figured it was
Probably bigger than swallowing liquor and
Hollowin them strawberry swishers
And gettin lifted I hope you know
I know what it's like to be drug addicted
My dude My father spoke the Gospel to us
In the same room
And truth be told he was even closer to you
In distance geographically
Dad imprinted like graphic tees
The truth: The fiery dart proof Steeze
To Light up a dark room
Please, E
Big cousin I know you stated yo claim fam
And I'm not judgin
It's love and I hope that you be a changed man
Same clan
Same youth camp
Same pearls like the same two clams
Same two girls
With the same two plans
With them cuzzos came through to blam
Maybe you just gotta get tired of bein sick and tired
Or maybe gotta hear that He died for you one more time
To come alive

[Hook]

Come Alive
Come Alive
Come Alive

[Hidden Verse: Tandeace]
I had my son when we wasn’t on them speakin terms
You and me could neva hash it out
Like we need legal firms
But even if you sued you for the time you wasn’t present
You’d defend a lie and charm the jury like a present
I opened up that box before and wasn’t nuthin' there
That’s how I learned you never trust nobody with ya ears
So in my eyes you was dead and that ain't a lie
That’s my word to a witness on that alibi
Now you done come alive?
Askin for forgiveness?
What I'mma do with that?
Where they do that at?
Wish I could dead this issue I’m talkin
Source I’m speedin fast to miss you I’m talkin Porsche
It’s like I love you but you bad for me
You make it hard for me to trust you and that’s bad for me
But if I don’t forgive you tell me is it blasphemy?
Since I need that same forgiveness like a habit be?
I stay forgettin that you give me grace until I need it
If I don’t give it I don’t get it
Now you know I see it
So I’m accountable for what I know by what I do
That’s not dependent on whether or not he knows it too
And that’s what scares me
Cause you can suffer long I ain't that good
You straight laid down your life
Not sure I could I should be more like you
I know I should I guess that’s what this is
I’m on to You I get it It’s all for You to do through me
I’m powerless
A cynic
But if I let you come alive in me
Then you can get it
That glory that belongs to You
It’s all for You
What would I ever do if not for You?
I rocks for You
But You the Rock
You are the thing about me everybody thinks
I’m not I’m just the face they see
But You should get the credit
I don’t gamble but it’s safe to say
I’m safe in You Ill bet it
Father if You go through me
To get my father than I’m wit it
