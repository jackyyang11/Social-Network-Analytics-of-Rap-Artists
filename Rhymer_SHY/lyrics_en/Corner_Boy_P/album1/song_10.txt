[Verse 1]
Business minded since a young'un
Dope pumper, never no store runner
Treat the child like a fortune 500 compass
Try and come for me
Even when I was mad
Or at least planned to, know how the game to
Always focused on seeing it in piles
First words were money first thought were bleed
The same peewee from at the shop
Washing cars
Shit even then I was running shop
Tryna reach the top
Dope bars with cars and fast girl
Get the bag, whatever bag she wanted
Two cubans on some biggy shit
50 niggas on some 2Pac shit
Hit em up

[Hook]
I'm so gifted with the hustle
Drug money and bands piled to
Then turn the hustle to a business
Simple minded, you won't get it

I'm too gifted with the hustle
Drug money and bands piled to
Then turn the hustle to a business
Simple minded, you won't get it

[Verse 2]
A lot of hustlers I surpassed
And use their minds when hand first crashed
Hood nigga way too advanced
Fifth grade I bagged fruit and served the class
By middle school it was hand to hand
And I was clutched like miller, I had them leisure bags
I went to school to get revenue
Hoppin' off the bus went [?]
Fly shit, as my nigga Jewels
We been them niggas since back then
And I been sippin' since back then
First day of school can't push the benz
Get out a bitch then get out a friend
I'm a dog, me and this pit twins
Only loving these damn presidents
Don't go well [?] we like best friends

[Hook]
I'm so gifted with the hustle
Drug money and bands piled to [?]
Then turn the hustle to a business
Simple minded, you won't get it

I'm too gifted with the hustle
Drug money and bands piled to [?]
Then turn the hustle to a business
Simple minded, you won't get it

I'm too gifted with the hustle
Drug money and bands piled to [?]
Then turn the hustle to a business
Simple minded, you won't get it

I'm too gifted with the hustle
Drug money and bands piled to [?]
Then turn the hustle to a business
Simple minded, you won't get it
