[Verse 1: Corner Boy P]
Runnin' outta patience
Fuck waitin', like whats up with these labels
And it ain’t like a nigga ain’t workin'
And a nigga ain’t rich, but we ain’t hurtin'
And they ain’t sayin' all the shit that I’m hearin' [?]
And they ain’t sayin' that I’m the hottest nigga in the streets
But a nigga give the lame, watch I take it all
And my life ain’t no mothafuckin' glamour store
I be in the studio goin' hard with it
Talkin' bar after bar after bar spittin'
I dropped Fendi P 2, I shoulda took off
Shit, I went right back to the drawing boards
Rubbin' Jet Life shit on the world tours
And there will never be a Money Neva Sleep 4
[?] and they was still sleep
Knew I was on to something when I dropped Don P
Real niggas feel me

[Interlude: Corner Boy P]
Nigga was droppin' them bitches back to back
Every tape, straight hot shit
When I dropped that Fendi P 2 tho, I thought that was the one
Put a nigga where a nigga needed to be
Shit… back to the drawing boards, more work to do
Then American Greed came

[Verse 2: Corner Boy P]
Man Purp Dogg back on anotha one
Burned through an old, rolled up anotha one
He hit me up like: ‘'P it’s time for anotha one’‘
Shit, I was in the trap, tryna run it off
When they did [?] Money Neva Sleep 3
Cash Fargo had me sippin’ up the Sixteen
I was all up in the trenches for them drug sales
But my homie Cisco hit me by my Clientele
And if you ain’t seein' what I was doin', you ain’t get the picture
Put the camera all on my jewelry, gotta focus nigga
Every feature I be on, I be snappin' nigga
Every Weed & Instrumentals, I was snappin' nigga
Tryna get it nigga

[Outro: Corner Boy P]
Tryna get it
Every feature… every Weed & Instrumentals… every tape… back to back… straight high shit
Jet Life… to the next
And after that… it’s still
Corner Boy
