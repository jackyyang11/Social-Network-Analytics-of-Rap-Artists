Did you ever see the faces of the children?
They get so excited
Waking up on Christmas morning
Hours before the winter sun's ignited
They believe in dreams and all they mean
Including heaven's generosity
Peeping 'round the door
To see what boxes are for free
In curiosity

But Tommy doesn't know what day it is
He doesn't know who Jesus or what praying is
How can he be saved
From the eternal grave?

Surrounded by his friends, he sits so silently
And unaware of everything
Playing poxy pin ball
Picks his nose and smiles and
Pokes his tongue at everything
I believe in love
But how can men who've never seen
Light be enlightened?
Only if he's cured
Will his spirit's future level ever heighten

Tommy doesn't know what day it is
He doesn't know who Jesus or what praying is
How can he be saved
From the eternal grave?
