Cheer up, Charlie
Give me a smile
What happened to the smile I used to know
Don't you know your grin has always
Been my sunshine;
Let that sunshine show...

Come on, Charlie
There's no need to frown
Deep down you know tomorrow is your toy...

When the days get heavy
Never pit-a-pat 'em
Up and at'em boy

Some day, sweet as a song
Charlie's lucky day will come along
Till that day
You've got to stand strong Charlie
Up on top is right where you belong

Look up, Charlie
You'll see a star
Just follow it and keep your dreams in view
Pretty soon the skies are going to clear up
Charlie
Cheer up Charlie, do
Just be glad you're you
