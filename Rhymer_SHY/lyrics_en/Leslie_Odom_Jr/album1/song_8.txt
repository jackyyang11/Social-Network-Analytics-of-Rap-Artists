The First Noel the angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds
In fields as they lay;
In fields as they lay, keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

They all looked up and saw the star
Shining in the east beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and by night

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel
Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel
