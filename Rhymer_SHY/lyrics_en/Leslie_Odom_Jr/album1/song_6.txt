Bells be ringing the sad, sad news
Oh, what a Christmas to have the blues
My baby's gone, I have no friends
To wish me greetings once again

Choirs will be singing "Silent Night"
Christmas carol by candlelight
Please come home for Christmas
Please come home for Christmas, yeah
If not by Christmas, then New Year's night

Friends and relations send salutation
Sure as the stars shine above
But this is Christmas, Christmas, my dear
It's the time of year to be with the one you love

So don't you tell me that you'll never more roam
Christmas and New Year, they'll find you home
There'll be no sorrow, no grief and no pain
And I'll be happy once again

Friends and relations send salutation
Sure as the stars shine above
But this is Christmas, Christmas, my dear
It's the time to be with the one you love
So don't you tell me that you'll never more roam
Christmas and New Year, they'll find you home
There'll be no sorrow, no grief and no pain
And I'll be happy once again

I'll be so happy when I see you coming up the road
I'll be so happy when I hear you, when I get the call
I'll be so happy, 'cause you kept the love
And I'll be happy, happy
And you're the one I love
I'll be so happy, darling, once again
