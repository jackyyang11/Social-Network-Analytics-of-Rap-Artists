[Verse 1]
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on our troubles will be out of sight

[Verse 2]
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on our troubles will be miles away

[Verse 3]
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more

[Verse 4]
Through the years
We all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

[Verse 3]
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more

[Verse 4]
Through the years
We all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Have yourself a merry little Christmas night
