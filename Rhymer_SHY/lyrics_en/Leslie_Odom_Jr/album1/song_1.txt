The falling leaves drift by my window
Falling leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
Sunburned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all, my darling
When Autumn leaves start to fall

The falling leaves drift by my window
Falling leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
Sunburned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all, my darling
When Autumn leaves start to fall

Miss you most of all, my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

Come back baby
Oh, darling
My daring

Starts to fall
