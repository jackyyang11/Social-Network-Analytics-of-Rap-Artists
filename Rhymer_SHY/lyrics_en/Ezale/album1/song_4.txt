[Hook]
Damn, can't lie
The pill just hit I can't drive
Got damn I'm too high (high)
And the syrup, and the drink
Got a mix and I'm tryna sleep late
Got damn, too high (high.. high, high, high, high)
Got damn, too high, got, got damn, too high
Got damn, too high, got damn, too high (4x)
Got damn, too high

[Verse 1]
If I get it sealed up, I don't even trip
But if I get it in a Gerber I won't even drip
Pill by the boat, molly by the brick
And we all wanna try just to see if it hit
You want a 8oz or boat? A 8 ball of coke?
Or that 3.5 of that Moon Rock High?
So high can't stay still, ha!
I forgot how the pain feel
How many pills have you popped in a day?
How many pills have you popped in a day?
Not more than Mac Dre, you a damn lie
Oh that's it feel when your brain fried?
Man I'm on, yeah I'm hella on
And everybody so high they can't take me home
And when the bottle gone, then I'm leanin'
But I still woke up with my nose bleeding

[Hook]
Damn, can't lie
The pill just hit I can't drive
Got damn I'm too high (high)
And the syrup, and the drink
Got a mix and I'm tryna sleep late
Got damn, too high (high.. high, high, high, high)
Got damn, too high, got, got damn, too high
Got damn, too high, got damn, too high (4x)
Got damn, too high

[Verse 2]
Thirty dollar pill, get high for 3 days
Is you ready for that?
I'm on full throttle cause a pill and a bottle
And I'm tryna find a model that can swallow
You ever popped a pill, and said it didn't smack
So you smacked 4 mo' after that?
But then a hour later, you was rollin' out your mind
Cause all the pills hit at the same time, huh?
Coke mountains on a hot ass plate!
Coke mountains on a hot ass plate, bietch!
You tryna sleep while I'm stayin' awake
People sayin' that I'm losin' weight, on the real
Man I'm on, yeah I'm hella on
Ain't no money in my pocket and I lost my phone
My contacts all gone, they rely on me
And all the pills that I'm on, they prescribed to me

[Hook]
Damn, can't lie
The pill just hit I can't drive
Got damn I'm too high (high)
And the syrup, and the drink
Got a mix and I'm tryna sleep late
Got damn, too high (high.. high, high, high, high)
Got damn, too high, got, got damn, too high
Got damn, too high, got damn, too high (4x)
Got damn, too high

[Outro]
Pretty bitch bring all yo friends, pretty bitch bring all yo friends
Little bitch bring all yo friends, little bitch bring all yo friends (2x)
