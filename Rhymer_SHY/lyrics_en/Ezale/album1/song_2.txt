[Verse 1]
Man it's real life, tucked gun, tucked knife
Got blurped twice, and I made alright
I was out, I ain't going back, if you run my name, it's a wrap
I need to tuck my thing at your house, so check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out

Check it out hoe, let me tell you what I'm 'bout though
Entrance in the back but I went another route though
Hey, I gotta feed my household
Crazy how much money that I made off of ???

Yeah, I gotta cop and blow
Fuck 5-0, they can't stop the dough
They wanna lock your bro, for attempt to sell
But you found hella money, ain't find the scale

Ah ah ah ah, stay high-igh-igh-igh-igh
I'm a loud nigga, got a loud mouth, I get loud packs, I got a loud house
Getting down with the get-down, been around with the got-damn
Where was you, when they slid through? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?

[Chorus]
Foreal foreal
Let me tell you how I really feel
Foreal foreal
Man tell me what's real
Foreal foreal
Got killas in the field
Foreal foreal
Turn a rack to a mil, turn a rack to a mil

[Verse 2]
You said you got a nine, that jam all the time
And you try to let go for the low
But all it needed was a new clip, shit
Now that motherfucker, don't jam no more so

Got niggas that'll ride for me
I have book money take a dive for me
And if it come down to it off something I did
Throw the gun out the window while I'm riding on the ??? bridge

What I think about, all the same ass niggas I be rocking with
And all you niggas still been on that partner shit
You actin' like I ain't out here coppin' shit
That's why I'm always lit

[Verse 3]
Fuck the cannabis club, I'd rather buy from the streets
So all my niggas could eat
I can't knock the hustle if you trying to bubble
Just as long as you don't tell on me

When a pill in my body I don't feel drunk
And it can't be cut if it's sealed up
Hoes, hella funnies they looking for love
But she just tryna blow me out like 21 skunk

Uh huh, what you really wanna do
Got thangs but my niggas do too
Pop thangs but my niggas do too
No limit told me how to stay true

And I, bust moves 'cause I gotta make a living
Can't lose 'cause I play my position
Move a beat 'cause I live off commissions
It's Worldstar, all my niggas get digits

[Chorus]
Foreal foreal
Let me tell you how I really feel
Foreal foreal
Man tell me what's real
Foreal foreal
Got killas in the field
Foreal foreal
Turn a rack to a mil, turn a rack to a mil

[Verse 4]
RIP to my little brother
It'll never be another, it'll never be
RIP to my little brother
It'll never be another

Gotdamn little bro, man I miss you
Can't wait till I get here with you
Gotdamn little bro, man I miss you
One day, one day Imma see you
I guarantee
