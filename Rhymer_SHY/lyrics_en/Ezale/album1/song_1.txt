Uh huh, funky fresh on y'all                                                                                   Hitting licks breaking bricks (breaking bricks)
Ya, with my day one niggas (day one niggas)
In the streets how we trying to get rich (trying to get rich)
Ya, with my day one niggas (day one niggas)
And I'm chilling with my day ones
With my day one day one niggas
Ya, And I'm with my day ones (day ones)
With my day one niggas
Ya, And I'm rocking with my day ones
With my day one day one niggas
Cause you only live once
Hah, with my day one day one niggas

[Verse 1]
This one for the real ones
The ones I'mma split it with when I get millions
All my brothers done seen me in my broke day
Until I sold cocaine
Living life in the dope game
Yeah it only take a bullet that'll make you into no name
So instead of me holding a gun
I got my day one, who holding the drum
They wasn't with me shooting hoop in the gym
When we was on the block we was shooting at them
Both sides we don't play that shit
I put a few grams over if you weigh that shit
Police trying to lock as up
But a mark and a badge ain't stopping us
And if my brothers don't fuck with ya
Cause you a fuck nigga
You can't cop from us
Cause there's no hesitation when you slide with me
I ain't even gotta ask who gon ride with me
And my day one niggas they believed in me
When these grimy ass streets be deceiving me, yeah
My day ones I done rocked for ya
I done shot for ya
I was born in the mafia
