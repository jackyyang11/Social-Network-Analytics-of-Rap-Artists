[Verse 1]
Yo, look, I woke up with my attitude, Kanye
I don't give a fuck what my mom say
Okay, maybe a little bit, but only cause I'm really not tryna start up any beef with my madre
But in my mind, today I'm Beyoncé
I don't wanna hear whatever y'all say
I'm a beast, give me monster, no latte
Wearin' all black, like I'm robbin' you in broad day
I had one too many bad nights
Today I don't wanna hear no advice
So all of you little bitches, act nice
I don't wanna fuckin' have to ask twice
Bitch, any other day but not hoy
You can even hear the tone of my voice
Today my grind is pumped up on 'roids
Today my ego's gassed up, like Floyd

[Hook]
Look, I swear to God, the life I live, has got my mom, like, ay, ay, ay
All my bro's that's sellin' O's, that kush, that dro, that white
What you want? Them bars, Patron, that got you on that, ay, ay, ay
Tryna roll, you lose control, we on that level, don't try, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay

[Verse 2]
Yo, look, my mama kicked me out, cause I was partyin' like YOLO
Woke me up for church, I was hungover, she's like, "oh, no"
Gave my ass a bucket, trapeador, and got the Cloro
Pitbull jacked my mom, since I was a baby she yellin ‘Como!?’
She like: ¿Cómo que no? Ponte a trapear
Todo lo que compro te doy, ponte a limpiar
Pantalones rotos y ya ponte a lavar
Aquí no tienen voto, carnal, pónteme al par
Aquí no comen si no se acomiden
Si aquí no ayudan, aquí ya no viven
Si aquí no das, aquí ya no recibes
Y pónganse en linea, que esto ya no es chiste
Que a mi no me importa que Heather no ayuda
Muchacha huevona, allá su mamá
Por ahí la vi con el novio que tiene
De aqui a nueve meses que ya son papás
Pinche malandro nomas pa' robar
Es poquitero, rapero local
Y Claudia no quiero que siguas al mal
Y pobre de ti que si andas igual! (mom!)

Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
