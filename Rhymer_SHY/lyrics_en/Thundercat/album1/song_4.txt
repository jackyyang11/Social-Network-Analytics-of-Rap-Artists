[Verse 1]
Travel through the light
Holy, holy
Take me to the highest mountain
And the lowest seas
Glory of your light
Break through

[Verse 2]
I want to experience all the light has to offer me
Bathing in your glow
Patterns in the light
Pressing your frontiers
Totally reborn
Don't be afraid of death
We'll be gone in the twinkling of an eye

[Outro]
Eye, eye, eye
