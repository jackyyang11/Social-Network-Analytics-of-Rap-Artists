[Verse 1]
Early each morning he searched for her
'Til his feet became bloody and tired
Her hologram photo stayed near to him
Buried deep in the pits of his heart
The lock of grey hair that she gave to him
Stayed clutched in his fist through the night
Dead or alive, she still yearned for him
'Cause even in darkness there's light, oh and

[Chorus]
One by one
It's your time
Lead them both back to one
The sun has come
May your light lead them both back to one
Indivisible sum
Here's the book now the saga's begun
He wonders if she is the one
(You're the one)
She wonders if he is the one
(You're the one)

[Verse 2]
Cold in the cell, lost and shivering
Gunshots in hallways unknown
On the fifth floor, past the blue door
Sat a chained 57821
Sir Greendown told his dear Cindi
Fight like Achilles in Troy
"I will show you the ways that I love you
I saved you so you'd save the world
'Cause you're the only one"

[Chorus]
One by one
It's your time
Lead us all back to one
The sun has come
May your light lead us all back to one
Indivisible sum
Here's the book now the saga's begun
I wonder if I am the one
(You're the one)
I wonder if I am the one

(You're the one)

Anthony Greendown your Cindi Mayweather will always be waiting for you
(You're the one)
Just as sure as the sunlight keeps beaming on your eyes I shall always be waiting for you
(You're the one)
