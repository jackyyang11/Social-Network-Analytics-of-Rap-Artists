Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo-doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo-doo, doo, doo, doo

[Verse 1]
Every five minutes checking my phone
Sitting on the edge of my bed
Just to see if you called
See, I've been waiting all day (I've been waiting all day)
Lately I've been acting strange and things
Walking round like I'm in a train
Singing silly love songs
And that ain't me at all

[Pre-Chorus]
See I tried to brush it off as just a silly game
That young girls like to play
But as time moved on I knew
My heart only beats for you (for you)
See what I'm tryna say is

[Chorus]
You make me feel
The way I felt when I first met you
And my soul got chills (my soul, it got chills)
And you make me feel
Like I can't breathe without your love
And that's oh, so real

[Verse 2]
See, I never thought I'd find love
A girl like me, it was impossible
And now I find myself in love
Boy, you got my nose wide open
I can't believe that you would be the one
Who would end my childish games for good (games for good)

[Pre-Chorus]
See, I've tried to brush it off
As just a silly game that young girls like to play
But as time moved on I knew
My heart only beats for you (it only beats for you)
See what I'm trying to say is

[Chorus]
You make me feel
The way I felt when I first met you
And my soul got chills
And you make me feel
Like I can't breathe without your love
And that's oh, so real

[Bridge]
Ever since you walked in my life
Boy, I swear I ain't been the same, no
Ain't it funny how things do happen?
You came in and you re-arranged
My heart
And I'm so grateful, baby
I mean, I'm truly grateful, baby
You made a difference in my life
I can't explain the way that I feel
This journey through my mind
Cloud 9, oh-ho

And I tried to brush it off...
I tried and I tried and I tried...

Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo-doo, doo, doo, doo
See, I tried to brush you off...
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo-doo, doo, doo, doo

[Bridge]
Ever since you walked in my life
Boy, I swear I ain't been the same, no
(Said I want you, baby)
Ain't it funny how things do happen?
(And I need you, baby)
You came in and you re-arranged
(Oh, oh, oh) My heart (Yeah, said I want you, baby)
And I'm so grateful, baby
I mean, I'm truly grateful, baby
You made a difference in my life
And I can't explain the way that I feel
This journey through my mind
