As I seach for a home
And a place to belong
I find it hard to fit in

I meet lots of pretty girls
In this fantasy world
Waiting for their turn to shine

So I try to be Cindi
In hopes that they'd notice
But I wasn't their cup of tea

It's so lonely
When I'm only
Being me

Who's that girl in the mirror
With hair like a rockstar
She wants to dance but she has cold feet

Her confidence is low
So much talent but who'll know
When she's afraid to follow her dream

So I talked to her heart
And made up her mind
That I gotta accept her for me

But it's still lonely
When I'm only
Being me

Oooohhhhhhh
You gotta be you
And I've gotta be me

Only
Only be
Me
