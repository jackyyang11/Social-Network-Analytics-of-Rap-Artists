[Verse 1]
Take me, take my letters, take my photos, take the sun
You can take my heart
Cause I ain't gonna need it on the run
I've been trying to work it out
But my words fall right apart baby
I'll leave oh, don't you know
I can't deal with the hurt anymore
Oh baby don't leave

[Chorus]
Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love
No, I can't sleep
Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love
I can't eat (oh, no)
Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love
I can't breathe
Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love

[Verse 2]
Autumn, autumn's coming round
And summer's not the same
It's like winter without your smile
I spent some time just thinking to myself
I picked up one of your photos and I put it right back on the shelf

[Chorus]
I can't eat
Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love
I can't breathe
Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love
I can't eat (oh, no)
Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love
I can't breathe
Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love

[Bridge 1]
I can't be a day without your smile
You're the one for me but all the while
I just think that we should give all our love
Give love, love, love, love, love
I can't be a day without your smile
You're the one for me but all the while
I just think that we should give all our love
Give love, love, love, love

[Chorus]
Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love
No, I can't sleep
Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love
I can't eat
Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love
I can't sleep
Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love
Baby, baby, ooh

[Refrain]
Baby, baby
(I can't eat)
Baby, baby
(I cannot live)
Baby, baby
Baby, baby
(I cannot eat)
Baby, baby 
(Baby, baby)
I cannot
Baby, baby
(Baby don't you know?)
Baby, baby

[Bridge 2]
They say love is patient, love is kind
Love ain't never did a thing to mine
Love ain't weak, love is strong
Love be telling my heart don't go
They say love is patient, love is kind
Love ain't never did a thing to mine
Love ain't weak, greater than pride
I can't live without your love

[Bridge 1]
I can't be a day without your smile
You're the one for me but all the while
I just think that we should give all our love
Give love, love, love, love
I can't be a day without your smile
You're the one for me but all the while
I just think that we should give all our love
Give love, love, love, love
