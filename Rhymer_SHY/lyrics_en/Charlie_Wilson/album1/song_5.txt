Love
If your missing that someone you love
Let me see you do a step, do a step

I know that I apologized about a million times
I know your heard this all before
Ohh yeah
What can I say, that can make you change your mind
You see I'm not the man you used to know
Ohh yeah

I'm like a star out of place
My heart is an empty space
It's clearer to me now that your gone
Ohh yeah
I wish that I can undo the hurt I put you through
And now I'm so lost without you

I've got to get back to your love
Ohh yeah
Like a kid whose lost his way
I'm trapped inside a maze
Get back to your love
Ohh yeah
Can you point me in the right direction
To your love, your love, your love, love love love
Can you point me in the right direction
To your love, your love, your love, love love love
Can you point me in the right direction

For what its worth, as long as it takes
I will wait forever just to get to you
Ohh yeah
I hear your voice, I see your face
Only your touch would take away this pain
Ohh yeah
I lay awake coz I can't sleep dreaming on
How I realize that I'm imagining
Do I cross your mind, do you think of me
If I had the chance this time I'll follow your lead

I've got to get back to your love
Ohh yeah
Like a kid whose lost his way
I'm trapped inside a maze
Get back to your love
Ohh yeah
Can you point me in the right direction
To your love, your love, your love, love love love
Can you point me in the right direction
To your love, your love, your love, love love love
Can you point me to the right direction

When its said and done
