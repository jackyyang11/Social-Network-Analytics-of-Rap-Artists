[Intro]
God, you're amazing
Thank you for my life
For all of your blessings
And for watching over us

[Verse 1]
Mountains high, oceans wide
Sunmade days and story nights
Amazing you are
Birds up high, spread wings and fly
Just to thank you for the skies
Beautiful you are

[Pre-Chorus]
As a rainbow up its colors to you
We raise our hands of all colors too

[Chorus]
What an amazing god, you are
Let all the world choose to see
That you're an amazing god, yes you are
And the moment we look to you, we can see
What an amazing life to each of us, you bring

[Verse 2]
Spinning world, moving fast
City lights and angels pass
And still amazing you are
My story passed will not last
The hope, the dreams, the peace I had
Because more the less you are

[Pre-Chorus]
As a rainbow up its colors to you
We raise our hands of all colors too

[Chorus]
What an amazing god, you are
Let all the world choose to see
That you're an amazing god, yes you are
And the moment we look to you, we can see
What an amazing life to each of us, you bring

[Bridge]
You're an amazing god, you are
We the world, we choose to see
You're an amazing god, you are
And we look to you, and we see
The amazing life to all of us, you bring
Aaah oooh yes

Listen
I let go, all the negativity
And I float in your positive energy
I'm so grateful, yeah I'm so thankful
I'll sing it with me now
(I let go, all the negativity)
(And I float in your positive energy)
(I'm so grateful) greatful (yeah I'm so thankful)
I let go, all the negativity
And I float in your positive energy
I'm so grateful, greatful, yeah I'm so thankful, thankful

Can you sing it
Sing it one more time for me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm so grateful, grateful, grateful
I'm so thankful, thankful, thankful
I'm so grateful, hallelujah
I'm so grateful, hallelujah
Thank you
