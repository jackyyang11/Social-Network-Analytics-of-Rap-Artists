[Verse 1]
I don't wanna give you flowers again, it's something that is typical
Wanna give you a gift that you would never forget
This is special day so we gotta do something that's unusual
Go on out, don't hold up
Light up the sky, pyro

[Pre-Chorus]
Go head let your hair down
Another year that you made it
So let's take it to the dance floor

[Chorus]
Make you're request tonight's your night, oh yes
Show off them curves your birthday dress
Blow out the candle and I grant your wish
I'm lovin' you in that birthday dress
Birthday dress

[Verse 2]
Doesn't matter how's watching, it's your holiday so celebrate
Do whatever that you want to do, we won't let the seconds waste
Vast is in the air, let's make a toast, it's rainin' champagne
That girl, that girl is looking sweeter than birthday cake

[Pre-Chorus]
Go head let your hair down
Another year that you made it
So let's take it to the dance floor

[Chorus]
Make you're request tonight's your night, oh yes
Show off them curves your birthday dress
Blow out the candle and I grant your wish
I'm lovin' you in that birthday dress
Birthday dress

[Bridge]
Clap your hands and stomp your feet
'Cause it's your day, and it's you beat
Said it's your party, you can dance all you like
Clap your hands and stomp your feet
'Cause it's your day, and it's you beat
Said it's your party, you can dance all you like

[Pre-Chorus]
Go head let your hair down
Another year that you made it
So let's take it to the dance floor

[Chorus]
Make you're request tonight's your night, oh yes
Show off them curves your birthday dress
Blow out the candle and I grant your wish
I'm lovin' you in that birthday dress
Birthday dress
