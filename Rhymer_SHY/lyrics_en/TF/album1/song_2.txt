[Intro]
Ugh, uh, okay, okay

[Verse 1]
Yeah this mothafucka knock, EQ's lookin' like stocks
L seven solo barracks bass rock
Cavvy, whippin' base rock cavvy
Clientele in the alley more stripes than Cincinnati
Bangos, ran through more whips than Djangos
Imma jugg till my name known
Flame on till my gang on, green long as field goals
We bear arms we strong arm, stretch Armstrong
Strunt fat tees no long arms
Imma in the street no all-stars, I go raw like pornstars
Wolfgang like Mozart
We gassed up, we gas up then we go fart, cold heart
Cold hearted like David in the Departed, find a bitch on Section 8 and we turn her into the Carter
Yesterday I was broke, tommorow I push a Rari
Prolly not but nigga I'm getting guap
This mothafucka knock

[Skit]
If I don't make it to the NBA?
Then you be a drug dealer
Somehow I'm gon get me a Lexus (laughing)*

[Verse 2: WayDah]
Keep a hoodie on so you could never pull my coat
My guns knock knock, no who there jokes
We preyin' on niggas, and stayin' true to my religion
If Trump come for me, he gone finally meet the semi
My aggression has no relation with being friendly
The chances on niggas keepin' it G, gettin' skinny
I'm walkin' with the dead, runnin' lights when they red
I got money on my mind, prices on nigga's heads
Shit real
Nigga tryna get a mill
When a nigga broke a nigga do it for the thrill
Make a hit, take a hit
You signin' the same deal
I'm forever trigger happy with lyrics that's gon' kill
WayDah!
