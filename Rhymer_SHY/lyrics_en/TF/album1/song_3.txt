[Verse]
Uhh
Big face Franklins I never had shit
I spend 'em like they ain't nathin'
Fast money drop racks on laces
Fast money, pink slip races
I gotta stay fly I'm from the city of angels
And I stay in some beef, I should buy an apron
I'm married to the kill I don't fear, I don't fake
I'm every broad dream like a 5-tiered take
I'm every broad dream like a 5 carat ring
I'm every broad dream, to never gain weight
You bitches better wake up
Back to reality
'cause I'm a nightmare in actuality
Ask her, I got her for her salary
We chopped it up then I dipped like celery
And I'll be damned if a bitch get mad at me
And have me booked on a technicality
Uh, 'cause I'm living what I'm talking
What you know about house licks, early morning stalking?
What you know about Ziplocs? Glittery and chalky
I don't sniff it no more I mix it in my coffee
Pure cane sugar and hazelnut
I like to gamble with life and say it's luck
If you know me you know when I'm powered up
I got tattoos I can't like about, fuck
It's the truth believe me she's pullin' up
I feel it in the air I'm smelling it through the trunk
A couple pounds and some choppas in the golf bag
Come get some money with a madman, killer
