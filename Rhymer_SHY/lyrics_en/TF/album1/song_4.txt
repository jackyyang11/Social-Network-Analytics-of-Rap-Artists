Stain on your life Faneto
Body in the trunk like a kilo
Niggas claim they a Fuckin' Monsta
Imma show yall who on beast mode
Ill flame you up and let the heat blow
Leave a nigga stankin' like fritos
Then im gone off to puerto rico
Smokin cuban cigs countin C-notes

Fame and hoes you can keep those
I got questions you can answer tho
Like why the fuck your killers never killed
And where the fuck is the K you tote

My killers out lurkin'
They strapped up like purses
Them bullets come burnin'
You hurtin' for certain
And searchin' for surgeons
Fam gathered at churches
Your pictures on shirts
Cryin' preaches and hearces

You got me fucked up thought i wasn't returnin'
Fans got you in memory recitin' your verses
If you get scared and go to the church
And im moving in silence
My 9 gotta silence
I silence then sermon
Got shorties out with me
They probably out murderin'
Dressed up in all black hoppin' out the excursion
Fuck a ski mask im really purgin'

Claim you up next then im takin' your place
Remember back then you was rockin' them braids
Back in the day im talkin' 3rd grade
Now you the shit cuz you got you some fame
Fuck dissin' for fame
All of a sudden he throwin' up rakes
He lowkey informin' he rattin' to jakes
Them Gs find out they get rid of the flake
Get rid of the snake by blowin' the 8

Its really hard to call you a Monsta
Merch you got a K and a chopper
Put it on Rico you got a revolver
Gon' head lil nigga put it on your momma
Real niggas dont do that pillow talkin'
Got bitches thatll shoot like Tony Parker
In the ICU with shitbags and walkers
Shooters laid in your bushes like a crazy bitch stalkin'

Lyin' in your songs like you really shootin'
Do you really got a gun bitch nigga prove it
First time Chaise killed you now i hate to do it
This rap shit ain't you stick to hoopin'
Your bitch was on my dick now she a groupie
You ain't a damn killer who the fuck you foolin'
Never bust no shots what the fuck was you doin'
When it come down to me nigga ain't no losin'

Who the fuck is monsta?
A fake ass nigga
What Alan stand for?
A Lame Ass Nigga

Got kicked out the crib
Out of state ass nigga
Now he dissin off the shits
Cocaine ass nigga
Ran to meechie crib cryin
Feel my pain ass nigga
Apologize to the fans you fuckin' ass kisser
You can call this shit here a fuckin' ass kicker
How yall thought he was gonna kill me
He ain't never tote a pistol
Wanna send shots?
Come and catch a missle
Front page on the paper
Come and get your issue
Give this rap shit up
It could all be so simple
They gonna have this bumpin'
Like a motherfuckin pimple
Talkin' out your neck
Blow the motherfuckin whistle
You a standstill target everything gonna hit you
I killed this nigga farewell this a motherfuckin' tribute
My dick was in her mouth and you let the bitch kiss you

You said you was gonna bodybag me
Kill me, toetag me
Break me in half bodycast me
Take off and hopefully pass me
Imma go and load the Mac squeeze
Smile when you see that flash cheese
If your momma wanna beg and plead
Imma put 3 in that bitch spleen
Drop her down to her fuckin knees
Put it on camera make you watch the screen
Hollow tips long clips its a scary scene
Wanna play games this is saw 3
If im a fuckin' problem then solve me
Niggas still sweatin off that molly
Your fans hyped your head up like coffee
Im sick of niggas jumpin' out they body......

I came back around to catch this double Homi
