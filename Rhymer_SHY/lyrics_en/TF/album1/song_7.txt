[Intro]
Ugh, okay, okay, ugh

[Verse 1]
This that automatic kill shit
This that fuck a hook, this that real shit
And I'm tired of bitch niggas with these gang tats
How you 'posed to be a loc and got your chain snatched, ugh
But I won't say no names tho
This that million dollar chain flow
This that 20 round gauge flow
This that kill who you came for
And dead the rest too, cause they gon talk about it
Cuz niggas work they mouth more than orthodontists
This that heavy hitter with the stupid squabble
This that classic, Ray Allen, SuperSonics
This that super saiyan, and the hyperbolic
This that American Sniper with the camo rifle
Word to Nastradamus, I'm the streets disciple
I won't tell them nada, right hand on the Bible
This that Joe Jackson Jackson Five recital
We gon make it happen, I put that on my vitals
E'rybody snitchin', so I don't do alliance
Fifth with two clips, insurance by survival
This that homicidal drunk drivin' street tyrant
This gon' change the game, Remember the Titans
This that Bin Laden politicin' with Obama
After 9/11, villas in the Bahamas
Picture that with some binoculars
This that all night dope house, Lake Minnetonka
Belt Ferragamo, try me and Fanté
This that bar popping animal, gram sniffing monster
Monster of that double entendre
This that Hell's Kitchen entrée , we eat buttered lobsters
This that nigga keep your watch tucked
This that Mr. Chow's chopsticks, China white, not cut
This that early morning boxed up
This that single man cell livin', starving till his box touch
This that henny with the red guts
This that rémy till I'm dead drunk, straight lace [?] cut
This that killa gang face huh?
Buck fifty leave ya face fucked, bleedin' till the jakes come
This that pig skin laced up
That mean everybody catchin' bullets, double clip taped up
This that nigga get ya cake up
This that Training Day Mossberg, kill 'em and split the cake up
What, kill em

[Intermission]
Let it run
Ugh
Run it back
Okay, okay, ugh

[Verse 2]
Excuse the intermission slash dope break
This that double back after the yellow tape
This that old dude bangin' at the King parade
This that bucket of acid after they raid
No evidence, ain't nobody sayin' shit so all they got is he say she say, irrelevant
This that demon in the church, that's the reverend
I'm hell bound, but I'm heaven sent, ugh
Holy water's what I sip, so all these bloodsuckers watch em burn while i spit, ugh
This that fuck ya politics, this that unprofessional shit
Everybody get hit, kill em
