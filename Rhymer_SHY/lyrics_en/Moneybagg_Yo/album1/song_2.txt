[Intro: 2Pac]
We already gone
I don't understand, it's not the same rules
We all have to follow the same rules
The rules have to apply to every man, woman and child
It cannot be just for the rich or for the poor
If it is, there's gon' be war

[Verse 1]
I learned rule number two before rule number one (What's that?)
Life ain't sweet, it's a stale honey bun
Two ears, one mouth (Do what?)
Listen before you speak
Two brains north and east, so it take twice as long to think (Over your mind)
I'm used to ice my wrist, can freeze a skating rink (A hockey rink)
Don't ask the price, I dished it out just like the sink
I'm from the concrete, but I blossomed like a rose
Lookin' for the snakes in the grass, they probably by the hose (Right over there)
Let's celebrate with a meal (For what?)
Even if the only thing we celebratin' is that I can pick up the bill (That's real)
With no hesitation, it feels amazin'
I was depressed, poppin' pills (Pills)
But that’s long gone, couple years
My whole career I faced fears
It's divine, God placed me here
These days, these niggas get caught and lie to they ho (Then what?)
But you told the truth to the po-pos, man that ain't how this shit go (That's crazy)
I put my new bitch on payroll, and told her play her position (Let's do this)
I paid the plug in pesos, he bought his wife a new kitchen (Pablo)

[Chorus]
10, 20, 50, 100s I want all faces (All)
Tryna set the record straight before the law take me ('Fore the law)
I got rich, beat the trail, still got tribulations (Then what?)
I handle business on my terms, these my stipulations (They mine)
Shit been all crazy, crazy, all crazy (All crazy)
Shit been all crazy, crazy, all crazy (All crazy)
When I was fucked up, I had nobody to call, "Baby" (Call, "Baby")
Now I'm covered in these diamonds, you can Allstate me (Insure it)

[Verse 2]
Smokin' good and sippin' syrup keep my mind contained (Closed)
On the road, missin' home, but I hide that pain
Wanna spend time with your kids, it's more than buyin' 'em things
No matter how big I get, you know the grind remain
How you gon' judge, but don't know me?
You say you love me, bitch, show me
I leave her in the house lonely
She say she missin' the old me
I'm in my bag like the groceries
Broke out them whips like I'm Toby
Rumors about me and old girl
They say I bought her a Rollie (Ha)
Eyes open, watch closely
Haters might try to dope me (Yeah)
Get insight from the OGs
I'm presidential, bitch, vote me
Their defense ain't strong enough
They try their best just to hold me
I place myself back where I was
In the Wraith, ridin' slowly
I got too hard, they gettin' jap, he must get help to write his raps
I wish him well, deep inside I hope he tap (Damn, that's foul)
If you know me, then you know thats gotta be cap (All cap)
I used to be broke now I get to that money 'SAP (ASAP, ASAP, right now)

[Chorus]
10, 20, 50, 100s I want all faces (All)
Tryna set the record straight before the law take me ('Fore the law)
I got rich, beat the trail, still got tribulations (Then what?)
I handle business on my terms, these my stipulations (They mine)
Shit been all crazy, crazy, all crazy (All crazy)
Shit been all crazy, crazy, all crazy (All crazy)
When I was fucked up, I had nobody to call, "Baby" (Call, "Baby")
Now I'm covered in these diamonds, you can Allstate me (Insure it)

[Outro: 2Pac]
We ain't no good no more
You can listen to how we talk
You can see it
If they could put a little thing on my head so you could see what I see when I close my eyes, it would make you crazy
