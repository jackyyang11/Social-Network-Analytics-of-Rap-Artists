[Intro]
Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up
Yeah, haha
Don't you remember back then when you used to wear the big ass shirts and shit nigga?
The swag, fat ass, haha
Yeah, I remember

[Chorus]
I remember back then (back then what?)
They was laughin' (they was trippin')
Now I'm on the road, now I'm doin' shows
Pickin' up back ends (pickin' up cash)
Got creed on my Gucci (got creed on my shirt)
Water whip her coochie (water whip her pussy)
I told baby I'm gettin' cash money, she remind me of Tunechi (she remind me of Wayne)
This ain't a new boo, I was fuckin' her back then (what you was doin'?)
Fuckin' you and your best friend (you and your best friend)
Had an Audi and an Aston (skrrt skrrt)
'Fore the deal, got my ass in (been had my ass in)
I was makin' transactions (I was makin' moves)
I ain't really into acting (I ain't really with that fool)
I was really into action (bop, bop, hey)

[Verse 1]
I remember back then I had to pop out, now I got a permanent grill (look at my shit)
My shit white gold, light show, light show, your shit stainless steel
Back then I was starvin' (look at me now)
But it got greater later (man it got really good)
Now my meals get catered (what type of food?)
Crab, steak, and potaters (tip the chef and the waiter)
Every thread on me tailored (Armani and Versace)
Water on me, I'm a sailor (in the middle of the ocean)
Smoked out, no vapor (big smoke, big smoke)
Black whips, Darth Vader (mix the RV and the Wraith)
I met her in Gucci, she had good coochie, I put her in Pucci (put her in designer)
I flew her to Houston and dumped her in Houston
She looked it so stupid, I'm nothin' like Cupid, ayy

[Chorus]
I remember back then (back then what?)
They was laughin' (they was trippin')
Now I'm on the road, now I'm doin' shows
Pickin' up back ends (pickin' up cash)
Got creed on my Gucci (got creed on my shirt)
Water whip her coochie (water whip her pussy)
I told baby I'm gettin' cash money, she remind me of Tunechi (she remind me of Wayne)
This ain't a new boo, I was fuckin' her back then (what you was doin'?)
Fuckin' you and your best friend (you and your best friend)
Had an Audi and an Aston (skrrt skrrt)
'Fore the deal, got my ass in (been had my ass in)
I was makin' transactions (I was makin' moves)
I ain't really into acting (I ain't really with that fool)
I was really into action (bop, bop, hey)

[Verse 2]
Fire up the Backwood, it smell like a skunk dead
I been gettin' to it, a hundred thou trap cash, pockets lookin' like bunk beds
I'm feelin' like Nipsey, I'm with a Lauryn London yeah, ooh she got dumb head (ooh)
I get the bitch tipsy, when she watch she be trippin', I fuck the shit out her like my bad (my bad)
My fault (my fault, hold up, hold up)
Sixty thou' what the wrist cost (AP, the Audemar)
Walked up on her, I was drippin' sauce
Bumped into her, now your bitch lost
I remember back then swag (what?)
White tee and some forces (it was back then)
I was havin' dreams 'bout Porsches (that was back then)
Now the label talkin' 'bout endorsements (right now)

[Chorus]
I remember back then (back then what?)
They was laughin' (they was trippin')
Now I'm on the road, now I'm doin' shows
Pickin' up back ends (pickin' up cash)
Got creed on my Gucci (got creed on my shirt)
Water whip her coochie (water whip her pussy)
I told baby I'm gettin' cash money, she remind me of Tunechi (she remind me of Wayne)
This ain't a new boo, I was fuckin' her back then (what you was doin'?)
Fuckin' you and your best friend (you and your best friend)
Had an Audi and an Aston (skrrt skrrt)
'Fore the deal, got my ass in (been had my ass in)
I was makin' transactions (I was makin' moves)
I ain't really into acting (I ain't really with that fool)
I was really into action (bop, bop, hey)
