[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah

[Chorus]
They say they need answers ('bout what?)
Well I got big facts (big facts, big facts)
You went about it the wrong way so we can't fix that (I'm so straight)
She mad at you so she come fuck me for get back (ugh ugh)
Next time you bring me up just make sure you state big facts (tell the truth)
Big facts, big facts (big facts, big facts)
Big facts, big facts (big facts, big facts)
Tryna shatter me with lies, I ain't with that (ayy tell the truth)
Big facts, big facts (big facts, big facts)
Big facts, big facts (real big facts)
Why they mad, 'cause I'm on fire and they ain't lit yet (what's that, what's that)
And that's big facts

[Verse 1]
Big facts, big racks (big facts, big facts)
Back end, big sack (got a big big bag)
FN, big gat (get back, splash)
I'm on that strong (what's that, what's that?)
Muscle six pack, (ugh, strong)
They want my spot and don't deserve it, can't forget that
Who you hittin' at? how you miss that?
I was the freshest nigga in the party
Louis V'ed down, shades by Bulgari
Ho out of body, gone off Bacardi
See you and I'm speakin', I'm comin' like I'm Cardi
I'll expose you niggas and bitches, I'm back in that mode of things
You niggas is gettin' too big for your britches, you need some new clothes and things (hah)
Why everybody act bunny at Bagg, that's the topic nigga
AP on my cost a bag, water faucet nigga
Never ever did some sucker shit like paid to take a nigga off a show (never)
She a green light, she a go
Mack on her, fuck and duck the ho

[Chorus]
They say they need answers ('bout what?)
Well I got big facts (big facts, big facts)
You went about it the wrong way so we can't fix that (I'm so straight)
She mad at you so she come fuck me for get back (ugh ugh)
Next time you bring me up just make sure you state big facts (tell the truth)
Big facts, big facts (big facts, big facts)
Big facts, big facts (big facts, big facts)
Tryna shatter me with lies, I ain't with that (ayy tell the truth)
Big facts, big facts (big facts, big facts)
Big facts, big facts (real big facts)
Why they mad, 'cause I'm on fire and they ain't lit yet (what's that, what's that)
And that's big facts (big ones)

[Verse 2]
Here go some more altercations, here goes some more speculation (here it go)
I took the money, went bought me some guns to light this bitch up like it's Vegas (urrr)
Keyboard killer, tough on Twitter
Makin' posts, givin' statements (Twitter)
Niggas full of games, Playstation
Can't kill me, I'm a Jason (woo)
Yeah I go fed, Mason (federal)
Locked like dreads, Haitian (Haitian)
You want my place, take it (take it)
Get hit with the drum, cadence (urrr)
You ain't my partner nigga
Only hang around nothin' but solid niggas (that's gang)
Say they want smoke but when you see 'em they non-toxic niggas (hah)
Ain't no pimp but get your ho, 'fore I knock her nigga ('fore I knock her nigga)
These little hitters wanna shoot them a movie, album, drop a nigga
Draco draco hit him, he go splat (splat)
Turn him into play-dough, lay him flat (flat)
Drippin' in the Audi with the hatch (skrrt)
Ridin' with it on me, never lack

[Chorus]
They say they need answers ('bout what?)
Well I got big facts (big facts, big facts)
You went about it the wrong way so we can't fix that (I'm so straight)
She mad at you so she come fuck me for get back (ugh ugh)
Next time you bring me up just make sure you state big facts (tell the truth)
Big facts, big facts (big facts, big facts)
Big facts, big facts (big facts, big facts)
Tryna shatter me with lies, I ain't with that (ayy tell the truth)
Big facts, big facts (big facts, big facts)
Big facts, big facts (real big facts)
Why they mad, 'cause I'm on fire and they ain't lit yet (what's that, what's that)
And that's big facts (big ones)
