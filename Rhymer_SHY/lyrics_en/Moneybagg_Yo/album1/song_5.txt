[Chorus]
I'm fresh off the plane, just got back from Cali
Hoes say we the best just like DJ Khaled
It's karats in my watch, I'm like fuck a salad
I put karats on my bitch, and wasn't fucked up 'bout it
One thing about it, I'm never fucked up 'bout it, hey
One thing about it, I'm never fucked up 'bout it, hey
One thing about it, I'm never fucked up 'bout it, hey
One thing about it, I'm never fucked up 'bout it, hey

[Verse 1]
My niggas ridin' for life, they like pegs on bikes
If my shoes can talk they'll say Christian Lou's with the spikes
Flooded out my Jesus piece just 'cause I believe in Christ
Don't fuck with you niggas like dykes
Shooting movies back to back like Spike
Got a call from LA, Akon said they tryna fly me there
Arrived at LAX, 8:40 AM, fresh out the air
You niggas worser than these bitch
Man stay out your feelings
Even though I'm like 6'3" I just sold a bale of midget
Bought her a pair of Giuseppes
Shawty turned out to be messy, I wasn't fucked up about it
Still burnt the head, after I get through it then just like the car she be outty
Your jewelry be cloudy, I fucked up a check on my shit, no doubty
No limit with money, I'm Master P with it, I'm 'bout it

[Chorus]
I'm fresh off the plane, just got back from Cali
Hoes say we the best just like DJ Khaled
It's karats in my watch, I'm like fuck a salad
I put karats on my bitch, and wasn't fucked up 'bout it
One thing about it, I'm never fucked up 'bout it, hey
One thing about it, I'm never fucked up 'bout it, hey
One thing about it, I'm never fucked up 'bout it, hey
One thing about it, I'm never fucked up 'bout it, hey

[Verse 2]
I'm in LA like I'm Kobe
If you don't know me don't approach me
I'm on that fuck shit like Sosa
I send them goons and it's over
I'm in the white and red Rover
That bitch look like a peppermint
Told that bitch hop in
She want to like like she celibate
What you mean, I ain't never heard
Where I'm goin', where they said I couldn't go
Turned the knob up just a lil more now
That my time, word from the Rollie watch
I'm sippin' that Activis raw
She like hold up, hold up, don't kill yourself
I reply worry 'bout your own health
'Cause bitch I'ma die by my damn self
I'm sippin' this shit 'til it's nothin' left
I got them bitches like Hugh Hefner
I'm slammin' P's like Shawn Kemp
Swimming in money like Michael Phelps
Your bitch wanna marry a king like Coretta
While you tryna impress her
Made two plays and went bought me a Rollie with bezels
Could've copped me a Tesla for real, hey, hey

[Chorus]
I'm fresh off the plane, just got back from Cali
Hoes say we the best just like DJ Khaled
It's karats in my watch, I'm like fuck a salad
I put karats on my bitch, and wasn't fucked up 'bout it
One thing about it, I'm never fucked up 'bout it, hey
One thing about it, I'm never fucked up 'bout it, hey
One thing about it, I'm never fucked up 'bout it, hey
One thing about it, I'm never fucked up 'bout it, hey
