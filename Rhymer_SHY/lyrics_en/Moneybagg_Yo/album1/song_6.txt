[Hook: Moneybag Yo]
Back and fourth, back and fourth
Back and fourth, back and fourth, back and fourth
I'm so sick of going
One minute I love you, next minute I hate you
One minute I need you, next minute, want to replace you
Back and fourth
Back and fourth

[Verse 1: Moneybag Yo]
We fuss and we fight, we fight and we fuss
You get mad at me, I'm like, get your stuff
I'm sick of that wining
That shit done got tiring
I would complain about other bitches, gotta get rid of you like a virous
Lil mama got me saying fuck her friends
It's hard for me to see the kids
When I call, she hit ignore
Man, I sware the bitch gonna make me week
We back on good terms, she like, you know where home is
Then I try to ask for som head, she like, na, I don't know where that dick been
Then I'm like, fuck that, you need to quit playin
Then she like, fuck you, you can't get mad
Then I'm like, cool, Imma fuck a new bitch then
Then she like, so, who that dick game been in
Then she like, get out my household
Bitch, this my household

Fussin and cussin an hour later
Up and down, like an elivator

You's in the front, I got you back, so keep them bitches off the side

Ain't nobody in betwene, you gotta pick a side
Cause one day, you gonna wake up, and that day, you back on mine
Tell the truth, that ass has ? hour or two
Mama said she raised a fool
Got them just for you, now I can't even stay mad at you
Got me in, then I'm out the mood

You fucked that bitch, played that shit cool, let me split that dick

No dealers and no feelings
