[Chorus]
I came a long way runnin' from the task force (task force)
Exotic whip do the digital dashboard (skrrt skrrt)
No movie date, I told her grab your passport (passport)
It's all on me, what more can you ask for? (ask for)
I did a show in your city (in your area)
I had some criminals with me (some felons)
She tryna tell me she different (come again?)
I'm really too high to listen (ugh)
I'm in the car with the stars (right now)
Pull up Wraith, double-R (skrrt)
Won't get no feelings involved (we don't)
Ice on my wrist and my heart (cold)

[Verse 1]
Hail mary, I came a long way (long, long way)
On dumb shit, up a one way goin' the wrong way (on some dumb shit)
Whipped up in the Maybach like I'm Gunplay (skrrt skrrt)
Fresh as fuck like I'm headed straight down the runway (down the runway)
All of this money we gettin'
My section flooded with women (flooded with bitches)
I bought a house for my dentist
Rose gold, pretty penny (that's a big bag)
My mama proud like Penny (Penny)
I took some goons out the trenches (hood)
They got some charges pending (what kind?)
They been robbin' for a livin' (take somethin')
She wanna dance but she ain't got the ass for it (got no ass)
Bought her Chanel, she didn't have to ask for it (she ain't say no words)
I swiped the card even though I had cash for it (the bag for it)
This shit was slow motion but now it's fast forward (move a lil fast)

[Chorus]
I came a long way runnin' from the task force (task force)
Exotic whip do the digital dashboard (skrrt skrrt)
No movie date, I told her grab your passport (passport)
It's all on me, what more can you ask for? (ask for)
I did a show in your city (in your area)
I had some criminals with me (some felons)
She tryna tell me she different (come again?)
I'm really too high to listen (ugh)
I'm in the car with the stars (right now)
Pull up Wraith, double-R (skrrt)
Won't get no feelings involved (we don't)
Ice on my wrist and my heart (cold)

[Verse 2]
She rock heels with the feet out (toe out)
I'm Balmain with the knee out (kneecap)
Did a show, brought the freaks out (hoes)
Forty thou', I ain't cheap now (nope)
I'm sippin' Act, got the bar bar, diamonds on cha cha
(What's that?), slide (dancin')
I'm rollin' up on a PJ, might land on the E-way
(Gon' do what?), glide
I'm with some hitters but they can't go out the country (why you say that?)
No matter the sitaution they gon' kill for me (some years for me)
They say I changed, I just hop in and change lanes (switch that lane)
Hit her from the back, all she hear is my chains clang (clang)
Shawty treat me like I'm more superior
But I'm hood with it, eatin' a bowl of cereal
Shitted on 'em with the new interior (ugh)
Skrrt skrrt, fast and the furious (skrrt)
Too dramatic, I can't take her serious
Told the lil bitch she got do's and dont's
Iced out her neck with exclusive stones
I asked lil baby what more do you want? (what more do you ask for?)

[Chorus]
I came a long way runnin' from the task force (task force)
Exotic whip do the digital dashboard (skrrt skrrt)
No movie date, I told her grab your passport (passport)
It's all on me, what more can you ask for? (ask for)
I did a show in your city (in your area)
I had some criminals with me (some felons)
She tryna tell me she different (come again?)
I'm really too high to listen (ugh)
I'm in the car with the stars (right now)
Pull up Wraith, double-R (skrrt)
Won't get no feelings involved (we don't)
Ice on my wrist and my heart (cold)
