[Intro]
Ah, fuck
We've been drinkin' a bit
Fuck it

[Chorus]
Got a fat chick twerking call it Royal Rumble
Smoking weed, pussy popping
Still my money humble
Serve her sausage in her face like we in Benihana
I'll let her bounce my stick like she a '64 Impala

[Verse 1]
Better to do you then do me
Energy Bruce Lee I'm OP
O.G. owner I live here profusely
Living motherfucker I'm out here
Don't test me motherfucker I've been there
See me get old pussy motherfucker like cougar
Let her suck that dick like a Henry Hoover
Swallow maneuver no need for the stain remover
Dog eat dog, call me Micheal Vick
I'm a dog when I chase a chick
I'm a dog when I get it get it
Doggie on a mission thinking you the shit?
Nah
Flex cos I'm on it
Flexing
Pumping 20 in a super set
I'm OP
Repping cos I'm really fully on it
Now they know me
Checking figures on the Internet
Yeah yeah yeah
Flew her over cause I pack a biggie
Doesn't wanna leave me but I gotta leave the city
Stick the landing like I'm bottle flipping major car
We whipping Lewis with the shipping and they wonder how my people killing
Exponential and they never knew it
Gucci Louis passion like I'm Hughy
Got me sitting back when I get to view it nigga
I'm a Bad when I get a Boujee bitch

[Chorus]
Got a fat chick twerking call it Royal Rumble
Smoking weed, pussy popping
Still my money humble
Serve her sausage in her face like we in Benihana
I'll Let her bounce my stick like she a '64 Impala

[Verse 2]
Why you so at mad me?
Attacking the ego with jealousy
I'm tryna do this whole thing in the peace
You're busy making an enemy
I am the remedy
I do this effortless
Pay for the team cause I'm generous
Venomous people try snaking us
But I'll cut the head off the snake
Maybe film it and cake and I don't need a break
Going and going till I overtake
Fly to L.A. I don't deal with the fake
I don't care what vid you want me to make
Shut the fuck up and get out of the face
Vids blowing up like I'm dropping a shell
Drove up to Brum to see Jay and Rommel
I'm always giving I'm living champagne with the winning
I'm balling and sinning with so many women
Cooking and cooking and now she so
Cooking and cooking attention I'm hooking
Cooking and cooking I kill it with bookings
Cause I got the recipe
Oh you're not scared, then you better be
I'm in control of the destiny
This ain't a game murky weather I'm coming to rain

[Chorus]
Got a fat chick twerking call it Royal Rumble
Smoking weed, pussy popping
Still my money humble
Serve her sausage in her face like we in Benihana
I'll Let her bounce my stick like she a '64 Impala
