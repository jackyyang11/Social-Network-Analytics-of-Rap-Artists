[Intro]
So, you've been gone a while
Yeah, I know
What have you been doing?
Learning, I've been doing a lot of learning
Yeah, I'm ready now

[Verse 1]
I ain't tryna tell anybody how to live
My only advice is to love and forgive
Everybody born in this world has a gift
The lightning strikes in your life but you'll live
Everytime we growing they'll try slowing all of the progress that we make
Fix up, look sharp, let them come all the way
Michael Bay how we blowing, glowing
Stars in the bay overflowing in our space
Blair like Tony, let them know we hit back like
One Punch Man, bring a fist to the scheme in the way
To the point of decay
No dead ringer, middle finger to all the bullshit
When they blare it in your motherfucking face
When they treat you like a motherfucking creature

[Chorus]
Creature
Machines
Machines
Creature

[Verse 2]
Oh okay, well then finish it
I ain't tryna tell anybody what to do
But this is how it smells when you're raised in a zoo
They teach you how to sell, how to aim, how to shoot
Then when you end up in a jail then they'll blame it on you (on you)
That's not how I'm having it
Fuck you, I'm hijacking it
I'ma full blown go attacking it
People can you hear me
Said that's not how I'm having it
Fuck you, I'm hijacking it
I'ma full blown go attacking it
People can you hear me?
From the front to the back I'ma reacher like Jack
Man don't care what the people say
I'ma get the ting my own way
Take my whole name and own it
Can't control me and you know it
I'ma kill it when you treat me like a motherfucking creature

[Chorus]
Creature
Machines
Machines
Creature
