Hm Hm Hm
Hm Hm Hm Hm
You dare test me

Zeeshan

[Verse 1]
Ares looking down on the boy feeling like he at the top
Now you better listen 'cos this nigga never wanted hippodrome
But I gotta let them know you're a flop
Not a single boom with 4 records on the trot
Now the little Ben was mad that his records never popped
'Till he spoke about his idol
Now he's going viral
Biggest song you'll ever make is author of the bible
I'm the creed of the crop
The rocky with the cash
While you're tryna say the words
Suffering succotash
Baby panicking awkward like mannequin
Motherfucker we're battling
This the fall of the Anakin
Make you missing like Madeleine
You're a fan
FIFA to the football to the rapping
My reply got you jizzing was fishing and baited the stan
Please don't speak again
Hold up with your venting
Ain't it wonderful
That I'm out here reinventing your career

[Bridge]
Keep it measure for measure where is your Isabella (Hm)
Shorty left and you struggled to keep it all together (Ay)
Not the first time you're dissing remember me and Weller
Looking back at the reinstating that you're a fan forever

[Verse 2]
Fuck your grade 5
You don't need to lie
Glad I made you better 'cos your other shit was dry
Had to make you wait 'cos I'm always up lifting
Scrawny with your size maybe try some weightlifting
Between me and you
No one wants to be you
Looked at your past even you know it's true
Look at that baby face, look at that baby face
You can't intimidate
Boy it's my creed to assassinate
I'm not one to agitate
Crying that my roster overpowered like the Golden State
Corny rappers try'na build a coup so they can elevate
No one's even ever heard of you
Until I commentated and slated
Got irritated and hated
But deep inside you're elated
You even tweeted and rated the lyrical miracle
This you peaking at pinnacle
Taste of your medicine going and flowing at minimal
Show me you're unusual
Spit a verse where I'm not as a feature
Bet it's never better than the dissing at your teacher
Bet it never blows up all according to your preacher
Calculated moves
I'm the instigator
Forever in my shadow blessing like your given name
I'm drinking desperado you can't even do the same
Commend your new bravado
Thank me 'cos I'm here to blame
And if we ever played
I'll still beat you at a FIFA game

[Beat switch]

[Verse 3]
Hahaha
Dax
Stop it man you ain't that
Poor man's Hopsin now wanna box
Please, you're gonna get dropped
Now crypt wanna hop on my dick
Stupid little prick you were never involved
You can rap fast but you can't make a hit
Lullaby Rap or die hope you die, bitch
I got no label
And I always kill it like Cain and Abel
Can't be broke, I'll revoke your progress
'Cos I am the table
You bitches are botching
I'm the one that they paid to be watching
You tried with the diss
Got you bare views with the vids
Tried to score but you missed
Haa

[Verse 4]
I am the king of the drama
Cream of the crop
I'm the new age farmer
Puppet man I don't stop it man
I give all the shit with no karma
I am untouchable I got the rocket fuel
I am unstoppable nothing impossible
Album impeccable touring while winning as me
Years in the game and I do it so easily
"I'm a Celebrity" called for me
I said no to that shit
I don't need to eat dick
I'm self made in this bitch
I'm like Raid when I spray
People die when I prey
People lie when I slay
Jack of all trades and I mastered it all as I win
Bring out the Perry and prove I'm a king
Q-Q-Quad

[Outro]
Hahaha
This shit's easy for me
All day, every day
Number one
Ay ay, ay ay, ay ay
GG Motherfucker
