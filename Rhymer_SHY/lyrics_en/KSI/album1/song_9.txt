So can I get a fucking encore? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Can I get a fucking encore? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Can I get a fucking encore? (Yeah, motherfucker, motherfucker)
Can I get a fucking encore? (Shit, shit, oh)

[Verse 1: KSI]
The hype man is here
Started from FIFA to top of the tier
Got all of these stacks
"How did you do it?" is all that I hear
Man’s doing everything
Going from BRITS to us
Making that movie thing
Flying from Vegas to Napa to partying
Watching the progress I show in The Guardian
But that’s old news
First-born bringing the bread to the table
Viewing the shot on the low, other mans on the hype
Counting P’s on the top of that label
(Man) You gotta admit it
Nothing untrue when I go to just spit it
Then, my team is just killing it
Fam is just killing it
Proud of them all and I'm here to fulfil init

[Hook: KSI]
So can I get a fucking encore? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Can I get a fucking encore? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Can I get a fucking encore? (Yeah, motherfucker, motherfucker)
Can I get a fucking encore? (Shit, shit, oh)

[Verse 2: Randolph]
Oh man, time to remind ‘em
This my last encore, no more rewinding
We be doing this for time and time again
About time you were tuning in
About time they were noticin'
That I’ve been going in
I'm back now and I’m closing in
To the high places I’m supposed to be in, uh
So, don’t insult me again, yeah
Anxiety, tryna get the better of me
Tryna make me forget that I am legendary
Won’t stop ’til they see me in the cemetery
I might fall, no hate is ever getting to me
It’s a new level that I been on
No more checkpoints, it’s here, it's the one
Yeah, I’m my own man now
I do whatever I want

[Hook: KSI]
So can I get a fucking encore? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Can I get a fucking encore? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Can I get a fucking encore? (Yeah, motherfucker, motherfucker)
Can I get a fucking encore? (Shit, shit, oh)
