I'm getting dollar dollar bills in this bitch
I'm getting hundred million dollar dollar deals in this bitch
Check that shit, I'm hella rich
Time is money so check that hour
Made your salary in that hour
Backhand will.i.am 'cuz I'm the one with POWER

You complaining, motherfucker?
Go play Evolution Soccer
It can go and suck my dick
While I'm making money quick
Got few licensed teams
Robotic themes
Some extremes
Make their means
And it seems
"Fun" is what they say this screams

Unit levels sold this season is the real fucking deal
Got Vegeta's scouter screaming "Power level is unreal"
On that next gen, cashing checks
Even while I'm on the crapper
Man is gassed, going into clubs
Just go slap a slapper

"Fix your servers" is what these niggas say
But we're beating PES on that server shit every day
Have you tried to play on there?
And you say our shit's unfair?
Man, Kozuki needs to go get drop kicked by a constipated bear

Yeah, saying that there's scripting
Stupid douche, the timer stops at 45
If the timer carried on
Would scripting be alive?
Nah
You just can't defend
Find another excuse to hide why you're a shit bellend

So, um, hopefully my message has been loud and clear
And, most of all, buy my game
Thank you
