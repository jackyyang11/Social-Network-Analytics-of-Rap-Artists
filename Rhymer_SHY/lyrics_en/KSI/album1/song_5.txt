Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ok, i'm making a success by doing the Haber process
This is what we do to get the product Ammonia
Cos i'm tellin' ya, about the temperature
And what it needs to be, so just wait and see...

First we need a bit of (Hydrogen)
And from the air we get some (Nitrogen)
Now we gotta just (purify this stuff)
And pass it over a Catalyst, so we have enough (nuff, nuff)
Now I must say this part (is, kinda tough)
But we can't mess up, or even (try to give up)
450 Celsius is what we need for the Temperature
And 200 A.T.M for the pressure...

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

So as I wonder behind my desk
I ask myself some questions, since we gotta test
Why can't we use 0 Celcius for the Temperature?
Then it hit me...,
It would (take too long)
And this is why (i'm writing this song)
Instead of playing (some bad ass ping pong)
So, what's the deal for (no 100% yield?)
Cos, it's an equilibrium, (reversible like a playing field)
A forward reaction is where the reaction creates the product
And a reversible reaction is where the reaction decomposed the product
So this is the end of this (AWE-SOME-SONG)
And at this rate, I can't get a (question wrong)
