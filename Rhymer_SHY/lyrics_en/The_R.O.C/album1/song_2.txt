[Verse 1: The R.O.C.]
Your lipstick is red, the sight of it blinds me
The sweat above your lip looks so crisp, so enticing
I keep on hiding, spying, just eyeing
Your movement, so lucid, while I am just biding
My time till designed in my mind, I'm vying
For more of your core, but the shadows keep hiding
I am just driving, my nerves are just flying
So off in this trough of my thoughts, have you dying
Behind you I scream, "Make you my cake"
Wait, partake in this race across Crystal Lake - pace
You hear my breathing, may be your last mistake
Mental break you face
So don't turn around, chase

[Hook: The R.O.C.]
Don't look behind you
Murder is in the air tonight
Don't look behind you
Kill 'em all on sight
Don't look behind you
There's not much time, hurry rhyme
Don't look behind you
Oh my god, here it comes

Maybe am I dreaming
Don't look behind you
I don't want to see it
Don't look behind you
Can't escape believing
Don't look behind you
I don't want to feel this

[Verse 2: The R.O.C.]
Deep in the darkness is pure, hellish evil
Times are quite medieval, way before the prequel
Jump you like Knievel, there will be no upheaval
No part twos or sequels, it's just that fecal
I prune the body parts to make you part of my art
Your heart becomes the chart that leads straight to the chord
Cause in this dance, there's no van, nor a man
Just a plan with a plan to devour you like Lecter, and
You have no chance to advance
You think you can and you're my universe
You never met a thing more worse in any verse
You can't outrun, this sounds absurd
With these stab divisions blurred
Can't detect, I'm up for slurs
Above those deaths that have occurred

[Hook]

[Verse 3: The R.O.C.]
My return was imminent like the Dark Knight
Tearing up your mentals like an all out bar fight
Mask why it's every cop
Sound alerts, no standby
I'm already blocked, stopped
Drop shot and lock behind
Parcel aids stop, chopped all in 'em
Giving hopes, that dill soaked venom
Mean and blues, no we's or twos
Evil dudes all seem to get ya
Colder than the coldest winter
Blows and rolls, your body's our blister
Ice breathing, a relief for a sinner
Nosferatu, paragraph spitter
Chase like walking dead
But I'm more than a talking head
I spread faster than legs on a hooker in the bed
I pledge to keep you running in the night, fleeing for your life
With a knife I am the thing, please don't look behind...

[Hook]
