[Intro]:
I'm the one your mother warned you about see
A role model a superhero that's not me
There's no escaping there is no more hiding
I got the power its so
Hey you

[Verse 1]:
Look into my eyes then
Please oh please just be advised when
My gaze instant truth to violence
Guess you wylin
Spit the silence
Get this motherfucker up we rising
Don't turn up even higher crime and
Heads are flying
Maids are dying
Get your motherfucking piece of the pie then
This whole parties jumping
Cops leave us alone
I need a drink please
Someone pass that patron
I'm in my zone yelling bitch don't kill my vibe
To sit your ass back girl and enjoy the ride
(Nigga you ain't all that)
You right cause I'm underground
Dirt crawling up
Just make the rounds
And check the sounds
It's raid aloud
You get wild peep the smile
No way out just serve the crown
Swing right till the nightlife ain't no foul
Just let me in it I check with your mentals now

[Hook]:
I'm the one your mother warned you about see
A role model a superhero that's not me
There's no escaping there is no more hiding
I got the power it's so hypnotizing
I'm the one your mother warned you about see
A role model a superhero that's not me
There's no escaping there is no more hiding
I got the power it's so
Hey you

[Verse 2]:
Step up close to the phone
The best ride of your life and mo'
Stop back then like you don't know
Like I can't flow I got the slope
Nah you hook won't let you die
You gotta be a part of the night
Of that living dead
Where there ain't no sleep
Ain't got no bed
Ain't got no peace
No yo
Don't be surprised
If we get up to hang life
From that grave straight shot to the sky
Please hold tight stop asking why
We will survive cause I said so
Chalking spears for the double m-o
Gone red line infuse mine
With crowds behind yo info
That you receive from all that hate
I coast them to exacerbate
Till they just off themselves
That's fate
We don't have to see
Ain't no way
Catch em adrift
Like gorgon take
That's just life don't exaggerate
Just take a place in an empty space
Ill asservate
Then resonate yo

[Hook]:
I'm the one your mother warned you about see
A role model a superhero that's not me
There's no escaping there is no more hiding
I got the power it's so hypnotizing
I'm the one your mother warned you about see
A role model a superhero that's not me
There's no escaping there is no more hiding
I got the power it's so
Hey you

[Verse 3]:
My pupils gaining pupils
Just keep looking
While I won't refuse you
You won't accuse you made to loot you
So you in tune with most my rules
So don't come around here with no hate
Keep that shit up out my face
Keep that shit from around this way
Look closely at the way we play
Cause we don't get up
We just get down
May come to life
That wicked sound
There ain't no way to leave us now
The vibes to strong
We homebound
Energy is just crisp
Slow it to get you hooked in
Hades cast to 40's C
When I spend time resolution
Yes I will include friends
All that rhyme that you move in
Cause all that noise outside the box
Y'all just need to lose them shit

[Outro]:
I'm the one your mother warned you about see
A role model a superhero that's not me
There's no escaping there is no more hiding
I got the power it's so
