[Verse 1: The R.O.C]
My rooftop is gone along with this song
Dedicated to all let's fade it beyond the lights roam
Right between the legs of the brunette and blonde standing next to me
I'm nasty not wrong my rocks are off so long chickens
I drive into the sunset pumping superstition by Stevie
Blindfolded jumping cliffs while turning into a clip wild
Now I'm drugged and bitches wiles are foul are off
Like the pitch Jamie threw Kate the voucher
I get wilder terrifying terrible before sun raise
Or knew your nature okay start the hood okay
I go play with dead things now
My head won't be found and if you do klick pow

[Hook: The R.O.C.]
They'll never know where my heads at oh
Detached from my shoulders yes a long time ago
No way out my rhymes equal murders
Stingy when I spit I'm sick let's turn up
One cut two slice three stick four
Five let's bury em underneath the floor
Cause my demise is itching to get loose
And once it do
Your worst nightmares will all come true

[Verse 2: G-Mo Skee]
Let's take it back
Before I signed to a rap label
22 years ago when my brain would act stable
At the family reunion my cousin took me out my damn cradle
And accidentally dropped me on a glass table
On that day I turned into a problem child
Cussing up a storm who cares if my moms around
Bugging out when teachers would tell me to watch my mouth
I ain't say shit bitch what the fuck you talking about
You talking about a pyromaniac starting fire
He's got your block looking like it was made out of carbon fiber
Screwing the holes in a funeral home I'm putting lube in the holes eating pubes full of mold
Back in school I was told I had the ugliest face in class
Now I gotta skin these bitches just to make a mask
Everything I touch I break in half
And I ain't scared of nobody
Jeffrey Dahmer was a flaming fag

[Hook: The R.O.C.]
They'll never know where my heads at oh
Detached from my shoulders yes a long time ago
No way out my rhymes equal murders
Stingy when I spit I'm sick let's turn up
One cut two slice three stick four
Five let's bury em underneath the floor
Cause my demise is itching to get loose
And once it do
Your worst nightmares will all come true

[Verse 3: The R.O.C.]
Ding bell rings and I'm out
I got no interest reroute
You won't find my mentals floating about
Constantly screaming Lupin SOS
No one can help me out this mess
Address cause less ain't no causing his death
Cmon yall I need applause coffee break time
No sign of the line decreasing my fines
And crease what every spine no bone
I use for vocal motion my thirst for souls
My the sounds of the ocean mouth dog
Probably grossing them out
I need a better way
My brain seems to be on strike today
Collecting my thoughts right away
I can play with the kids up the street
So I can hit em in the head with the drumbeat
So get they better know my flows are death
And a resurrection don't make sense
When I'm still fucking fresh I pull my weapon in a pinch
Best at nothing hoe ass
Yeah fuck your lass with the magic ninja sword up that ass
Cocksuckers I'm gone

[Hook: The R.O.C.]
They'll never know where my heads at oh
Detached from my shoulders yes a long time ago
No way out my rhymes equal murders
Stingy when I spit I'm sick let's turn up
One cut two slice three stick four
Five let's bury em underneath the floor
Cause my demise is itching to get loose
And once it do
Your worst nightmares will all come true

[Hook: The R.O.C.]
They'll never know where my heads at oh
Detached from my shoulders yes a long time ago
No way out my rhymes equal murders
Stingy when I spit I'm sick let's turn up
One cut two slice three stick four
Five let's bury em underneath the floor
Cause my demise is itching to get loose
And once it do
Your worst nightmares will all come true
