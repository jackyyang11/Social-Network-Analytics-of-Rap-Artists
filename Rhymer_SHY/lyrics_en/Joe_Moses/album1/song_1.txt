I'm just feeling myself

Excuse me baby it's the kid himself
Took a bath in some roses to find my fresh
It's an honor to be here, I get it live myself
16s is like a birthday I surprise myself

So clap it up for the nigga that you came to see
54th to Hollywood it ain't no change in me
I'm a lion out the cage, it ain't no taming me
Spit crack in the booth, it's the caine in me
Sophisticated mother fucker, momma raised a beast
God talking through my pen and he telling me preach
Rappers looking like a meal, competition be frees
Meech the only other person that had more birds than me
When I big up a nigga, I'm big enough to do it
Can't a nigga cool me off, I'm the bottom of cooler
Metaphore so precise, I'm the nicest and truest
Rest in peace to my pops, he the one influenced

Excuse me baby it's the kid himself
Took a bath in some roses to find my fresh
It's an honor to be here, I get it live myself
16s is like a birthday I surprise myself

Follow me down the street to the yellow brick road
Could turn 3 into 9 but I ain't talking a stove
Keep your ass out the streets if you don't follow the code
Sold powder for a living but I don't powder my nose
Too legit with a hammer, better let me be
Bitch I'm the one with the ball, I'm the only pg
Crossed over with the rock, I'm the closest to be
And you the man in the streets when there's more than a beat
When it's more than a verse, opposite to the herse
See this is 800 years of my people been cursed
And you can get in your house what you get in the church
Just wanna take care of y'all, no nurse
Just had a chance to work
My only hurt is hurting my own kind
Gotta thank the man above for giving me my shine
Took the gun from my life, not looking for no crime
But if a nigga round up I'm P Diddy and Shyne

Excuse me baby it's the kid himself
Took a bath in some roses to find my fresh
It's an honor to be here, I get it live myself
16s is like a birthday I surprise myself

Black man black man why you hate your skin
See every time that you kill you killing off your kin
Don't wanna contradict myself, who am I to repent
But if you gotta hear the truth you should hear it from me
See I started with the gang cos this is all I know
I never joined a gang for no fame or no wealth
So when I call these nigga brother, niggas all I know
And if we gotta make a change then we should all wanna help
Cos if we think about the past and the pain we felt
Stand tall, shit enough is enough, shit I'm speaking for self
Don't wanna see no mums cry no more, I'd rather see a fight, no one die no more

Excuse me baby it's the kid himself
Took a bath in some roses to find my fresh
It's an honor to be here, I get it live myself
16s is like a birthday I surprise myself
