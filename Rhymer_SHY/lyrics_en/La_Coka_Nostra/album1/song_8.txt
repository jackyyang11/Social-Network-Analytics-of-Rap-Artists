I can't live like this no more
They know my name at the liquor store
I get high, give dick to hoes
I can't live like this no more
Lost in the bottle, of course I'm the bottom of the barrel
No apparel except for being a loser and an asshole
Trust in drugs, arrogant, they keep me happy
The same thing that's killing me is the same thing that traps me
It transports me, sometimes it transforms me
So I feel like I'm getting a blowjob in a porn scene
Sometimes I feel like I'm a millionaire with no worries
A lazy fuck stuck on the couch in no hurry
No ambition, no plans or future
Got two bitches pregnant at the same time
One is due in a month, the other in a week
They don't even know about each other
And I don't even love either of them
And I'm a piece of shit, a real piece of work
A womanizer, it's a wonder that my penis even works
This sore throat won't go away, I go to see the doctor
Only to find out that I'm dying with the monster
Yeah, Bacardi bottles litter the floor, bicker with whores
Liquor in drawers, the alcoholic sticking up stores
Scratch tickets is all losers, owe 30 to the bookie
He wanna murder me, I'm up inside a dirty pussy
Warts burned off my dick by a doctor, I'm sick
I keep chasing dreams that I'm not gonna get
I might as well spend my days in a bottle
Night inside a cell doing coke and steroids got my body hot as hell
I'll probably rot in Hell, yeyo that I gotta sell
Is all sniffed, my future is dog shit
My best friend's a dope fiend and he can't get off it
My music is in the trash, I can't turn a profit
I just drank every dollar that I murdered off it
My brain keeps leaking like a turning faucet
I'm sneezing for no reason with a burning nostril
I started off being decent now I'm turning hostile
