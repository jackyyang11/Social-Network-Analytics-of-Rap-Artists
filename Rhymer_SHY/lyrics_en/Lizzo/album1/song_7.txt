My great-grandmomma ain’t a slave
My great great great great great grandmother
Was a maid
I think that were just made of the same thing
Keeping it together, got the brave in the membrane


Ticky, tick tick that keeps you sane
Are the remnants reminiscing in my brain
1947 when he caught that train
And met my momma’s momma in the pouring rain
Ok, light skinned brother with the hazel eyes
Cause ain’t nobody messing with VJ
I got a sense of humor, I theorize
From everything he sent down my way
Bloodlines, like cousins like loving
It’s nothing. Put them down when its tough
And tie those loose ends to make them meet
Everything is gravy when your people live down the street

I see ya, so wait…
Take this before you escape
Don’t make the past feel like a mistake (repeat)

Swirling, black abyss
Stardust misting, raining down
Shining like the gems of eternity
Formulating for me and mine
Perhaps one day we can mine
Throwing all those minerals and chemical elements
Into the pot
Uh-oh we’re getting hot
Through some sun on the stove top
Close the lid, beware of the pop
Of the splash back
Add a dash of that acid
Voila
One day we’ll show our kids what we did the Big bang


Dearly beloved, we’re gathered here today
Witnessing something that we cannot explain
Dearly departed, we’re gather here today
Witnessing something that we cannot explain
[repeat till end]
