My ni-hick-a, momma hiccup
Got to pick up the holiday
And check plus the tip cos
Bounces right off they dinner
You lookin like, I say what
I am the breadwinner
You a crip bruh
Just the tip, cuz
Got to go how you say
Bouts the dim sum
Heavy setter, jet-setter

Oh you too hoe tell me
You ain't riding the best whips son
Bouncing all in your courtroom
Objectify and undress you
Till you ask one in the darkroom
Exposure bitch, don't get sued
Big business, say forever
That's a mighty long time
A wise woman once told me
Even

And you can't see me
Even if you have binoculars
You can't see me
Even if you have glasses
You can't read me
All these bitches in the coup
Looking like Stevie

Yup
Bout to post my list on the wall
Of the school auditroium
Tacked up neatly
Sheets upon, sheets upon sheets
Weeks upon, weeks upon weeks
That these people cold feet

Ive got a tissue for you boo-hoos
Hip-hop guys round singing the blues
I ain't talking bout the rapper
I'm talking bout the gift beneath the wrappers
Called a happily ever after
Fact is, it ain't too late
You still been making them hits
Since the seventh grade
Big business, say forever
That's a mighty long time
A wise woman once told me

And you can't see me
Even if you have binoculars
You can't see me
Even if you have glasses
You can't read me
All these bitches in the coup
Looking like Stevie
