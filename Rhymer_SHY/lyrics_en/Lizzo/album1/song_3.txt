(Here we are)
(and all my big girls tell ‘em)
(here we are)
(bigger than the sun and the moon)

We can take over the earth
We can take over the earth

Too bad you couldn't be on the roster
Ya man, ya dig, ya can't speak rasta
Betty SpaghettiOs, no pasta
Just hog the coin like Whore-hey Washington

Poster child for big black ambition
Coattail-flunking and Timmy's wishlist
Tim chance be the only thing on my wishlist
Fried chicken and a bottle of Seagram's

Right?

Stereotypical archetypes
Arching and bishing, get radio play, like
Im'ma fit right in today
Let me get a seat at the front of the Grammys
Let me get a little bit of bitter grapes
I can't want what I want anyway
So I just kick back like Kid ‘n’ Play
Staying on the come-up like, 'that's my play'

Cinderella , 2am, ain’t got nothin’ on the way I keep the movin’
Shoot the hits and out the lat to rap the lap (/??)
Rappers all about the double enten-dres
Andre the Giant, on Dre the three stacks
Poppin chick peas like some andre manila
Manila your rice up and (red?)

Bigger than the sun and the moon
I can feel it in my bones, we can take over the world
And all my big girls tell it
Let the big girls tell it
(Listen!)

Come on, come on, welcome to Earth
We like to kill each other, turn each other to dirt
Got a lotta money? You the man now, babe
Better break me off some, Imma show you crazy
Show y’all crazy anyway
Any way you wanna slice that key lime tasty
Got my batches and cookies, gettin’ nasty on sookie
Me and Sophia did it all for the nookie

Fame, love and money
It’s powerful thangs if you think it is
But the thang is, it’s thankless to be the baddest chick who ain’t naked
That’s cool, what’s cool, I ain’t postin’ flick
You a magician you like turnin’ tricks
Got a trick for you, or maybe a treat
Now get your freak on a leash and lick my feet
I am on another level
Elevator, escalator, brahman
Pocahontas in her corset shading the Queen of England I am

Fools be like “The precipice is the end”
But I think it’s the beginnin’ (what)
Close your eyes and take the leap
Watch ‘em wave as you fly to the top no drop
(fly)

(her- here- here- here we are)
(yo can take- take- watch us take over)

It’s bigger than the sun and the moon
I can feel it in my bones, we can take over the world
And all my big girls tell it
Let the big girls tell it
Bigger than the sun and the moon
I can feel it in my bones, we can take over the world
And all my big girls tell it
Let the big girls tell it
