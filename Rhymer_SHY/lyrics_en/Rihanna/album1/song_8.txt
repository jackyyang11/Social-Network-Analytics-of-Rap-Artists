[Verse 1: Beyonce]
He wanna feel my summer rain
The thunder roar, yeah he wanna bang
All of these bitches but he want the coldest yeah
Cuz you prima donnas got nothin' on me
Classy, seductive, a devil in Prada yeah
Turn on your cameras there's something to see
(Cameras in motion from this pop star controversy Rihanna
Another day another new photo of Rihanna
Getting involved in the currents and current)

[Pre-Chorus: Both]
I guess I got a reputation now
Call me Cruella, Medusa, that's something I'm used to
I-I-I I'm sure you heard the story
And I'm the one to blame
A thousand hearts are broken
But love is a game so fuck what you sayin'

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Lord knows, I must be a 10
I'm a 12 to a 10
You can't fuck with me
No Lord, Lord knows, this shit be everything
Don't give a fuck but I'm celibate
I'm on my selfish shit
You cain't mess with this
Cuz I'ma
Bad bitch

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
Get a space where my heart was
There's a crater
I got feelings but no hard ones
See you later
Get a space where my heart was
There's a crater
(But I got, But I got)
I got feelings but no hard ones
See you later

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
I guess I got a reputation now
Call me Cruella, Medusa, that's something I'm used to
I-I-I I'm sure you heard the story
And I'm the one to blame
A thousand hearts are broken
But love is a game so fuck what you sayin'

[Chorus: Both]
Lord knows, I must be a 10
I'm a 12 to a 10
You can't fuck with me
No Lord, Lord knows, this shit be everything
Don't give a fuck but I'm celibate
