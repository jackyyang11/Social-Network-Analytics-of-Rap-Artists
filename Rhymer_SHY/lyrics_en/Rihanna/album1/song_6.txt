[Intro]
Ohh
Ohh

[Verse 1]
Some girls play the game
They all walk and talk and they dress the same
Nothing new to say
Don't they realize
That it's so easy to see right through their disguise
Makes me wonder why

[Pre-Chorus]
When the whole world's turning left
It's when I'm going right
I need someone to let me be
Just who I am inside

[Chorus]
'Cause a girl like me
Is just a little different from all the rest
And a girl likes me
Never gonna settle for second best
Could it be a boy like you
That would give me anything
If I asked him to
To take all my dreams
And make them true
Show me all the reasons that you
Ought to be with a girl like me
Just like me

[Verse 2]
Possibility
Got me trippin'
Thinkin' of what could be
Between you and me
Still, I need to know
Should I keep this feeling
Or let it go
I can't wait no more
So now's the time
To speak your mind
And Show me what you feel
So tell me if you
Want to take a chance
On something real

[Chorus]
'Cause a girl like me
Is just a little different from all the rest
And a girl likes me
Never gonna settle for second best
Could it be a boy like you
That would give me anything
If I asked him to
To take all my dreams
And make them true
Show me all the reasons that you
Ought to be with a girl like me
Just like me

[Bridge]
Mirror Mirror, on the wall
Catch me now before I fall
I wish I may, I wish I might
Find the answer here tonight
Mirror Mirror, on the wall
Catch me now before I fall
I wish I may, I wish I might
Find the answer here tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
When the whole world's turning left
It's when I'm going right
I need someone to let me be
Just who I am inside

[Chorus]
'Cause a girl like me
Is just a little different from all the rest
And a girl likes me
Never gonna settle for second best
Could it be a boy like you
That would give me anything
If I asked him to
To take all my dreams
And make them true
Show me all the reasons that you
Ought to be with a girl like me
Just like me
