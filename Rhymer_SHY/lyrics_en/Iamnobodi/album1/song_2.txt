[Verse 1:]

Tell me what the hell just happened
Used to be so right
Crying, screaming, laughing
Each and every night
All the things that I wanted just take so much time
Yeah, you saw that I suffer
Everything, all of the time
All the time
All the time

[Hook:]

REACTION, baby
REACTION
REACTION, baby
REACTION, baby
REACTION, baby
Everything, all of the time
REACTION, baby
Everything, all of the time

[Bridge:]
Every day I move with passion, baby
This is how it seems to remember
But they say that love is everlasting, lasting

[Hook:]
