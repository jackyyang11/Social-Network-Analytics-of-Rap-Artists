[Verse]
Sometimes behind your pretty smile I see
All your pain, your frustrations and misery
Girl, when you feeling turbulence and your ways doesn't get rocky
When you need someone to talk to, you can come to me

[Hook]
It's not your sex even not your beauty, you're my friend
It's not your sex even not your beauty, you're my friend

[Verse]
Someday you'll find a husband and child of your own
And someday you'll finally find a place that you can call home
Baby when you feeling turbulence and your ways doesn't get rocky
When you need someone to talk to, my God, girl u can talk to me

[Hook]
It's not your sex even not your beauty, you're my friend, yes you are
It's not your sex even not your beauty, you're my friend, yes you are

[Bridge]
Could it be, break it down, one time
Whatever you need, you can count on me, I'll be there, I'll be there
A friend indeed, for whatever you'll do, I'll come running to you

[Hook]
It's not your sex even not your beauty you're my friend, yes you are
It's not your sex even not your beauty you're my friend, yes you are
