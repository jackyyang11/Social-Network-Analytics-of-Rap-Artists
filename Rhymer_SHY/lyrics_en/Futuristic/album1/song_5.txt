[Verse 1]
Yeah, I just wanna ride with my niggas
In Arizona top down in the winter
And anybody talking down I forgive 'em
A peace sign then its bye I forget 'em
And I've been looking at everybody around me
With a smile, for a while, see my style
Then they biting harder than a crocodile
But I'm flattered
Yo, let's make it happen
All the madness is happiness in my humble opinion
I plan on finishing this race with everyone I begin with
And letting everybody eat, that just what come with the friendship
And I'mma always keep it real, I ain't with all the pretending
And if all these haters want to hate, than that's all good
Y'all jealous maybe yall should do something productive
Maybe yall could
Be in the same position make a living I worked hard and it worked out splendid nigga, I knew that it all would

[Chorus 1]
And if you need someone to hate on, than feel free to hate on me (hate on me)
And if you need someone to wait on, well that ain't in my genes
I told pops that I'mma get this guap, and I told mama I'mma make this run
If you dont agree, that's okay with me
Cause I ain't got no beef running through my blood
So i say
L is for the way, they used to laugh at me (used to laugh at me)
O that means ohh, now they wanna be on my team (wanna be on my team)
V is very very extra ordinary indeed (indeed)
E is even more, reasons I need to succeed
And it's all love

[Verse 2]
Yeah, how you doing? Doing swell
Then I'm gone. Wish me well
How you doing? A-okay
Everyday. Feeling great
How you doing? Living good
Only thing I wish, I wish somebody would
How you doing? Doing Fine
And my girl is fine, and she only mine
Yo, it's all love
Meet a stranger with a smile, homie it's all hugs
Got a bottle and a joint, but I'mma skip hard drugs
The team of misfit kids, rocking it's all trust
I don't carry round a gavel, who am I to be the judge
Vocabulary is scrabble with the rise up in the plug
So if they're getting outta pocket, I'mma treat 'em like a socket
I'mma catch a charge and then I leave them lying on the rug

[Chorus 2]
And if you need someone to hate on, then feel free to hate on me (hate on me)
And if you need someone to wait on, well that ain't in my genes
I told pops that I'mma get this guap, and I told mama I'mma make this run
If you dont agree, that's okay with me
Cause I ain't got no beef running through my blood
So I say
L is for the way, they used to laugh at me (used to laugh at me)
O that means ohh, now they wanna be on my team (wanna be on my team)
V is very very extraordinary indeed (indeed)
E is even more, reasons I need to succeed
And it's all love
And it's all love
And it's all love
And it's all love
(And it's all love)
