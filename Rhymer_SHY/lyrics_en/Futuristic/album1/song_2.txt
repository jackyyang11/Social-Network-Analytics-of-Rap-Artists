[Intro: Futuristic]
I don't know why you keep telling your friends you don't like me
Sending me them text with smiley faces and what not
I mean you making it so obvious, just admit it

[Hook: Donnyray]
I think she like me
But she don't wanna admit it
Or better yet I know that she's feeling me
Guarantee I can get it
She got a thing for me
Tell me what it's gon' be, baby girl is you with it
Cause I think she like me
But she don't wanna admit it

[Verse 1: Futuristic]
Here he go again mister arrogant asshole
He ain't got a job, but he claim that he rap though
Always trying to brag 'bout his kicks and his cashflow
All the pretty girls that came out to his last show
What you mad for? What the problem is
I ain't like them other dudes, that always be hollering
I know you educated, you look like a college chick
Won't hit you with them pick up lines
You don't wanna be bothered with
Forget that, skip the games, it's Futuristic, don't forget the name
We finna rage later on if you think you can hang
I'll take you back to the crib if you finna drank
Walk of shame in the morning out the condo
Then you off to work like pronto
You can rock my hoodie cause it's chilly outside like Toronto
I need you on my team like I'm doc and you rondo

[Hook: Donnyray]
I think she like me
But she don't wanna admit it
Or better yet I know that she's feeling me
Guarantee I can get it
She got a thing for me
Tell me what it's gon' be, baby girl is you with it
Cause I think she like me
But she don't wanna admit it

[Verse 2: Futuristic]
A lot of fish in the sea, but I know you'll take the bate
I met a lot of sweet girls, but you take the cake
I'm feeling like Trey Songz, I can't help but wait
Close the drapes, light the candles and put on that babyface
So we could babymake JK, for real though
You could scream my name 'til the feathers fly out the pillow
Leave you draped over, like branches on weeping willows
I can't lie you got me hard as the shell on a armadillo
That’s good I got you laughing, I'm a funny dude
I'm just trying to kick it, like David Beckham and kangaroos
A lot of things that’s on my mind and I could name a few
But we should conversate about you, what I came to do
And I'm a patient dude so maybe I can wait for you
But please do not start talking 'bout buying houses and baby shoes
I'm not clueless I know what you sprung ladies do
I know you feel me girl so just say it's true

[Hook: Donnyray]
I think she like me
But she don't wanna admit it
Or better yet I know that she's feeling me
Guarantee I can get it
She got a thing for me
Tell me what it's gon' be, baby girl is you with it
Cause I think she like me
But she don't wanna admit it

[Bridge: Donnyray]
She like me, she like me, she like me, she like me, she like me
She likes for sure
She acting like she don’t
I don’t know why she won't
Why she won't admit it
I guarantee I can get it
Tell me girl is you with it
Just admit it

[Hook: Donnyray]
I think she like me
But she don't wanna admit it
Or better yet I know that she's feeling me
Guarantee I can get it
She got a thing for me
Tell me what it's gon' be, baby girl is you with it
Cause I think she like me
But she don't wanna admit it

[Outro: Donnyray]
She like me, she like me, she like me
She like me, she like me, she like me
But she won't admit it, I guarantee I can get It
Girl is you with it, just admit it
