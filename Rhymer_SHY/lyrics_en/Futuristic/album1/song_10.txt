[Verse 1]
They actin' like they know me, they see me in videos
Where was you when I was out doin' them shitty shows
Everybody postin' this nigga, he finna blow
These biddies in every city be showin' their titties, bro
Oh no, here he go, that boy cold
The dope flow, expose rappers, I'm no joke
You Eminem on 8 Mile, the first show
Like a girl with no gag reflex, I won't choke
Broke niggas hit me
Like, "Aye bro, let me hold fifty"
They see me in the club gettin' hugs with more bottles of CÎROC
At my table then Diddy, tell me who was fuckin' with me
When I didn't have this
When my YouTube didn't have hits
When I wasn't always with a bad bitch
Now my wallet and my girl mad thick

[Hook]
Remember way back then?
I was tryna get it right, hit up Mickey D's then split it with my friends
Remember way back then?
I just had a normal job, I was workin' nine to five, tryna get them ends
Remember way back then?
I was tryna make a name, couldn't catch a brake, nobody would let me in
Remember way back then?
I remember back then...

[Verse 2]
It was just me and my cousin, we whipped it around the town
Nobody thought I would be the one to hold it down
Oh wow, now they approachin' me with a smile
Like, "I'm lovin' what you doin', let's kick it, it's been a while"
Nigga please, I'm seein' all of my enemies
Pretend to be a friend of me, they get up in the industry
Your energy is finicky and I don't need that shit
Fake love you can keep that shit, I repeat that shit
Fake love you can keep that shit
Got every girl tryna freak my dick and you can see I'm lit
You wouldn't be able to see I'm rich
Unless I showed you when them email hit and let you read that shit
I'm not the same as I used to be
I just ain't about nobody usin' me
And truthfully, you couldn't share the booth with me
Nigga, I ball, you can't hoop with me
