[Verse 1: Futuristic]
Ever since I was three years old, I been holding a microphone
Posing for the camera, with a fake chain and my Nikes on
And they said I had swagger before it was cool
All the pretty girls liked me, bro
I would talk to them all at the same time
Even though I had a wifey, though
We moved into the hood, now everybody trying to fight me, oh
Since I was all by myself, I never left my knife at home
I was raising my brother to grow up
And be the man that he's supposed to be
Actions speak louder than words
I was doing some things he was never suppose to see
Hopefully, he understands, that now everything has changed
Once I get a deal, his life ain't never gon' be the same
Never be the same, nah, nah, anything he want he could have it all
And if them kids say that he spoiled, that's okay, it'll be my fault
It's okay, it's okay, I just want him to have better
That smile all on his face, I want it to last forever
Imma keep grinding, cause in this game, Imma earn my stripes
Imma catch my flight, Imma get my hype
I been waiting for this moment, for all my life

[Hook: Jerrin Jaramillo]
All my life, I been working for all my life, now it's my time to shine
I been working for this, I been waiting for this
I been ready for this, I been dreaming for
All my life, I been working for all my life, now it's my time to shine
I been working for this, I been waiting for this
I been ready for this, I been dreaming for

[Verse 2: Futuristic]
I been dreaming for all my life, waiting on my one big break
Five hundred songs recorded, I go hard on every mixtape
A couple thousand albums sold, videos getting all the plays
I been working real hard for a minute
Now I think it's time for a raise
I remember the days when I would rap into a mic and you couldn't understand a word
Now I'm selling out shows and the fans telling me
I'm the very best that they heard
Growing up I was so smart, that the black kids said
Zach you're such a nerd
They tried to jump me, I told them that I ain't never scurred
And I can't even sleep
Cause I'm thinking 'bout everything that I'm trying to achieve
My momma told me I need education
But I already know what I'm trying to be
And you the one that told me that I just gotta believe
Get rich or die trying, I'mma succeed
And when I finally get that deal
You can say that your lil boy doing big things
I'm so mean, I'm so selfish, baby I can't help it
Constantly hard headed, like I'm always wearing a helmet
And you can't tell me, that this music isn't worth it
It's in my blood, in my circuits, I'm working cause this my purpose
Yeah

[Hook: Jerrin Jaramillo]
All my life, I been working for all my life, now it's my time to shine
I been working for this, I been waiting for this
I been ready for this, I been dreaming for
All my life, I been working for all my life, now it's my time to shine
I been working for this, I been waiting for this
I been ready for this, I been dreaming for

[Outro: Jerrin Jaramillo]
All my life, all my life, I been working for this
I been waiting for this, I been ready for this, I been dreaming for
All my life, all my life, I been working for this
I been waiting for this, I been ready for this, I been dreaming for
