[Intro]
You're all that matters to me, yeah, yeah

[Verse]
Yo, I think about you when I wake up
The last thing on my mind before I go to sleep
You heard my song said, "It was pretty deep"
Next thing we know, we under covers and I'm pretty deep
God damn, I got the type of shit that make you weak
After we finish you can barely speak, catch your breath
I bent you over the kitchen sink
I wrote this song as soon as you left
But it ain't about the sex though
It's a feeling I can't let go
A lotta letters you always end with an XO
A lotta fights, we a mess though
Screaming 'til my throat hurts like a nigga got strep throat
You the best at calming a nigga down
I feel lost when you're not around
I need a text or a call, I'm obsessed, I'm meant all
You the best that I saw, keep me on the ground
You feel lost in a shuffle, music is my hustle
I do it for the both of us so we ain't gotta struggle
You should know by now, I never put nothing above you
So now you better wear that dress I like you in or you in trouble
Matter fact, you in trouble either way
Pass the love, baby, lead the way
I fly you to the show tonight, you leave today
I think you already know what I don't need to say
You're all that matters to me

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, there ain't no "I" in team
I need you to believe that you're all that matters to me
You're all that matters to me
And I don't even sing, but I'm singing for you
Tryna get you in sheets and do things to you
What you think? We ain't leaving the room for a week or two
Fucking around, one take, download at onlyfuturistic.com
Or I'mma fuck your mom and your little sister nigga
Yeah and I'mma tell her, you're all that matters to me, yeah
