[Chorus: Fat Nick]
Pop it out, pop it out, pop it out
Pussy the pussy, anybody can pop it out
Skrrt it out, skrrt it out, skrrt it out
Tesla fresh offa' the line, they gon' skrrt it now
Pour it up, pour it up, pour it up
Drank got me leanin', can’t stop me from throwin' up
Air it out, air it out, air it out
Pull up, and smoke it up quick and then clear it out
Pop it out, pop it out, pop it out
Pussy the pussy, anybody can pop it out
Skrrt it out, skrrt it out, skrrt it out
Tesla for chauffeur in the lot, they gon' skrrt it now
Pour it up, pour it up, pour it up
Drug got me leanin', can’t stop me from throwin' up
Air it out, air it out, air it out
Pull up, and smoke it up quick and then clear it out

[Verse 1: Fat Nick]
Perkies stay callin'
Them oxys stay knockin'
Finessin' the pack and my rocket gon' pop it
Buffet Boys and $uicide
Turned up a homicide
Why you keep talking?
You know it's just do or die
Rollin' up, get popped by .44
Hollow works so you know ‘bout the kick though
Gettin' neck don’t care 'bout no hoe
Ten toes down
Just money over dumb hoes
Rover, I’m whippin’
My trapper stay tippin'
Codeine I be sippin'
Quit whinin' and bitchin'
The Gucci my linen
Buffet Boys, we winnin'
I’m duckin' these hoes—you can’t fuck with my pimpin'
Can’t phase me
I’m too hot
Got 2 Glocks
That pop shot
They too fat, I’m on that
My old bitch just had that

[Break: Gangsta Blac, ?, $lick $loth]
(Lil Remains) With da forty-five
With da forty (Lil Remains)
Turn it out ($carecrow)
With da forty-five (hey)
With da forty (hey)
Turn it out (hey)

[Verse 2: $lick $loth]
It's the grey
The five, the nine
Satan's arrive
Lucifer control my mind
Grip that .45
Lil Remains gon' make a stang
Shootin' up that Kurt Cobain
Come feel my pain
Cold in the rain
So say goodnight as I take the knife
Stick it and turn it as I watch your eyes get filled with fright
Oh lord
Oh lord
Please come and save me
Come avenge my life
So sorry bitch but god can't hear you
He is deaf tonight
Now watch me smite
Christ

[Break: Gangsta Blac, ?, Ruby da Cherry]
With da forty-five
With da forty
Turn it out
(line of coke) With da forty-five
With da forty (uh)
Turn it out (Oddy did a)

[Verse 3: Ruby da Cherry]
Oddy did a line of coke and killed the whole bag
Gram and a half
Smoke a sack
Smoke a pack
Now I got to sit down I don't know where I'm at, aye
Aye, po' me up a fucking cup
Found out that I just got dumped
I ain't feelin' very pumped
Ruby da cherry now Ruby da slump
Smoke up a blunt and then shrug
Ruby da bum gonna chug a whole script and then fuck up while fucking a bitch
What the fucks with my dick?
It ain't working I guess I'ma bounce
Swerve on back to the house
Killing myself with no lights, bitch, I died on the couch, huh

[Chorus: Fat Nick]
Pop it out, pop it out, pop it out
Pussy the pussy, anybody can pop it out
Skrrt it out, skrrt it out, skrrt it out
Tesla for chauffeur in the lot, they gon' skrrt it now
Pour it up, pour it up, pour it up
Drug got me leanin', can’t stop me from throwin' up
Air it out, air it out, air it out
Pull up, and smoke it up quick and then clear it out
Pop it out, pop it out, pop it out
Pussy the pussy, anybody can pop it out
Skrrt it out, skrrt it out, skrrt it out
Tesla for chauffeur in the lot, they gon' skrrt it now
Pour it up, pour it up, pour it up
Drug got me leanin', can’t stop me from throwin' up
Air it out, air it out, air it out
Pull up, and smoke it up quick and then clear it out
