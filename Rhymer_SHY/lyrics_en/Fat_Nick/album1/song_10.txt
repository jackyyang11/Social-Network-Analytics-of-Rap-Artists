[Hook]
I'm just blowing bands with my best friend
Designer matching, never wear the same shit
Pouring fours, yeah I'm feeling kinda dazed bitch
She don't even love me, she just want the clout, kid
I got a best friend now, VVS drip down
Raf Simons when I step
Got her buggin' all wild
I got a best friend now, VVS drip down
Raf Simons when I step
Got her buggin' all wild

[Verse 1]
All you bitches fake now
Get up out my face, hoe
He say he wan' beef me
Bitch, I gotta pipe B
22, I'm caked up
Gucci from the waist up
Grosso, bring the pints in
Shorty wanna bite me
Two cups, mud sprite
Bitch, I need me more pints
Metal fast, 'Rari's fast
Skrting out, run the gas
30 clip, load that shit
Step around, we dumping it
Designer down with the shits
Fuck that now, can't love no bitch

[Bridge]
Drugs, they be my best friend
Girl, you got me stressing
Can't you see I need you too?
Drugs, they be my best friend
Girl, you got me stressing
Can't you see I need you too?

[Hook]
I'm just blowing bands with my best friend
Designer matching, never wear the same shit
Pouring four behind feeling, kinda dangerous bitch
She don't even love me she just want the clout, kid
I got a best friend now, VVS drip down
Raf Simons when I step
Got her buggin' all wild
I got a best friend now, VVS drip down
Raf Simons when I step
Got her buggin' all wild

[Outro]
Drugs, they be my best friend
Girl, you got me stressing
Can't you see I need you too?
Drugs, they be my best friend
Girl, you got me stressing
Can't you see I need you too?
