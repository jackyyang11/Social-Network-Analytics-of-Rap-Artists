[Hook: Fat Nick]
Just my real homies still by me
None of the money excites me
All of these labels they watch me
Sobbing, on drugs, and they're cutting inside me
Just my real homies still by me
None of the money excites me
All of these labels they watch me
Sobbing, on drugs, and they're cutting inside me

[Verse 1]
I just need me more
More and more and more
Downers pick me up
Wake me up, yeah, fix me up
I never told her I loved her
Drinking my talking then told her I want her
Depression stay hiding in me
Drownin' in drugs I just need it to sleep
All we just wanted was bands
Bands and kill myself fans
All I just wanted was hoes
Gettin’ these hoes man to stay on my toes
Syrup just kept me alive
Talkin' 'bout thinkin' like when I’m gon' die
I dreamed of Giuseppes and Trues
I jump in the pit and go buy them brand new
Now I stay flexin' this shit
Pop out the cut
Skrrtin’ foreigns you bitch
I'm making money with friends
Buffet or die, yeah, I'm here 'till the end
People ain't liked it before
These blogs they know it for sho'
Clamp from the bottom the boat
Now I got paper they all wanna know
Drinkin' surpressed me
If I stay sober my life gon' undress me
Why do I do this to me?
Sippin’ on codeine
I’m prayin' to sleep
Now I got money on money
Why everybody gon’ talk to me funny
Drinkin’ took over my body
Blockin’ out feelings I don’t need me nobody
$uicideboy$, they my bros
Ro’ done calling me G.O.A.T
Lil Krez, he finessed a few bands
Germ, he gave me a plan
Mikey, I love him to death
I swear, I just love him to death
Pouya my brother on God
Been all together
Fuck having a job

[Hook]
Just my real homies still by me
None of that money excites me
All of these labels they watch me
Sobbing, on drugs, and they're cutting inside me
Just my real homies still by me
None of the money excites me
All of these labels they watch me
Sobbing, on drugs, and they're cutting inside me
