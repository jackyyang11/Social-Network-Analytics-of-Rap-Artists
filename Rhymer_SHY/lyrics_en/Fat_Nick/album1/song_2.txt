[Hook x2]
I fell in love with a drink
I fell in love with a trap
I fell in love with a benz
I fell, I fell in love with a grams
I fell in love with a, we fell in love with a [x2]

[Verse 1: Fat Nick]
All these bitches need me now
All these labels feel me now
Hollow shots gon' make him drop
Your bitches love me cus Im hot
I just drank another pint
I just want another [?]
Please don't love me you'll get hurt

Rollin', pourin', your beat keep going
Activist keep coming [?] im flowin'

All my bitches models wow

Designer dream Im sipping lean
Bitch, bitch don't come my way

Go pop these pills and come my way
Buffet boys the shit boy you know we on top
Countin' the money, can't fuck with no ops
Catch you straight lackin', I know you ain't sharp
