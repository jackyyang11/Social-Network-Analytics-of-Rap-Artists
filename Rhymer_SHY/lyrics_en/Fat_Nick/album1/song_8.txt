[Intro: Mikey The Magician]
MTM hit em' with the heat!

[Chorus: Fat Nick]
I got bags on me
Percs, lean, what you need?
Went and flooded out my teeth
Rich and handsome, look at me
Fifteen for the show
Twenty for my chain
Thirty and the pistol
And these bullets got no name
I got bags on me
Percs, lean, what you need?
Went and flooded out my teeth
Rich and handsome, look at me
Fifteen for the show
Twenty for my chain
Thirty and the pistol
And these bullets got no name

[Verse 1]
I don't blow no dope
I smoke these crumbs up on the porch
A hundred in my drum and it gon' burst out one gun
These Xans and lean is fun
You sip stupid weenie hoe, what's up?
I can't do no boxing, keep this .30 by my gut
Oh shit, what's up?
Fucked up, don't cum
I'm to tired, look at me
Why your crackhead texting me?
Oh yes, slowing now
All these xans, they calm me down
Bitch I'm 'bout it, yeah I'm 'bout in
In your city poppin' off

[Verse 2]
I don't need my old bitch
She a dumb bitch
I got money on me now
Yeah, I'm dumb rich
Just a trap mule
Watch this drop view
Shorty bent my line but tell what that mouth do

[Chorus: Fat Nick]
I got bags on me
Percs, lean, what you need?
Went and flooded out my teeth
Rich and handsome, look at me
Fifteen for the show
Twenty for my chain
Thirty and the pistol
And these bullets got no name
I got bags on me
Percs, lean, what you need?
Went and flooded out my teeth
Rich and handsome, look at me
Fifteen for the show
Twenty for my chain
Thirty and the pistol
And these bullets got no name
