[Intro: Mikey The Magician]
MTM, hit 'em with the heat!

[Chorus: Fat Nick]
We keep running up a bag, yeah yeah
Diamonds dancing on my neck all night
Bentley truck swerving, hell yeah
I just popped another bag, yeah yeah
We keep running up a bag, yeah yeah
Diamonds dancing on my neck all night
Bentley truck swerving, hell yeah
I just popped another bag, yeah yeah

[Verse 1: Fat Nick]
Got a bag yeah, baby wanna fuck me
You can run it up, watch me hit the 16
Movin' too fast, zoomin' in the M3
All this water on my shining, walking Louis V
Two cups stuffed, let's just get fucked up
All the stars bright, baby look at this ice
Let's fuck, keep it going, yeah, all night
And I can't even feel my face so shit yikes

[Pre-Chorus: Fat Nick]
Now I gotta go, you kick me out the door
You getting on the stuff, 'cause you feeling all alone
Now I gotta go, you kick me out the door
You getting on the stuff, 'cause you feeling all alone

[Chorus: Fat Nick]
We keep running up a bag, yeah, yeah
Diamonds dancing on my neck all night
Bentley truck swerving, hell yeah
I just popped another bag, yeah, yeah
We keep running up a bag, yeah, yeah
Diamonds dancing on my neck all night
Bentley truck swerving, hell yeah
I just popped another bag, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Fat Nick]
Big Benz hit the gas, bae, let's go
And if you wanna bring your friends, I got a Range Rove'
I done witness fumes, and baby, we want all the smoke
I know you see my diamonds jumping, you already know
All my cuts real low, I need more ice
More ice, more Sprites, let's take flight
I already know, yeah, we got the feeling right
And if you with the shits, you can stay all night

[Pre-Chorus: Fat Nick]
Now I gotta go, you kick me out the door
You getting on the stuff, 'cause you feeling all alone
Now I gotta go, you kick me out the door
You getting on the stuff, 'cause you feeling all alone

[Chorus: Fat Nick]
We keep running up a bag, yeah, yeah
Diamonds dancing on my neck all night
Bentley truck swerving, hell yeah
I just popped another bag, yeah, yeah
We keep running up a bag, yeah, yeah
Diamonds dancing on my neck all night
Bentley truck swerving, hell yeah
I just popped another bag, yeah, yeah
