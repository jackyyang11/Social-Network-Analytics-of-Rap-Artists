[Verse 1: [?]]
Man it's just another Tennessee day
So I call my baby say I'm on my way
Then hit up the boys, tell 'em meet me in the mud
Bring a few jars of shine and a couple bags of bud
We're livin' it up, yeah tonight it's goin' down
Couple cases of long necks and plenty Apple Crown
We gather around the bonfire let our troubles escape
And we gon' have a good time man whatever it takes
I got the grill loaded up baby backs been smoked
This barbecue is hard to do man and that's no joke
I'm talkin' fall right off the bone finger lickin' while you're kickin' it
We gon' keep the party live and make sure that you remember it
Smell of good pine as well as some good shine
Intertwined with my kind one hell of a good time
Yeah, when we get there we gon' pop a few tops
Put your favorite song on and let the tailgate drop, come on

[Chorus]
Hop your little self in my big ol' truck
Roll the windows down get your hair messed up
Sling a little mud on a Saturday afternoon
Pop a few tops let the tailgate drop
Call all our friends the party won't stop
Crank up the radio and play your favorite tune
We got all afternoon

[Verse 2: [?]]
A nice breeze on a summer's eve
Sets the mood right into the moon light
We turn up until the sun goes down
Let us show you how a small town throws down
It ain't hard to do good people lots of food
Everything deep fried or barbecued mmm hmm
And anything you can think of to drink up
Now raise your drinks up, yeah raise your drinks up
And have a toast to the ones who are here to party
Little drinkin' little smokin' ain't hurtin' nobody
But look at her body movin' in that sun dress
Drinkin' Miller Lite pretty as the sun sets
And by sun set better get her info
Tell her hop in the truck and roll down the windows
Music up slingin' mud as we drive away
And prolly do the same thing next Saturday

[Chorus]
Hop your little self in my big ol' truck
Roll the windows down get your hair messed up
Sling a little mud on a Saturday afternoon
Pop a few tops let the tailgate drop
Call all our friends the party won't stop
Crank up the radio and play your favorite tune
We got all afternoon

Hop your little self in my big ol' truck
Roll the windows down get your hair messed up
Sling a little mud on a Saturday afternoon
Pop a few tops let the tailgate drop
Call all our friends the party won't stop
Crank up the radio and play your favorite tune
We got all afternoon

Hop your little self in my big ol' truck
Roll the windows down get your hair messed up
Sling a little mud on a Saturday afternoon
We got nothin' but time baby
Pop a few tops let the tailgate drop
Call all our friends the party won't stop
Crank up the radio and play your favorite tune
We got all afternoon
