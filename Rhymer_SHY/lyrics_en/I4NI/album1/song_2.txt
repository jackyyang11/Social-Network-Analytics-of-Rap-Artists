[Chorus]
She's a field full of fire flies sitting by the river
As the suns going down its a moment to remember
I love everything about her man she's out side
Looking like a rock star with the aviators on
Jammin' her favorite song all night long
Her and Janis Joplin singing Bobby Mcgee
Into a hair brush microphone drowning out the radio
When she talks I just listen
There's not a thing about her I don't want to be missing tonight
Missing tonight yeah
She's my kind of right
She's my kind of right

[Verse 1: Colt Ford]
Another moon lit night firefly light
Back road beauty got me feeling just right
I'm fishing in the dark for a strawberry kiss
Been dreaming of her and me and a night like this
Got me all turned up I'm talking redneck crazy
Lord thank you for making country girls so amazing
She's all I wanted loved her 'fore I ever met her
Smile like sunshine making my world better

[Chorus]
She's a field full of fire flies sitting by the river
As the suns going down its a moment to remember
I love everything about her man she's out side
Looking like a rock star with the aviators on
Jammin' her favorite song all night long
Her and Janis Joplin singing Bobby Mcgee
Into a hair brush microphone drowning out the radio
When she talks I just listen
There's not a thing about her I don't want to be missing tonight
Missing tonight yeah
She's my kind of right
She's my kind of right

[Verse 2]
A southern girl with a pony tail and daisy dukes
All American from her hat down to her boots
She's pretty cute and the way she moves looks even better
Never forget the day and the way that I met her
So sentimental when talkin' and starin' at her dimples
You make my heart skip a beat baby plain and simple
And I'd of never thought that she would be mine
Got me thankin' god one more time

[Chorus]
She's a field full of fire flies sitting by the river
As the suns going down its a moment to remember
I love everything about her man she's out side
Looking like a rock star with the aviators on
Jammin' her favorite song all night long
Her and Janis Joplin singing Bobby Mcgee
Into a hair brush microphone drowning out the radio
When she talks I just listen
There's not a thing about her I don't want to be missing tonight
Missing tonight yeah
She's my kind of right
She's my kind of right
She's my kind of right
She's my kind of right

[Bridge]
I'm a sucker for that little smile on her face
There's not a thing about her that I would ever change
And every day and every way
She has my heart and that's where it will stay

[Chorus]
She's a field full of fire flies sitting by the river
As the suns going down its a moment to remember
I love everything about her man she's out side
Looking like a rock star with the aviators on
Jammin' her favorite song all night long
Her and Janis Joplin singing Bobby Mcgee
Into a hair brush microphone drowning out the radio
When she talks I just listen
There's not a thing about her I don't want to be missing tonight
Missing tonight yeah
She's my kind of right
She's my kind of right
She's my kind of right
She's my kind of right
