[Verse: Matisyahu]

Here I come
Main line
Maintain
Super brain
Crushed grapes
From the vine
Searching for the signs
Like rolling thunder and the days
When I'd ponder puff clouds over yonder magic dragon in the sky

[Chorus: Matisyahu]

Two eyes
Double rainbow
Fly in the sky
Doves cry when I blaze through the night
Two eyes
Double rainbow
Sly in the sky
Doves cry when I blaze through the night
Babylon falling
Blaze through the night
Babylon is burning

[Verse 2: Matisyahu]

Same city
Same drone
Scenery change but my zone stays unknown
You were with me but now I'm not in control
Fold crash and crumble
I decompose
And run back to the grass
Back to the last moment intact
In a flash it'll be over
And we'll be back

[Brigde:Matisyahu]

Winter rain time
Suns down streets are cold
I sold the last possession
I am all alone

[Chorus: Matisyahu]

Two eyes
Double rainbow
Sly in the sky
Doves cry when I blaze through the night
Two eyes
Double rainbow
Sly in the sky
Doves cry when I blaze through the night
Babylon falling
Blaze through the night
Babylon is burning

[Verse 3: Matisyahu]

Black heart
Twist and turned
Where the wild wind sings
Where the whirlwind burns
Where the madness rings in the
Crisp night sky
Where the air might sting and bring the reasons why
Ancient child
I swim the Nile
With my rude boy style the wild child
I get lost for a while when I'm under attack I took my freedom back and took the path unmapped

[Chorus: Matisyahu]
Two eyes
Double rainbow
Sly in the sky
Doves cry when I blaze through the night
Two eyes
Double rainbow
Sly in the sky
Doves cry when I blaze through the night
Babylon falling
Blaze through the night
Babylon is burning

[Verse 4: Matisyahu]
One day I might make it up I might
Get it right
When I rise like the moonlight
Zoom in thru the
Moonroof tops and night light
The room glows when my minds right
So make room to take flight
We fly right
Up up and away we go
The rainbows about to blow
When i go Hans solo
Frozen in slow mo
Reference of the airflow
Remember ancient days with no clothes
Open doors to where freedom grows
And this man knows no no's just yes
Feelin blessed in this city that's depressed I jest not
Them get old sink and rot
Colder then frost
At all cost
I toss and turn
While the kingdom burns
I yearn for freedom
From the demons we see them
Return the land of redemption
Tell ya henchmen we sent them
Into trenches hence my invention
Of a plan apprehension
I'm lendin my soul for this
While many men search for bliss
I see the vision its my interest
Intellect can only take you so far
Intuition is the way to live stars
Rid them from the lids we stay open
Cast my line into the ocean and come up for air when I'm floating
Through the clouds an explosion
So rain down on the creation
