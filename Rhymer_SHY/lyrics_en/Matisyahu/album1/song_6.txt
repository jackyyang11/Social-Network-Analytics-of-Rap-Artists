All of my enemies, they surround me
But I will chop them down
Encompass me, but in the name of the Lord
I will cut them down
They push me, they want me to fall
With my back against the wall
My back against the wall

I shall not die
I shall live in the land of the living
I shall not die
I will live in the land of the living

Shooting stars, burning sky, rising with the dawn
Ground is hard, angels cry, son we must move on
Teach me to love
Where are you, o my son, where are you
Ayeka, Ayeka, Ayeka
Teach me to love

They say man is the lamp of God
Well I'm your fog lights in this journey
Through the smog so write it in the logs
And all the blogs and the streets, write it with your feet
When you walk and you talk through the concrete speak
Spark seek 'til the end of days
Through all the crazy states I'm amazed
Now let the children "rage"

I shall not die, look into your eyes
And I realize that all I know is gone

Shooting stars, burning sky, rising with the dawn
Ground is hard, angels cry, son we must move on
Teach me to love
Where are you, o my son, where are you
Ayeka, Ayeka, Ayeka
Teach me to love, teach me to love
Teach me to love, teach me to love
Teach me to love
Where are you, o my son, where are you
Ayeka, Ayeka, Ayeka
Teach me

Take your blade, rising sun, burns and fades, three long days
Is this your way, here you are, and here I am

Shooting stars, burning sky, rising with the dawn
Ground is hard, angels cry, son we must move on
Teach me to love
Where are you, o my son, where are you
Ayeka, Ayeka, Ayeka
Teach me to love, teach me to love
Teach me to love, teach me to love
Teach me to love
Where are you, o my son, where are you
Ayeka, Ayeka, Ayeka
Teach me
