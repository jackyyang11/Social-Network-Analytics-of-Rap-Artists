Yo, yeah
Y'all ready to get hyped?
Austin how you all feeling
Like this, Like this
It's the music that grows all the illusion and fears
It's the music that makes the confusion become clear
It's the music that I live, for 18 years
It's the music I give my blood, sweat, and tears
Not to mention some lifer
Did I mention I like her?
Then the rest of the cipher man it's not hard to decipher
Music gets people hyper
Music made me a writer
Music made me a fighter
Yo man, pass me the lighter
It's the fire ignitor shinning right into the sky
Look me right in the eye
Hey yo kid, you want to fly
The why-o, the n-ya, from N.Y. to egg white
You cannot deny so why even try
My mother sang songs to kids in consentration
His mother sang songs inside the cotton plantation
Her mother sang songs while we were robbin' the nation
Now I sing songs for much more then an occupation
I am the music
We are the music
I am the music
You are the music
Austin is the music
Texas is the music
We are the mu-sic
Yo I take two steps forward
Taking one step back
Every time I think I'm on track, the lights fade to black
Now I pick the slack and attack faster then a raptor on crack
Feel my knack and just spit
I bet there's more triplets cuz rap has hit vicious
My style is more delicious the eggnog
You wish this kid would vanish, souls is famished
And my spirit needs fitness, that why I flip this
Yo so I held back the life and blown and feeling
Alright surprising people cuz I drowned last night
Here I am one more time
My rhyme are at your shine
I'm ripping over rhythms life swimming through time
Sit back in unwind
Let your brain unravel
Slip sliding away like travelin on wet gravel
Ain't no need to battle if knee P ya
