In the beginning of time
Before the mountains were made
Before the sky split
HaShem sits
In peace and harmony
Creates the space for a new baby
We stay empty in the vision of a king
For his dream to manifest in we
Princes and priests will become
Run and emerge as the surge flows like rain

To see it, to see the day to come
When the king will look into his kingdom
Into my being, and see his self happy
Believe in me- I believe in we

This is the story of the seven beggars
Trying to get back on an eagle's feathers
Looking for a place to be born
Amongst the sons and daughters
To get back to you, get back to you

There was an ocean
And there was a boat
It ran into the waves and the rocks and it broke
From the debris
Was made the ocean and sky
Over the sea lies the ancient smile
So the great eagle smiles
You, you, me, we are the same
You, who remembers all the while
All the way back before the cord was cut

Before the leaves
Before the trees
Before the seas
And the black ocean breeze
Before the great storm
Wandering in this world
Waiting for a day to be born

This is the story of the seven beggars
Trying to get back on an eagle's feathers
Looking for a place to be born
Amongst the sons and daughters
Get back to you, get back to you

And you try to fill yourself up with all this stuff
To fill the hole; I'm trying to FEEL the hole
No reason to talk if you ain't got what to say
And besides, everything is okay
You know that place where you'd run away?
Well it's time to stay
Time to be hungry
Before the beginning
Before this song
Before right and wrong
Before Adam and Eve
Above space and time
Above reason and rhyme
Above circles and lines
Before the clock start tickin'
We were lost at sea (in the boat)
Waves crash around me (fire and stone)

This is the story of the seven beggars
Trying to get home on an eagle's feathers
Looking for a place to be born
Amongst the sons and daughters
Get back to you, Get back now, and get it back
Go on and get it back
