The place lays phased like a warrior slayed
Engraved into the space with his sword still raised
Layers of charcoal sprayed through hallways
Praise relays off the walls echoin' always
Dirt covered earth lays beneath my rib cage
Givin' birth to overgrowth invadin' on to path ways
Burnt out trees cover streets where children once played
Sown seeds decay through sacred steppin' stones in disarray
Where the alter used to be placed
Interchanged for bloodstains
Sunrays illuminate smoke filled haze
Trace of incense, scents of sacrifice stayed
Aish Tamid eternally, fire burns continuously
Wondering where you've been, won't you come on home to me?
Aish Tamid eternally, a fire burns continuously
Wondering where you've been, won't you, won't you come to me?
Flashback, patches of grass growin' wild in fact
Cracked walls burnt black like a kingdom sacked
Memories like artifacts attacked yet still intact
Melodies wrapped in glass shatter with the impact
Air interminglin', ringin' with the singin'
Of songs once sung, flung, hung into the rafters
Catastrophe struck, the sound stuck, disaster plastered
The aftermath a blasted buildin' still standin'
Like a starved man fasting the skies expandin'
Clouds passin', dust particles dancin' in broken bars of light
Streamin' from a shaft slashed into the ceilin'
Shh, you could feel the ground breathin'
Aish Tamid eternally, fire burns continuously
Wondering where you've been, won't you come on home to me?
Aish Tamid eternally, a fire burns continuously
Wondering where you've been, won't you, won't you come to me?
Daughter of Zion is lyin' cryin' in the mist
Mornin' light slips in siftin' through the darkness
Like a mornin' wife reminisce
Having visions of her long gone prince
Memory drips, rain drops tip
Towin' emptiness
Intermixed with tears
Like fears left unfixed
Walls worn thin, frozen fortress
Like dawn waitin' for a day that got skipped
Like a life gone wrong wanderin' wilderness
Lovesick stripped abyss [Incomprehensible] once luscious
Aish Tamid eternally, fire burns continuously
Wondering where you've been, won't you come on home to me?
Aish Tamid eternally, a fire burns continuously
Wondering where you've been, won't you, won't you come to me?
Paint the scene, so you can see city pickin' up speed
On a bench 14th street, taxis streamin' yellow streaks
Spears piercing through my ears, you could hear the traffic speak
Jack hammers drill smackin' through the sizzling concrete
Windowsills spilling tangled telephone wires
Signs sparking neon lights flashin' like wildfire
My insides rise, I start to feel paralyzed
Let out a sigh, a melody blew by like an ancient war cry
Sunlight hit the trees, it really caught my eye
Glistenin', listenin' to the breeze
Dancin' through the trees, freeze
The city goes in slow motion like a dream
I'm left empty like a temple turned into a fox den
Bus fumes drippin', spittin' into city summer sun
Siftin' through the ash
Dimly lit vision listenin'
To the hiss liftin' off a nighttime ocean
Shim, shim, shimmerin', singein' hair on my skin
Whispering where ya been?
Glim, glim, glimmerin'
From amidst the darkness set sail with the softness
Breeze travelin' across the seas arisen from within Mt. Zion
Wind comin' in, pickin' up momentum
Cuttin' crisply through the darkness ridin' on a rhythm
A rollercoaster sizzlin'
Twistin' down the mountain
Rippin' rocket ship explodin' like a fountain
Overflowin', spillin' through the courtyard of Jerusalem
Uncoverin' debris, liftin' up the fallen arisen within'
To reach the yiddin
Even in Manhattan, exposed Menorah
Glowin' in the shadows of destruction
Trailblazin' through affliction
Brushin' off the branches
Golden standin' strong, flames dancin'
Like a lion roarin', risin' out of nothin'
