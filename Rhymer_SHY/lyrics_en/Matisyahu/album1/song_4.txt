How can I talk to you
I step into your glory
I step into the house
House of David's light

How can I talk to you
It's the same story
Ashrey yoshvey beyseho
Teach me to love, teach me to love

Avraham, Avraham
Take your son, take your blade, take your rope
Three long nights, three long days
And approach to the mountain of the Lord
Yes you've been here times before
In your dreams, fantasies, realities, they all bleed

Ayeka
Teach me to love
Ayeka

Avraham, Avraham
Take your son, take your blade, take your rope
Three long nights, three long days
And approach to the mountain of the Lord
Yes you've been here times before
In your dreams, your fantasies, realities, yea they all bleed

Teach me to love
Ayeka
