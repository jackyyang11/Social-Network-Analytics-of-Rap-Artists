On the day when a man was born, hop from one world to another
I don’t know who you are, even when we face each other
When I wake up I know you’re here, this is everything that you’ve done
I’ve got nothing to fear, because the battles already been won

(Chorus)
This is the time of divine favor
Sublime love cuts, like a razor
Burning up our fear and pain
Ascending fire like a laser beam

This is the time of divine favor
Sublime love cuts, like a razor
Burning up our fear and pain
Ascending fire like a laser beam

Search heavens and the seven seas
The answer lies inside you
You know it won’t come easy
You’ve got to find your own truth

When I returned to the lower garden I saw many souls living and dead
Rushing back and forth ascending from one world to the next
The joy was too great for our ears to hear or for words to express
All were bein forgiven for stolen time and debts

Asked me to come with them, cause of the glory of your contemplation
You’ve been given eyes to see, looking for a prophet to accompany me
But alone I must go on my own, flyin with my very own set of wings
I reached the highest heights, knocking on the door of the king of kings

(Chorus)
This is the time of divine favor
Sublime love cuts, like a razor
Burning up our fear and pain
Ascending fire like a laser beam

This is the time of divine favor
Sublime love cuts, like a razor
Burning up our fear and pain
Ascending fire like a laser beam

Search heavens and the seven seas
The answer lies inside you
You know it won’t come easy
You’ve got to find your own truth

(Verse/Outro)
It’s your life to live; I can’t live it for you
It’s your time to give and I can’t give it for you
It’s your fear to lose; I can’t lose it for you
Death or life so choose and I put both before you

So, find your word of truth
You’ve got to find your word of truth

It’s your life to live; I can’t live it for you
It’s your time to give and I can’t give it for you

Search heavens and the seven seas
The answer lies inside you
You know it won’t come easy
You’ve got to find your own truth
