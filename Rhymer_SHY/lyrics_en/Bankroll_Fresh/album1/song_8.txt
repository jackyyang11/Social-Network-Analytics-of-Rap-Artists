Dough boy sees cocaine
Wash away my pain with champagne

Bankroll hundred don’t never change
Change in the rearview
Lane change won’t switch your lane
Post it up n*gga we dose lane
Switch it for the propane
Like ESPN, I got game
Hit the bullseye I got aim
Despite on half how your flame add up
Additional change
Bad bitch in Vera Wang

It’s the plane game
Playing polo team
Fly dinner talking parakeet
Bitch is fresher than potpourri
Imported Gucci from overseas
Couple bad bitches we imported these

But no heart like Michael Jordan
Number 7 Jordan number one I’m sportin
You n*gga licker
You n*gga can’t let you one leaving the pacer
Driving foreign cars to be a racer
Sport breaker sport biker

Stunt harder
With the bird game like I’m from Harlem
New Wilson we propose charger
I know your man, I’m still charging him
Boss em up, I’m something to see
Everything come with a fee
Champions don’t face the fee

Street money n*gga we is discreet

[Chorus:]
