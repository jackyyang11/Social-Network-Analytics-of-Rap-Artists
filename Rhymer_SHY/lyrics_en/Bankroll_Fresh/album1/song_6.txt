[Intro: Bankroll Fresh]
See where I'm from, this shit go on everyday
Atlanta, Georgia, Zone 3, Pittsburgh
Home of the hustlers

[Intro: Bankroll Pj]
Street Money worldwide, Oh You know it!

[Chorus: Bankroll Fresh]
We at the trap house behind the fence
Do it for my trap niggas represent
Real trap nigga drop it then mix
Do it for my trap niggas, fuck a bitch (Fuck that bitch!)
Bounce yo ass shawty, do a split
All the trap niggas juggin off the splits
All the trap niggas juggin off the bricks
Real trap nigga playing off the sticks

[Verse 1: Bankroll Fresh]
I'm running through this shit, I'm talking marathon
Nigga bring your cash, I'm even counting one's
Have you ever bought it, Would you ever sell it
Have you ever wrapped it, Would you ever mail it
And I'm in that motherfucker, Looking like it
Nigga I'm ballin like the 93 tyson (2x)
Dope boy swag, Dope man pockets
Yamaha sport biker (Switch it up!)
Iont want her nigga, Iont like her
Iont like her I just one night her
She calling you, You broke her phone, fight her
And I'm lookin like a drug lord
Eatin with the fucking thug boys
In here looking like a real mob
Pull up on yo ass, Fuck boy

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Bankroll Fresh]
Gotta call my man back to hit the raw
Say he ready, say he really want the log [?]
When you get here nigga, Come and buy a whole
When you on your way, better watch for State patrol
Camera on the spot and [?] gold
[?]
[?]
Now I use the microwave to kill the stove
Nigga pay me what you owe
Nigga come in here with mo'
Have the correct amount nigga
Yo pussy ass better count quicker
Trapper use the vacuum sealer
Ain't no niggas in the middle
Thumb through the money counter
Rubber bands wrapped around it

[Chorus]

[End]
