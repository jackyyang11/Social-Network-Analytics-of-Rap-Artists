[Chorus:]
Left the dope in the pot did a 360
Left the dealership the Beamer did a 360
In the following day shift I got me three bitches
Zone three nigga, yeah you know the three with me
Left the dope in the pot did a 360
Left the dealership the Beamer did a 360
Zone three nigga, yeah you know the three with me

[Verse 1:]
Turning out the dealership I damn near hit a car
Fresh as fuck got Louis on me yeah all on my scarf
Spent a ten on my earrings and fucking lost one
Two hunned for the pussy baby you don’t cost none
Tell my nigga Fuzzy hit me with my cross done
Hit you with that carbon fuck around your car spun
Three bitches touching toes
I just came from bussin O's
That’s the spot I’m working four's
Nigga trying to gigolo
Money counting through the doors backwards
Spent a ten down in patchwork ask kirk
Droppin circles nigga nigga jugg that work
Shawty work the stick Fuck around get murked

[Chorus]
Left the dope in the pot did a 360
Left the dealership the Beamer did a 360
In the following day shift I got me three bitches
Zone three nigga, yeah you know the three with me
Left the dope in the pot did a 360
Left the dealership the Beamer did a 360
Zone three nigga, yeah you know the three with me

[Verse 2:]
Bad bitches at the Doubletree MC suite
And I got me two three bitches yeah they trying to freak freak
Bitch you freaking like a freak nine to five
Pull up with them forgio's with the king size
Oops don’t do it

No I ain't it put it in her butt but she's a slut
She wanted to do that shit but I put her out the truck
Young nigga got real money Street money and I keep coming
Keep money coming every day

I got the Glock with the beam on it right now nigga who want it

[Chorus]
