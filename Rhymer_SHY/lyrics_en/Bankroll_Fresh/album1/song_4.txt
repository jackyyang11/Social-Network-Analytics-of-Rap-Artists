[Verse 1]
New Bentley bout to drop, i want two of 'em nigga
Walked out the Lenox mall with a blue on nigga
Back, back, back to back, i bought two of em' nigga
Nigga say he cashing out, buy a few of em' nigga
Racks getting bigger, bigger & bigger
Playing with the rock nigga feeling like jigga
Fresh as fuck nigga dont i look like a dealer
Looking at you nigga, nigga you look like a snitcher
Just got off the plane went straight to my sprinter
Red Christian Louboutin went straight to the dinner
Fresh from off a jugg went straight to the dealer
Nigga we hand to hand ain't no man in the middle

[Hook 2x]
Ballin' hard on these bitches i ain't playin' with these niggas
I ain't playin' with these niggas
Ballin' hard on these bitches i ain't sparin' no nigga
I ain't sparin' no nigga

[Verse 2]
Black benz, black vett, black lexus, black rover with the feet
Black chavelle, Black jeep
Black honda low-key, New honda no key
Push start white seats, Louis Vuitton a whole G'
Warner gotti with the beat, Red Rari' red feet
Polo sport on my tee, High as i can fuckin' be
20 thousand in my pocket, nigga that ain't nothin' to me
Let me by on the case, nigga that ain't nothin' to beat
All my niggas screamin' street, all yall pussy niggas weak
Motor soundin' like a beast, Hear it hummin' up the street
Went to Calcoun for a week, Finessed your man cause he was sweet
Shinin' hard i let em' see, Ballin' fresh straight out the street

[Hook2x]
Ballin' hard on these bitches i ain't playin' with these niggas
I anit playin' with these niggas
Ballin' hard on these bitches i ain't sparin' no nigga
I ain't sparin' no nigga
