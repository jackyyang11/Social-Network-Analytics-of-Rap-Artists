[Verse 1]
Got a trap spot, put the pot in it
Got a new watch with them rocks in it
Got a condo with a fox in it
Crib got a lake, put a yacht in it
Whip back to back, car lot in it
Got an AR, 50 shots in it
Got a SS, a big block in it
Might spin thru and hit your block in it
Whip the steering wheel with the knock in it
Car talk back, a robot in it
Don’t you hit me nigga ‘less it’s ‘bout business
Me and two bitches, Marriott in it
Monster truck, nigga sit on your side
Spent ten thousand, kit and 4 tires
Pussy nigga tryna play both sides
Fuck around get you and that nigga hogtied
Move in silence nigga Mob Ties
Try one of us and then we all ride
Big MAC for you small fries
Bankroll loaded, loaded super size
My dashboard a computer size
Im with a bitch who got the cutest eyes
Louis Vuitton on my book bag
Ran off, yeah we took that

[Hook]
Came through, Alpina Beamer
Got my eyes on a Lamborghini
Maserati with low mileage
Triple black on the new Audi
200 thousand in the public housing
Poppin’, Ace of Spades, spending thousands
You in my lane, get the fuck out it
You in my lane, get the fuck out it
