[intro: Oswin Benjamin]
Don't stress let them label you, just do what have to do
Remember it's never what they call you, it's what you answer to
Don't let your words do more speaking than your actions do
And when you point a finger, 3's pointing back at you
With your attitude
Pave the way for those after you
Be certain in your purpose, spread love to the hopeless, Jehovah
Know this is potent man
400 bifocals couldn't give me more focus man
The bro's try to disguise as locus man, but I beat that play
Turn that page
So fuck you and your feelings
Break through the stain glass, and your glass ceilings [?] [?]

[Verse: Oswin Benjamin]
Hold up, nigga's caught in they feelings, [?] me with your opinions
And they ain't even got the answers Sway
I'm a hybrid of Cornell and Kanye
A warrior just trying to find euphoria
With love and hate colliding inside of emporiums
My soul is searching
Hearts in rehab, Love sedation cause me to relapse
Too many feelings for me to be lost in
Too many feelings for blank statements
