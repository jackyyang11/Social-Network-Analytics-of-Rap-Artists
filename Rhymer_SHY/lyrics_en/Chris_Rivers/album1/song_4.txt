[Verse 1: Chris Rivers]
Woe is me and yes you left my heart in pain
Frozen overflowing oceans now just clog my brain
Drowning in the thought that we will never be the same
You chose the potion over family, for that I'm so ashamed
This honey elixir is thicker than blood you figure
Brothers mothers sisters run thinner inside your liver
Me as your father bothered the farther you go it's harder to harbor these waves get
Larger for starters said fuck this picture
Fucking quitter
You realize all the things you had in store?!
You once had dreams like that of kings but you gave up queens to love a whore
But now your poor knocking on the door to kingdoms unexplored
Your future was so golden like Midas tried and write your final score
I watched you grow from chromosomes to bones and traits of human beings
But this honey in your soul has grown and now it pulls the strings
And of course we want to see you high but these drugs are foolish wings
So when your crashing from the sky just know we love you when we sing sing

[Verse 2: Chris Rivers]
You left my heart in pain
Hanged through the darkest rain
Drained through the largest veins
Change was the hardest thing
And these endorphins pumped inside are dormant hiding all my torment
Engaged to new bad habits now that seem to need divorcing
Like a headless Horseman cause my hearts asleep and hollow
Need to burrow sorrow mine will stretch indefinite like no tomorrow
And though it's vital
Can't answer things like "who's your idol"
Life has got me suicidal need distractions for survival
They say I should read the Bible
But no I'm taking needles, getting higher than an eagle
So I stand with God as equals, without the honey I feel feeble
That's why I'm getting high
And I would hide inside the sky, because to dive would be with people
And all they did was judge me claiming that they fucking loved me
But if they did, then why persist in tryna take me from my honey?
But now my lovely's just a memory
Flew too high and burnt my feathered wings
So when I crash upon the mezzanine
Don't laugh just nod your head and sing

[Verse 3: Chris Rivers]
For me subconsciously it's hard to be so nonchalant and hardening
Cause part of me is arguing with other parts thats pondering
Quite the paradox or not but rather an anomaly
I'm passed the heart break I'm just repairing all my arteries
Preparing for a war between better judgement and whores
Walking the tight rope between fine loving and gore
Teetering on the edge between lost hopes and door that connects to
The rest of the last dreams scenes that I've adored
I gave you all I could and you're still asking for more
If I could stretch out to infinity you still wouldn't be sure
And we all should draw a line, but yours wasn't defined
So through the pain I couldn't find time to escape all your allure
They're emotionally poor tho' quick to claim riches
Honey coated lines and lies from fake bitches
And I don't like the lime or light so take pictures
On your own accord but just know that I ain't with ya
I ain't with ya, drink fire the flame spitter need pain killers
From all of these tiger like fang kissers, so hang Rivers
And while he's gasping for his breath
Know he gave you everything so death is really all that's left yes
