Intro:
(Distorted)
Wait, where am I
I can't feel my soul
All systems go
Prepare for elevation

Verse 1:
Back at it
I never left though
Always try to [?] bars like Esco
In the middle of this joint like an elbow
Getting high?  Sure as hell flow
I am alkaline, like alpha mine, an alpha mind
In half the time my average rhymes are are paradigms
They can't define
They haven't tried but if they did then it's [?]
I remember feeling like a bitch
I remember crushing on bands
I remember crushing on fans
I remember crushing on plans
I ain't get to kiss and hold hands
Now she suckin dick with no hands
Turn tables, turnin tables, heard the fable, words are hateful, turning grateful, spinning stories, heard the dreidel, scream cause the five shots curve is fatal
I'm nothing like you, I smile in pictures with gangsters
I never leave home with a banger
I found me a ho like Topanga
That's also a woman, I hold her real close like this [?]
I don't want 'formance, I probably cop me a railer
Brush up these haters like pay us
Been opening doors up for strangers
And really do care about mates

Hook (Whispers):
I'm in a Delorean
I'm in a Delorean
I will spread my wings
I ain't going home again
(x2)

Verse 2:
Don't care if my wish is a glacier
That shit gonna melt cause of carbon emmissions
Hip hop took an L cause the bars are just listening
Don't care 'bout your flow 'cause it's still hard to listen to
Pitting you fools against Chris is just pitiful, wait
Fuck am I saying?, I just must be hating
'cause clearly they're better 'cause they do more famous
They got
More money, more bitches, more cars
Only thing I got more than them is just bars
And heart, and art, and strength, and faith, and pain, and skill, and will and flows and [?], and concepts  and content, and competence, common sense, dominance, providence, promises, that's all
Hat off to the whack sauce A1 rappers who they bad for
They the safe game, all
Backwards if they act soft
Stayed them [?], rappers

Pre hook:
I feel like
I feel like
I feel like
A winner
I just wanna leave this Earth
I just wanna be the first
I just wanna travel through time to a place where we lost and then acknowledge our worth

Hook (Whispers):
I'm in a Delorean
I'm in a Delorean
I will spread my wings
I ain't going home again
(x2)

Verse 3:
You only follow and listen to everything
And then you complain
You go to school, get a job, and want wedding rings
And you're mad you the same
You want a big, big house to put all that shit that you gathered but know it can never contain
Your love, 'cause that's all internal
I'm not here to hurt you
Virtue versus purchase flesh
Heard the worst your worth is less
Than worthlessness is merciless
Get merchant dress to turn the stress to
Mask and bask in everlasting sadness and
Attachments to the fashion that these
Fastens harness fast into your
Passions and your drive
But I revive the known disguise
To show the pride just means the prize
Just means to be proud right out your pride if
You decide that you reside within the side that coincides with
What's inside and
That your size is not decided by your height, but what's inside

Hook (Whispers):
I'm in a Delorean
I'm in a Delorean
I will spread my wings
I ain't going home again
(x2)

I feel like
I feel like
I feel like
A winner! (x2)
