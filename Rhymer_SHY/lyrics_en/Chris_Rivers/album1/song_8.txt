[Intro]
I've been debilitated
Since I was a kid, all you niggas hated
Well, look at me now
Picked up the crown and then put it back down
I never needed it

[Hook]
Don't ever [?], dasafac
No postin' it up, being [?], dasafac
I always did the most, dasafac
They called it a miracle, dasafac
Some niggas be flippin' like acrobats
Baby, don't trip, where your passion at?
I want to see me win back to back
Like, dasafac, dasafac, dasafac, ayy

Don't ever [?], dasafac
No postin' it up, being [?], dasafac
I always did the most, dasafac
They called it a miracle, dasafac
Some niggas be flippin' like acrobats
Baby, don't trip, where your passion at?
I want to see me win back to back
Like, dasafac, dasafac, dasafac, ayy

[Verse 1]
Made it and I did it with my Gs up
Social when a nigga get the cheese up
Did the most existentials for the Lisa
Flippin' big birds in the streets, that was the ostrich
Never seen Batman, but Robbin was all in our conscious
Fuck all the capes, went from playin' [???]
They're diggin' up crates, I'm blowin' that smoke in your face
You better bring some weed if you smokin' though
You better bring your wings if you floatin' though
You better squeeze them cheeks if you hoein', hoe
You going to see me increase like I'm over [?]
I'ma be spittin' that dope till they overdose
Ride-or-die's rollin' with me like a rodeo
Picture me winnin', I'm buildin' portfolios
Dark, but I'm makin' that cream like an Oreo

[Hook]
Don't ever [?], dasafac
No postin' it up, being [?], dasafac
I always did the most, dasafac
They called it a miracle, dasafac
Some niggas be flippin' like acrobats

I want to see me win back to back

Like, dasafac, dasafac, dasafac, ayy

[Verse 2]
Packin' the MAC in back of the [?]
If you attack, there's a plan for that
How you gon' slack? There's an app for that
Fuck, what you lack, there's a nigga with half of that
Seein' your spot and he's after that
Bitch, where your passion at? I'm always askin' that
Can't have a [?] work ethic when only your dreams be the Cadillacs
Bitch, I'm the man, stop bein' a kid, get your Cabbage Patch
If I ain't rollin', I'm scrollin'
If I ain't runnin', I'm walkin'
If I ain't walkin', I'm crawlin'
If I ain't crawlin', I'm flyin'
If I ain't livin', I'm dyin', nigga
Never back down, you doubt to pull up and try, nigga
[?] a nigga with the sling and the stones, I'm a king with these poems
Just want the bling and the hoes
Honest, still feel like I'm woke, some haters still think it's a joke
I just want millis on millis
I just want momma to know that I'm winnin'
I just want haters to know it's my city
You feel me? You feel me
You don't? Then you don't, don't mean shit to me, really
I'll be that nigga [?] Heffe, got your bitch callin' me, "Sensei"
'Cause we kickin' it like a [?]
Stay ahead of y'all, bitch, I've been ready 'cause
