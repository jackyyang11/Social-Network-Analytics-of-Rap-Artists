It's Chris Rivers... Sway...Yeah...

[Verse]
Now I done been through a whole lot
Nothing but gunshots and shelters on my old block
Stove tops, colder than coke rocks cooked from coal drock
They tote Glocks holding my life, hoping their whole shots
No pops, my soul drops, sisters and moms, assisted to do songs
Praying for answers, take a hits through a bong
21 I seen... seven thousands rises of suns
I seen way too many fucking kids die by the guns
Seen thousands of Puns or actors, fat Spanish rappers
I deal with bastards, hazards/Ashers[?], hagglers and pastors
Roll with nothing but dragons, everything I do I'm not slacking
Yo, Yo, everything I do, I'm just attacking
I spit hazardous, disastrous, bitch smack you Chris
Rolling with pseudonyms, nothing you can do to them
I spit rapidly, know that I'm just magically flowing attacking these
Trojans, you know I go off the top, it's how I do it
Sway just throw me some words so I can flip it off the top
And I can just converse...

[Sway]
Tyrannosaurus Rex

Tyrannosaurus, when I come through I'm always spitting them thesaurus
When I come through you know I got Kung-Fu, and it's a wrecks[?] like a T-Rex
You know what's next, it's the BX
I spit hazardous, disastrous, bitch smack a Chris
Pseudonym, pseudonym, give me another word so I can just...

[Sway]
Cadillacs

Cadillacs, I give niggas cataracts with rapid raps
When I flow I just attack, motherfuckers know I'm not a monster
I just harbor, all the pain inside I'm likes a doctor
Nostradamus, Ghandi, when I'm fucking off the top
You know I'm just rhyming like the stars just be aligning
When I'm off the top you it's crazy like a guillotine
I kill the king, motherfuckers know that I'm so serene

[Sway]
Talk about the Grammy's

Talk about the Grammy's, motherfuckers know I'm like
Praying to my granny cause she want to see me there one day
And I don't give a damn because I'm here right now on Sway
Yeah I do this everyday
Yeah, Yeah you I'm like too hot off top, you that shit that I just rocked
I boulder[?], motherfucking super soldier, supernova
I'm spitting at all that shit that you just think is colder
I'm a Pluto breeze and I flow with ease

[Sway]
Who's your top five rappers?

Who's my top five?
It's my Mos Def, Big Pun, my dad
Yeah I said Big Pun already, who else
Eminem, Lupe, Touché, who the fuck else?
I can't remember right now
Cause I'm freestyling, meanwhile in my mind I'm just wilding
I flip it off top like timing[?]
Timing like a metronome, I break your bones, every time I skin a tone
Motherfuckers know I got the throne

[Sway]
Talk about ISIS

Isis, what's Isis, oh the terrorist group
No it's not nice bitch
And Isis is sort of a Greek goddess
And when I'm flowing like Zeus
You know I'm spreading the news
And I'm Artemis, I got this shit
I got this shit, like rocket ships
I'm in my fucking element, I spit like it's phosphorus
Everyone to know it's like off the cranium
I'm titanium, uranium
Motherfuckers know I'm blazing them

[sway]
Longitude and latitude

Longitude and latitude, niggas give me gratitude
Around the planet, I ain't mad at you
No I am not, I don't give a fuck because I'm actual
I'm tactical and magical and fucking mathematical
Like Mos Def, mathematics, Ms. Big Booty
You know I truly do-do-do these
And motherfucker, you know I got this shit that's off top
That's so wicked, and I fucking kill it, Chris Rivers

[Sway]
Talk about Easter

Easter eggs, motherfuckers know I just, just does eat you dead
Because I'm cannibal, actual mandable[?], crack mandibles
Cannibal like I said before, you know this shit is actual, tactical

Yo let me flow acapella

I spit hazardous, disastrous, bitch smack a Chris
Pseudonym, niggas need goose in them just to rap at it[?]
Immaculate, I be cleaner than spit lathered kicks, I pass you all while draining my dick, my piss mastered this, my shit too
I wipe my ass and flush the gifted too
I spit hieroglyphics, inside my lyrics are visuals
Known to split oceans with poems, I'm fucking biblical
Young Moses, I rode the Lotus into the pinnacle
Tremendous, stupendous, quench the thirst of the masses
On average having a status being the first of the massive
Dragons attacking this rap, I done bought them, inhabit them[?]
And if I die, cause of my size you could get lost in my casket
Toast to Galactus, master devotion on practice
I spit bars so large they warp the orbit of planets
Crossing assassins, you niggas are like porcelain wrapping
I kick in every door now when this awesomeness happen
When it's flawlessness, victory, gorgeousness, consistency
Never fuck with Rivers unless you offer your virginity
Cause lyrically, you cannot fuck with me or visit me
Even at your highest point you still wouldn't hit my knee, nigga please
Collapse your physics, it's some rapping midgets
Punch your chest so hard, make you shoulders clap like glass or dishes
My raps are wicked, I gradually retract my lyrics
Just so you could catch up to the passion of my after-image
I ain't my pops B, but I'ma bust a gun bumping a LOX B with Oxies
[????????]
Nigga's hobbies, I got mommy clocking the Glock, see
Ain't the violent type, born from real, how could I not be?
Gimme probably's but I've always knew that I've been the dude
Fuck these other niggas, can't bless a verse or an interlude
Like I ain't the shit, like I ain't rhyming like a veteran?
Name one nigga coming right now that I ain't better than
You're feminine
Sweeter than cinnamon but I stay raw
Slap the shit out of you bitch, like I wear an Eightball[?]
Hungry, ain't got a buck in the bank
I'm to the point where every rapper look like something to shank
Rivers
