[Verse 1: Chris Rivers]
I look into my past and I can barely force a smile
The common misconceptions that parents afford a child
From the fires of experience happiness hand me downs
And the wisdom you acquire not angry and actin' wild
You're worse than the bullies, the rapists and pedophiles
It's you that we should trust to protect us and make us proud
I just try to be the man that you presented to me
Not the man that you showed your friends and you pretended to be
I looking mami's eyes and say "I kill' em if I could"
But I'm too damn weak and small and I'm not sure if I even should
But I've seen what he's done to you
And I know it isn't good
If I could be a shining armor, I swear to god that I would
And I wish I said more things but I was young and I was voiceless
And I couldn't find the words that
Made you feel like they were choices
Make you feel like you were priceless
When you petrified with fear
Go tell my sistas and my moms, just know I'm stronger and I'm here

[Hook: Sy]
Are you brave in the dark, are you brave
Are you brave in the dark
Are you king when the lights on
Are you brave in the dark, are you brave
Are you brave in the dark
Are you king when the lights on
Are you brave in the dark, are you brave
Are you brave in the dark
Are you king when the lights on
Are you brave in the dark, are you brave
Are you brave in the dark
Are you king when the lights on

[Verse 2: Chris Rivers]
Shout out to the children who has overcame these challenges
Prayers to the kids who couldn't cope and broke they bandages
Old and very young that this world is filled with savages
Even if ya home ya never safe but we can manage this
Shout out to the mothers that tried to hold it steady had a
Sprained wrist and black eyes and still would make spaghetti and
Told to look away whenever things were getting scary but the
Vision through my space, stop fingerprints would not impair me
Plus I knew that we was next, its ok ma, take a rest
You've given blood and flesh, I'll let ya K here get the rest
And though I'm heavy wit regrets I know one thing for sure
That your fears that make you fall are even smaller standing tall
So I'm standing with my chin way higher than it should be
And got punched right in that statement and rattled and shook my teeth
And I swallowed one or two, staggered upon my feet
And then he kicked my legs from under
But still wouldn't face defeat

[Hook: Sy]
Are you brave in the dark, are you brave
Are you brave in the dark
Are you king when the lights on
Are you brave in the dark, are you brave
Are you brave in the dark
Are you king when the lights on
Are you brave in the dark, are you brave
Are you brave in the dark
Are you king when the lights on
Are you brave in the dark, are you brave
Are you brave in the dark
Are you king when the lights on

[Bridge: Sy]
At night break the glass let the lion roar
At night break the glass let the lion roar
At night break the glass let the lion roar
At night break the glass let the lion roar
At night break the glass let the lion roar
At night break the glass let the lion roar
At night break the glass let the lion roar
At night break the glass let the lion roar

[Hook: Sy]
Are you brave in the dark, are you brave
Are you brave in the dark
Are you king when the lights on
Are you brave in the dark, are you brave
Are you brave in the dark
Are you king when the lights on
Are you brave in the dark, are you brave
Are you brave in the dark
Are you king when the lights on
Are you brave in the dark, are you brave
Are you brave in the dark
Are you king when the lights on

[Outro: Sy]
Are you king, are you king, are you king
Are you king, are you king, are you king
Are you king, are you king, are you king
