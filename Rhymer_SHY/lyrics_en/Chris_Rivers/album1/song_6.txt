[Hook]
Maybe  I was born for this
Maybe I matured for this
Maybe I was lost in the sauce
And flossed on no floss being poor
Maybe it was all for this
Maybe there's awards for this
Maybe I was tossin' them offices all these offerin's
Often since thoughts been orbitin'
Coffins the course of walkin' and talkin' & my endorphins is stalkin'
Warmers been coughing up lozenges
Maybe I was born for this

[Verse 1]
Boom boom bap bust a new rap
Who that dudes with some shoes that's loose and a new cap
Given from a church who give you scraps
Could be the greatest and he new that
He was the only one who knew that
Maybe i'm too fat
Maybe i'm tooth gapped
Maybe i'm too old school for the new rap
Maybe I use pro tools to undo that, Uh
Went from riches to rags
Before i considered the valley off dough in which riches is bad
Shitters is sad, wonder if deals an option
If  I turn a profit bout six and a half
Thoughts of a young niggas
Saw the valley of a man who's guns bigga
And the change in the whip for the drug dealer
In the valley of the damned i'm a sun singer
Nigga i'm hope
Nigga i'm broke
Really had faith I never been a pope
Nights without water had to dance in the rain to wash away the pain but  I didn't have soap
Didn't have coats for the winter
Got me ready for this cold world shivers
Insoles got my skin a lot thicker
These foes now my fist a lot quicker
Nigga i'm rivers its trainin' time
Product of the block and a niggas popping shots with no aim this time
Its either be a [?] with some [?]tripple with the rock for the fame this time uh, uh
Its in my veins this time uh, uh
Its in my pain this time uh, yes
It pays to rhyme
Its been a long time no more patience time

[Hook 2]
Maybe  I was born for this
Maybe I matured for this
Maybe I was lost in the sauce
And flossed on no floss being poor
Maybe it was all for this
Maybe there's awards for this
Maybe I was tossin' them offices all these offerin's
Often since
Maybe  I was born for this
Maybe I matured for this
Maybe I was lost in the sauce
And flossed on no floss being poor
Maybe it was all for this
Maybe there's awards for this
Maybe I was tossin' them offices all these offerin's
Often since thoughts been orbitin'
Coffins the course of walkin and talkin' & my endorphins is stalkin'
Warmers been coughing up lozenges
Maybe I was born for this

[Verse 2]
Maybe there's a path in this
Maybe there's some cash in this
Maybe if i'm accurate
Pen and the pad in the back of the class type shit
Maybe if i'm passionate
Maybe if I pray to god but whats the odds if god had bars he would rap like this
Rap like half of this
Maybe there's an ad for this
Maybe there's no love in this
Maybe I should fucking quit
Man I put sweat, tears, blood in this
Never had doubts ain't no strungs in this man its fuckin' chris
Go so pro these hoes give throat like vocal cords
Postin' four toes loadin' throw throws know my stroke is so pogo so know through cold shit I
Hope, wishful thinking with my pencil reeking
Raised in the x but i'm still yorican
Always got depressed when they stressed the seasons
Never got fresh and the kids was teasin'
Sneeks are leanin' keep on breathin, need a reason
See the demons, heathens preachin'
I dont hear shit unless my dreams are speakin' uh
Husstlin' strugglin' beggin fucked up from mun shine and runnin' gunnin' for suckas im chasing money and grub again
Ain't no love when you wonderin' when will I give a fuck again
Musterin' courage to keep on runnin' but once again
