[Hook]
It ain't hard to tell, I excel then prevail
The mic is contacted

[Verse One]
So what you want from me, cuts come for the custody
I'm comfortably becoming the cover kid of the company
Luxury, Pun in me acknowledge my river mastered the ebonics
I paid homage, I tussled , hustled hard and slaid giants
Ya stay lyin, trying say I' ain't the hottest
I'm ???
A prophet Nostradamus with the pen and pad, remember dad
Never had the oppurtinity that they let us had
To immortalize, but I take in his craft to more than rhymes
Highly addictive with lyrics, Shady may stole my lines
I walked defined from a kid to a man
So when you talk about my teeth you got my dick your hand
A tip in your mouth, just to tip I figured it out
When niggas try to say they hate me they deliverin' cloud
Deliverin' doubt, there's nothin that I ever can fear
Turn off the lights to say my name and watch me fucking appear

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
So analyze me, deprive me
Try to sanatize me, dumbed damage trying to glamorise my samurai swing
Straight raw, thousand pounds and still compress a ??
Sprout the fucking ? on the table like an 8 ball
Hate all you want but I'll never retreat
I'm 300 all spartans when I'm marchin' the beat
Larger than Greece, you said I couldn't spit
Where ? at, the ??
I ain't fresh?Nigga you should watch me when I play chess
Made a little money, spend it all like it no pay less
Little sign for the kid that grew up with nothin'
You thinkin' I was rich?Nigga fool was mostly ?
Thinking on my bitch, test me on my score for concussion
You said I breathe loud, freestyle off the top, it's nothin'
And when I excel, I excel like a recell
Spell flame, see my name with the pain, I was birth at hell
