[Verse 1: Bizzle]
Lord, You know I don't wanna write this
But it's all I can think about
As soon as I picked up my pen
This is what the ink started bleedin' out
Woke up this morning, timeline hella thick
Folks like "Biz, did you hear about Connecticut
At the elementary... school?"
No, I didn't, so I turned the news on, but I saw him and he hella sick
A dude ran up in a school, with his tools drawn
Clips flyin', 26 lyin' on the school floor
20 of 'em kids, homie picture that
Parents gotta live with the fact they won't get 'em back
Shot like 50, but they ain't get to rap
When you're 6 to 7 and you done ate 9, homie it's a wrap
Seein' what we become got me finna snap
Heaven's home, this hellhole is just where I'm at

[Hook]
So many of the things that I see here
Got me feelin' like I don't wanna be here
But I know there's a reason, I'm still breathin'
And the Lord's keepin' me here
But I can't just sit back and watch 'em pass away
When I know, I know, I know, I know that there's a better way
Better way

[Verse 2: Bizzle]
Lord, help me understand I won't always understand
As long as you a God and I am just a man
Who am I to say we should move God's hand?
And who is men to have to improve God's plan?
They're like "Where is your God?" I'm like "I don't know
When you kicked him outta your schools, where'd you tell Him to go?"
You know, we forget about the Lord when that plane flying
But how fast we remember when that plane diving..
Sick of this place I'm in
We kill 3500 children a day and remain silent
Maybe it's late timing
If he would have caught 'em in '05 with different tools we would have stayed quiet
Maybe he misunderstood
Maybe he thought, what he was doin' was all good
Maybe what he heard was "school" and "kill 'em in the room"
When you really said it's cool to kill 'em in the womb..

[Hook]
So many of the things that I see here
Got me feelin' like I don't wanna be here
But I know there's a reason, I'm still breathin'
And the Lord's keepin' me here
But I can't just sit back and watch 'em pass away
When I know, I know, I know, I know that there's a better way
Better way
