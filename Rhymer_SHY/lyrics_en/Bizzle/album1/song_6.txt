[Verse 1: Bizzle]
Look
They call me Bizzle I can spit it with the best of them
I'm a rider for the father and his SON
Did it for the love of God no check no ends
Still blessed no diamonds on my neck no gems
Let a hater be a hater
I labor for the maker
And it ain't about the paper
Gotta cater like a waiter
I'm giving Him my best
Straight Anita Baker
Cuz they ain't me
But they ain't try to say they need a Savior
Finna get it poppin'
Gotta let the hood know they bigger than the block is
And quittin's not an option
They throwin' you a curve ball
Pitching you the nonsense
Like college is for idiots
And prison's where it's poppin'
The game is throwed off
It's no longer artistic
It's bar for bar wicked if you're hocking all lyrics
Learn to profit offa down-talking all women
Placing all that's opposite of God's laws in all children
Tell the truth dog
You don't hate me cuz I'm lying
You hate it cuz you ain't wanna change it
And I'm trying
Saying it will endanger the paper that you eyein'
Good
Cuz paper ain't the aim of my assignment
God Over Money
My new way of living
A state of mind that woulda kept plenty outta prison
It's hope for the young if the grown ups would grow up
And be the role models rappers shoulda been for us
Bizzle

[Verse 2: Sevin]
Ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah
Straight up mane
Hog Mob
Let's Go
Game recognize game I've been OG
I'm a specimen embedded in the MOB
Very aware of the inheritance that's meant fo' me
He went to the low key to pay my intro fee
So free am I
Rolling like a Semi
Plus the flow is colder than the snow be out in NY
To silence us it's gonna take some vi'lence and a miracle
Our sight is that of Silas
It excites us something terrible
We're wearing the apparel that you say is so unbearable
The Jericho of Pharaoh
Don't get buried in the parables boy
It's survival of the fittest
And I'm moving with tribe that was described within Leviticus
I'm living this
With no love for the opposition
You know my position soon as you pop the disc in
Listen I'm bringing sight into your Godless vision
So hopefully you'll be discipled
Before you're locked in prison
New breed of Christian
Set free not conditioned
All we need is God's permission
Obedient flock addition
Off-top submission
Go hard pop ignition
I'd rather have my Father's riches than a pot to piss in
For your information my soul has been appraised and
It's got a sign on it saying no solicitation
Rap is just a vice for me
I could do what you do but you're doo doo
I'm likened to a Viking or a Zulu
Sevin

[Verse 3: KamBINO]
Since I put God over bread
I'll have as much money as there is sky overhead
See that paycheck to paycheck survival is dead
Sow good reap better
That's my motto instead
Mindstate kingdom
Flow otherworldly
These pigpen rappers can't go where my pearls be
Lames
Should give them all swirlies
Swear they rough and tough
Really softer than my girl's feet
No callous
Spread love no malice
Except towards the prince of the air
No palace
His kingdom's like a three legged chair
No balance
Bout to fall down the hole of the hair
No Alice
Life's in 3D I don't need the glasses
How'd I be the emcee
How Imma teach the classes
Airways too filthy so I'mma bleach the masses
Ya'll can have that fast life
I'mma be molasses
Slow steady
Flow heavy and it's sweet too
I be spittin' bars just to satisfy my sweet tooth
Feedin' em in God's house
Catch me in the streets too
Where they feast on fear don't come out here
Cuz they may eat you
Ha
I'm made for this
Bible plagiarist
You monkey rappers you could never be as ape as this
Inherit abundance nah there's no escapin' it
Money always finds me never catch me chasin' it
