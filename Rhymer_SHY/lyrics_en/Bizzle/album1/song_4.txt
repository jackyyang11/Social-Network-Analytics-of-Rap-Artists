[Intro: GS]
They ain't got it
I been all up in the hood, they ain't got it
I been all up in the streets, they ain't got it
I been all up in the trap, they ain't got it

[Hook: GS]
They ain't got it, They ain't got it like that
I pull up and then hop out but they ain't bout it like that
I was lookin' for the Word, couldn't find it like that
I'm just trynna catch a body for the body like that
But they ain't got it, they ain't got it
They ain't got it, they ain't got it
They ain't got it like that
I pull up, then hop out, they ain't bout it like that
I'm just trynna catch a body for the body like that

[Verse 1: Bizzle]
OG told me, no degree, he could see a couple g's a week
Guaped up two years, Locked up for the next eight, easily
2G's, 52 weeks, times two is 208K
Wait, over ten years? Homie coulda made that at chick-fil-a
Really, I ain't with the fakery
Did it all, A-Z
Pitchin' lies in the kitchen, whippin pies tell'em save it for the bakery
All that talkin', I be dead on it
Toss it in the coffin' with a nail on it
Every lie they be sellin' down when that 25 got an L on it
Everybody tell on everybody
Everybody go the Judas route
Ain't nobody stickin' to the G code they was tellin you about
I be in the prisons with them real killers you be actin' like you wanna be
They be tellin me to tell ya'll prisoners something you don't ever wanna see
I ain't frontin' like I was an O-Dogg, no dogg, I was just K
Just a boy in the hood, never been a dope boy, I was just Trey
I was lookin' for the truth, though
Streets came with a loop whole
Now I live by a new code
Proverbs 22:4

[Hook: GS]
[They ain't got it
They ain't got it like that
I pull up and then hop out but they ain't bout it like that
[I was lookin' for the Word, couldn't find it like that
I'm just trynna catch a body for the body like that
But they ain't got it, they ain't got it
They ain't got it, they ain't got it
They ain't got it like that
I pull up, then hop out, they ain't bout it like that
I'm just trynna catch a body for the body like that

[Verse 2: Dee-1]
Just got my dreads twisted to the back
Pull up in my 98 Honda, to the track
Middle of the trap, everybody give me dap
They out in New Orleans be yellin' out "woah what is that?"
That's that Bible on my lap, dogg
Boy I don't just rap, dogg
This a spiritual war, I gotta stay strapped dogg
They might not want it but they need it
(Hold up, hold up wait.)
I be savin' souls like Doctor Scholls, and I'm undefeated
I use to be the lil dogg wasn't bangin' or slangin', I was just hangin in the hood
Tellin' people follow me on IG but wasn't leadin' them no where good
But God gave me fresh start like a newborn
Ain't lukewarm, Christ paid for my sins, no coupon
So tell all my boys in the hood it's the least I could do for 'em

[Hook: GS]
[They ain't got it

I'm just trynna catch a body for the body like that
