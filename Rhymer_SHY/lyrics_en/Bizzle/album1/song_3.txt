(Verse 1: Bizzle)
They like, "What you rap about Christ for?"
I don't know, what you rap about ice for?
You see homie, the Lord is my life so
That's like asking what I rap about life for?
It's like the game got a quota
How many times you can mention the Lord Jehovah?
You hit that point and they put you on the whole
Other side of the store and nobody sees your product
They put you on a whole other station
And they all on line and you might get on the AM
But come on fam, who get on the radio
And try to find music on the AM station, though?
So chances are, you're more likely to hear a song about drugs
Than the Lord on accident
It's like they tryin to keep God from you
But no matter what the world says, God loves you

(Chorus)
Oh Lord, what you do to them so do wrong?
You even gave your life
So that we might find salvation
I wonder what they got against you
That they reject your love
And all that you've done for us
I know it must hurt you deeply, still I
I wonder what they got against you?

(Verse 2)
Lord, I don't understand
Maybe they just cower at the power in your hands
And they would do anything for the power in your hands
And to let em down, that would a coward of a man\
And it was all good just a week ago
But now they takin that same Adam and Eve approach
See they was cool being underneath God
'Til the devil came, like "F that, you can be God!"
And that's the tip baby on a date
And why they took you out of school's kind of hard to say
But when they feed the youth thought is foolish evolution talkin They can't prove is hard on they fate
The other day a couple teachers of the school
Were persecuted for sayin a prayer over the food
But today that become a crime to do
I'ma be a criminal, tell em do what they gotta do

(Chorus)
Oh Lord, what you do to them so do wrong?
You even gave your life
So that we might find salvation
I wonder what they got against you
That they reject your love
And all that you've done for us
I know it must hurt you deeply, still I
I wonder what they got against you?

(Verse 3)
I think I know what it is father
I finally figured out what it is bout ya
I figured they know that if you exist
There's a lot of sin they love doin they gotta quit, Father
And the only ones calling it a fairy tale
Are the ones for which the story doesn't end as well
Maybe they like it better if they mention hell
Like a thief if the law never said he went to jail
I was seeking the truth, found it and I submit already
They just want the truth that agrees with how they feel already
So if they like the sin and they tired of fightin it
They just find another god that don't mind it then
We got so used to democracy
We think we have the right to vote who we want God to be
God will be God with or without you, honestly
Your father is still your father even if you decide to leave

(Chorus)
Oh Lord, what you do to them so do wrong?
You even gave your life
So that we might find salvation
I wonder what they got against you
That they reject your love
And all that you've done for us
I know it must hurt you deeply, still I
I wonder what they got against you?
