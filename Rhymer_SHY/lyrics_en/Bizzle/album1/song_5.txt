Yeah
Bizzle
GOD over money
We here now
Ai’ght

First of I rep CHRIST and I don’t jump teams
I’m a son of GOD , the game covered in sunscreen
I am what you get when a dirtbag becomes clean
Met the KING and re-evaluated what “up” mean
And I ain’t never made a mill just a couple of thousand
Still a long way up from that public housing
I don’t do first class I’m still coach with it
That’s still fly to somebody with no ticket
Coulda been sleeping already in Liz floor still
And the car full of trash bags of clothes still
Still a lot of money that I ain’t touched
But I never let you convince me that I ain’t up
And I ain’t had a pair of J’s in my closet for years
Ain’t no diamonds in my chain, that just not how I live
See me in the same clothes, I’mma rock them again
I ain’t  tryna look rich I’m tryna cop me a crib
I ain’t tryna stunt I’m tryna leave guap to my kids
I create my own up not what y’all think it is
Grew up broke so I still dream of reaching the day
I can drive a bucket and not care what people will say
But it is hard in the culture where they see you as dirt
And we use money to tell you what people are worth
It’s funny how the ones with real money be tryna hide it
Those who ain’t got it are dying to look like it
And you ain’t gotta no pop bottles dawg forget about ‘em
And if you got you a down chick forget a model
You up whether you cake up or blow up
You can’t live life letting they up be your up
How okay you walking and you got you a lex
Got a mansion in the Hamptons and you out in the ‘jects
Your worth came from your CREATOR and not from the rocks on your neck
There’s always somebody richer and somebody with less
I know a village where they ain’t even got water to drink
While we just be letting water run all in the sink
They drink it and die, it’s killing ‘em destroying they kids
But you could probably drink water from your toilet and live
So I ain’t really impressed with you making it rain
Cause all you making is noise if you ain’t making it change
I ain’t saying that your life isn’t rough too
But it’s a lot of people that your down is up to… Bizzle!

GOD over Money
