'We them believers ,east side, west side boy we all around , no side , south side world wide bound. We could of been veneto? but we pray for your town and every where that we go you know we hold it down. We just a bunch of sinners out here tryna follow Christ, they love to see us fall mane hate to see us fly and we ain't perfect either we try to get it right and we don't only read up we boutta live dat? life. They play us in the media with stereo types but even when they hate us we love them on site. They wishing death upon us just for tryna bring em light but that's alright'!

Chorus:

Bizzle ''We them believers, we don't believers in calling right wrong  and wrong right, we them believers they say the problem with us in the dark is our light. We them believers the only way we know is.. to go hard on site. we them believers we roll with Jesus  cause he gave it all; for our... life.''
