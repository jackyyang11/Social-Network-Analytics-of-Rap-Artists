[Intro]
Yea its bizzle the bloggers say i only got 15 seconds of fame
Boy am i glad it ain't up to you
Let's see what God got to say abot it
Lets go

[Bridge]
They say i only got 15 seconds
Just 15 seconds, just 15 seconds of fame
Okay than watch what i do with it
Ima get it poppin till my 15 seconds up man
Give me my 15 seconds of fame
Just 15 seconds just 15 seconds of fame
Okay now watch what i do with it
Ima show it only take 15 seconds to change

[Verse 1]
It only take 15 seconds in the bed
Before a sperm cell get to swimming and hit an egg
9 monts later she laying in a different bed
Like it a hinner she grinning
Kissing on an infants head
It only takes 15 seconds to end a bet
Cause i told you don't go to that party, but you went instead
Or vause you was too big
Didn't know what some nigga said
Less than 15 between slipping and hitting your head
In 15 seconds your future can become your past
You can put the weed down and make this next hit your last
Put the drink down
This would be the last if you had
A look up 15 years and it still in your hand

[Chrous]
15 seconds ago you hated
When all 15 bars now i am the greatest
15 seconds from becoming your baby
Now i ain't going nowhere sucker I'm here to stay

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
It only would've took 15 seconds to call the cops
When you saw that boy getting beat up on block
You took 15 minutes to sit there and watch
And the punch the 14th is when his heart stopped
The first 15 seconds of an interview
With the potential employer already knows if he's into you
A girl already knows what kind of play of time of day she giving you weather or not she feeling you
It only takes 15 seconds to contact days
To go through like feeling like you living your last days
Only take 15 seconds to pray and have faith
Before the doctor say your cancer is pass safe

[Chrous]

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
See they say i only got 15 seconds of fame
Like it ain't a lot of things 15 seconds can change
15 seconds of effort will get you closer the better the never will on an effort less quest for the same
15 seconds from now you can look up
Your family dissappear ,but you still here shook up
Bible in your house ,but you never picked the book up
It stayed in your mess and just ain't get took up
It only takes 15 seconds to accept christ
Or embrace the dark side and reject light
But just remember that 15 seconds on Earth can determine where you spend your forever at

[Chrous]

[Bridge]

[Outro]
Yea victory on the beat
