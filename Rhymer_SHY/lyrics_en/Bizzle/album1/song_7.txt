[Intro]
Yeah
God over money
Bizzle

[Verse 1]
We them believers
East side, west side boy we all around
North side, south side world wide bound
You could of been finito
But we pray for your town
And every where that we go
You know we hold it down
We just a bunch of sinners out here tryna follow Christ
They love to see us fall mane, hate to see us fly
And we ain't perfect either, we try to get it right
And we ain't only readers, we bout to lit a life
They play us in the media with stereo types
But even when they hate us we love them on site
They wishing death upon us just for tryna bring em life
But it's alright

[Chorus]
We them believers
We don't believe in calling right wrong
And wrong, right
We them believers
They say the problem with us in the dark, is our light
We them believers
The only way we know to go is hard...on site
We them believers
We roll with Jesus cause He gave it all, for our life
We them believers

[Verse 2]
They know we keep it cool and so they love to play around
They push us to the edge and then they say we wild'n out
But catch us on the wrong day, one of us a clown
Then it will be a long day, it's going down
We don't want no problems, we just living our life
It's hard enough with out a hater tryna cause strife
I'm tripping on my own, just tryna walk right
If I put it in a song, we will be here all night
Been here long enough to know it's not a joke (Not a joke)
I know where I'm headed when its time to go (Time to go)
But until then I get it popping tho (Popping tho)
Keeping Yahweh over dollars tho

[Chorus]
We them believers
We don't believe in calling right wrong
And wrong, right
We them believers
They say the problem with us in the dark, is our light
We them believers
The only way we know, to go is hard...on site
We them believers
We roll with Jesus cause He gave it all, for our life
We them believers

God over money (money) 8x

[Chorus]
We them believers
We don't believe in calling right wrong
And wrong, right
We them believers
They say the problem with us in the dark, is our light
We them believers
The only way we know, to go is hard...on site
We them believers
We roll with Jesus cause He gave it all, for our life
We them believers
