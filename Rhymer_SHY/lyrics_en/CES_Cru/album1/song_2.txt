[Intro]
Yeah (yeah)
One two, one two, one two
One two, yo
Mic check, mic check

[Verse 1: Ubiquitous]
Strictly for the sake of my own amusement
Makin' music that I've infused with illusion
That's all that life is and there's nothin' to it (yeah!)
So what the fuck have y'all been doin' bein' human?
You would never assume it, all the shit I'm in tune with
Gimme two minutes, I'll put an end to the critics
Fair weather fans and cynics, I'm better with analytics
Simpleton savages couldn't manage to manage business
Averages averages they don't man I ran the percentage
Doin' my civic duty and you couldn't get to Ubi
Livin' in the boonies, I fit the euphemism for loony
Lookin' ludacris, kablooey, I blew this shit into kibbles and bits
Belittle your clique, in the middle I sit
The killer city committee meet and kill 'em in third
I'm feelin' disturbed when a villain emerged
Now I'm chillin', I'm as vicious as the realest you heard
Wit' my pen I kill 'em absurd, and rhyme seven syllable words
Yo!

[Hook 1: Ubiquitous]
I'm not your average Joe (hard-h-h-hardcore)
(F-f-far more than the average)
(I'm as vicious as the realest you know)
(Only difference is consistence I'm considered a pro)
I don't got mad dough, cars, designer clothes but still
I'm not your average Joe
(Maniacal approach, my product is dope)
(You're listenin' to the pro with accurate flow)

[Verse 2: Ubiquitous]
Yo
I got one foot in the game, one foot on the floor
Head in the sky, hand on a panhandle, a bum beggin' for more
Someone peg him as old, a stegosaurus oppose
My gumball's big and bold, no regular show
Phenomenon, John Legend-ary, heaven would know
I'm on a never ending run, Dave Letterman
My enemies on a Ethan Hunt, but they can't get in my zone
Li'l Caesar one, eight, seven your soul, blow!
You get the picture, closed caption, I know your stats
Expose negatives under developed photographs
I flow effortless, ces regiment growin' fast
Deal intact, fuck around and feel the wrath, hold the math
Ja Rule told me that the pendulum swing
And that only the underground can bring an end to the king
He was lookin' stunted he stunted on him with treasure and bling
A man measured by the spread of his wing, put that on everything

[Hook 2: Ubiquitous]
Yeah
Money was never a thing
Not-not your average Joe
(I'm as vicious as the realest you know)
(Only difference is consistence I'm considered a pro)
And these rap clones should know I'm no  Donny Brasco, for real
I'm not your average Joe
(Maniacal approach, my product is dope)
(Listen in to the bro with the accurate flow)

[Outro: Ubiquitous]
Yo
Say what you say, I'm in it 'til I get a few rings
I'll never Cobain, I'm lifted off this medical strain
I wet up your brain, I'm on a different level, insane
Evident save, vile villain with the venom in veins
I'll never change, like a residue with red and blue stains
They never knew they, would meet me
Then they'd met a new fate
An edible plate, if you're listening, I said a few things
Yeah, if you're listening, I said a few things
