[Intro: Godemis]
It's not as complicated as it sounds

[Verse 1: Godemis]
Stuck in a coffin coughin'
I be here much too often
My headless body walkin'
Melancholy and stalkin'
My hands'll grip the chalk and
Commence and sketch a
Pentagram and set it off and
Baby girl, is you walkin'?
I'd hate to step and scare ya, check it, Scarlet, my letter
Knowing two and three better
Four to five and whatever
Six or seperate season, hollow fellow, cheetah precision
Through the leaves like when the wind breezin', believin' this heathen
Hecklin' at the helpless, bringin' yo' flames to melt this
Tongue on the tonsil death kiss, crucifix in the necklace
My soul is rather precious
Deel if you've never felt this
Prayer couldn't even help this
Self-therapy, selfish
I'm the head on the willow
Under lead and pillow
Dee, I love you to ditto
Here go Goddy again
Gotta grin and I'm sun spotted, not even borderline
Hideous lyricist, wit' it, distorted mind for real

[Hook 1: Godemis] (x2)
You get your face bust
Get your chest bust, open for nothin'
Get your back bust
Get your head bust, open for nothin'

[Verse 2: Sorceress]
Incoherent idiots got me flarin'
Figure it "fuck it", let 'em
Fall victim and forget 'em
Follow and watch it catch 'em, but who am I to meddle?
One day, you'll all regret it, just remember who said it
Can't take all of the credit, unleashin' armageddon
Severed head [?], so fuck your metaphor
On set perseph just stepped in
Oblivious hands of a weapon
So much for second guessin', [?]
[?]
Oh, so now you wanna sweat shit?
Really gettin' hectic, this evil blade beneath the blind
So bleed and keep on steppin', [?]
Idolize [?], [?]
[?]

[Hook 2: Sorceress] (x2)
You get your whip bust
Get your juice crushed, open for nothin'
Get your mouth bust
Get your squad rushed, open for nothin'

[Verse 3: Ubiquitous]
Meet the malicious master
Metaphors manufactured
Criminals captured, executions met at my discretion
C-section, next selection
Protect your Prime Directive
Derelict disrespected, go get your mind corrected
Yes, Ces are resurrected, infections spreading, verbal virus
Causing total violence, recollect your rank assignment
Best respect your colonel, private
Onslaught to leave your race divided
Make you reconsider faith and change alignment, slave
You sick in servile silence
We keep the stage ignited
You claim you're fly and still, you're grounded wit' no plane to pilot
Lyrical heavyweight, Ubiquitous the reigning tyrant
My shit is off the wall like patients in insane asylums
Thoughts of a broken nature
Victory's hopeless hater
Never been known to cater, rearrange your nomenclature
The name eraser, feacher smoker, hope to own a acre
So fuck your chain, your Motorola and your stolen pager
Percussion prone to danger
Fuck up a fallen fighter
While squarin' off in final battle like we Squall and Seifer
Demented dentist, dedicating this to all the biters
With a Kodachi having Kobayashi calling Kaiser
Charged like an Energizer, flexin' electric current
Taking the learning higher
Watch for the lecture's wording
Provide your sector's service, snatching your checks to burn it
Snapping your neck to turn it
Respect? I'm next to earn it

[Hook 3: Ubiquitous] (x2)
And get your rhyme bust
Get your rep bust, open for nothin'
And get your mic bust
Get your clique bust, open for nothin'
