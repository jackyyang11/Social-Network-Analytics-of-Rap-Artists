[Verse 1: Godemis]
Pop the lock box swingin' the sledge
My freezer full of body parts:
Legs, arms and heads
I keep the intestines in bottles right up under my bed
A batch of bladders bottled up in the shed
I chuckled and said
"Steven keep it cool and come walking in my direction
Nothing personal , I need your intestines for my collection"
Fetching for a serial killer
But not fo' rilla
No protection when I'm snatching your bladder like it was thriller
Pounced on him like a gorilla
Then vertically flipped the butterfly knife
Covered his mouth, turned him over, stabbed him in the back twice
Now in a pity the blood is starting to come out of his body
Plus the front door is unlocked and the lights are still on in the lobby
Somebody's home, drag the body knocked over the phone
With a Collie growling at the gate that won't leave me alone
See I realised the mess I made dragging him out the trunk
Plus I'm too faded to operate then cleaned it all up
Visual Shutdown
Stitch with a serial killer shuts down
Killing Steven because there wasn't no sluts 'round
Dragging a 365 pound carcass around
Not suspected just because I ain't the weirdest in town

[Verse 2: Ubiquitous]
I was making the nightly rounds in my dusty police cruiser
Working the graveyard, alcoholic abuser
Kahlua in my coffee
Box of donuts on the dash
Creepin' at 15 miles an hour with a limp foot on the gas
Passing by dark houses its lights out, its looking quiet
A burst of a barking dog in the night
Breaking the silence
I put on my front lights and my brights
Straining my eyes trying to find a sign of violence
With an anxious pain in my privates
I spied it-
What looked to be a Collie on a leash
On the other side of the gate with red stains on its feet
Hopping out of the cruiser
Approaching the place with gun drawn
Danger was inherent but upon me it doesn't dawn
So I stumbled along the lawn trying to be cautious
Shaking my head to get sober
The blood's making me nauseous
Swallowing hard, scared
Following bloody paw prints
Knowing that the killer was close in my subconscious

[Verse 3]
[Godemis]
I heard some footsteps
Either the dead is walking or the gig's up
[Ubiquitous]
I heard something inside the house
Its time for my pace to pick up
[Godemis]
Blood on the patio for that little Collie to lick up
[Ubiquitous]
I put my gun in the holster started picking my night stick up
[Godemis]
Too much evidence
Its evident I'm not alone in residence
So I expose the blade again except without the hesitance
So who's there
Answer or I'm coming out and stabbin'
[Ubiquitous]
Put your hand up and weapons down
This is officer Gavin of the KC police
We've got the property surrounded
[Godemis]
Shit I don't believe in that when no sirens have even sounded
[Ubiquitous]
Got a running start at the house
And put my shoulder to the door
I broke the hinges, lost my balance
Dropped my night stick on the floor
It made a splash
Focused on the horror scene before me
[Godemis]
Feeling this real life not a Stephen King story
[Ubiquitous]
I felt the knife hot in my back
He must have stabbed me from behind
And then again in the same spot but much harder this time
I'm giving in
He's twisting it
Scraping against my spine
[?] Blood running down my sides
