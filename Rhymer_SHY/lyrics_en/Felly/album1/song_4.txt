[Chorus: Gyyps]
Go and get a bag keep your head above water
Spend a lil' cash, keep your head above water
Go and get a bag keep your head above water
Spend a lil' cash, keep your head above water
Keep your head above water
Keep your head above water
Keep your head above water
Keep your head above water

[Verse 1: Felly]
Lord Drake kill em so soft
Tell me nothin come free Imma need the whole lot
Don't you worry 'bout me, tell my people hold on
Be whoever you be, that's whoever you are
And I know it sound sweet, bitch just know it's all talk
See me swerve from my reef but just know i'm straight bossin' bitches
On the green like golf swinging
Out in BK with some broads and bitches
Shit everyone jot it down on my hit list, gone
Oooo you finna' push me to the edge now
And all that's said is since a let down
And why you playin with my head
Oooo I took a couple to the head now
Oooo and was it something that I said
And all that's said is since a let down
And why you playin with my head now

[Chorus: Gyyps]
Go and get a bag keep your head above water
Spend a lil' cash, keep your head above water
Go and get a bag keep your head above water
Spend a lil' cash, keep your head above water
(Woaaahhh) Keep your head above water
(Woaaahhh) Keep your head above water
(Woaaahhh) Keep your head above water
(Breathe) Keep your head above water

[Verse 2: Gyyps]
They gon' be quick to the jump
They gon' be quick to this hate
Yeah yeah
I got a lot for the plug
I got a lot on my plate
Hey hey
She fell in love with the drugs
I fell in love with the bank
Yeah uh
I gotta stick to my guns
I put my feelings away
I took the ceiling away
Please get the fuck out my face
They only love when you losin'
Uncle S take your blue cheese
[Standard?] sell it and recoup it
Aston martin from a hooptie
Elevatin' from the boosters
Innovator, Fela Kuti
Ya'll just threw away the loose leaf
Used to do shows for no profits
You couldn't count all the losses
Southern boy, Killafornia
Still buckets full of crawfish
Still fuck in my garage
I could provide the homies with an option
I could do television, Action Bronson
I could of hit a lick and got a thousand
I could of sold the drugs all around me
Did it all like my daddy
Sold you or flipped you a pen

[Chorus: Gyyps]
Go and get a bag keep your head above water
Spend a lil' cash, keep your head above water
Go and get a bag keep your head above water
Spend a lil' cash, keep your head above water
(Woaaahhh) Keep your head above water
(Woaaahhh) Keep your head above water
(Woaaahhh) Keep your head above water
(Woaaahhh) Keep your head above water
