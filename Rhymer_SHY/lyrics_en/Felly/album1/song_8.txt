[Hook: Felly]
Oou ya ya ya ya
Burnin' up all my problems

[Verse 1: Felly]
Keep my heart like a lion
Good mans gon' die young
Though she bring me that gospel
Young man gotta get him some
Imma see her tomorrow Imma see her
Like when we gon' get it in motion
When we gon' get off that bullshit
Made enough figures to know
I don't need me no more
You'll be richer than fuck and still hopeless
A lil mamma ferocious
She took this off of my chest
Realize that she free
And lay a boy to his death
Gold chain go flex (oou)
No name no stress (yeah)
Bad thing at TX would like to get choked around the neck (damn)
Riding round to the renold wreck I did thirty plugs I been losing track
Still coming home like amen
Crawling back to the same bed like

[Chorus: Felly]
Oooooooooooo
That's all I need
That's all I want
Oooooooooooo
That's all I need
That's all I want

[Hook: Felly]
Like oou ya ya ya ya
Burnin' up all my problems
Louder than them car alarms
Where we go in that dodge yah
Call you up in that proper
Know she wake me up proper

[Verse 2: Trip Carter]
Picking a lock to my soul
Picking up liquor you know me
Baby girl missing the old day
I think its time for a smoke break
She need that back thrown back
I got my tank on E
Baby don't wait on me
Baby don't wait on me
Left my voice back in Houston
Left my bitch in Santa Cruz yeah
Straying from the institution
Slaying hoes with the bruce man
Slayin' hooks for lil F murder
More bite then my mans burner
Endless nigga you ain't ever heard of
Sippin' that dirty dirty
Saying oou I needed that
Shorty said you should bring me back
Really could use a little slack
Really could use a little yeah
Lord you been good to me
Way that she look at me
Lookin' too good she might have to call in sick so I can work her out
Pull her back to bed and get another round saying

[Chorus: Felly]
Oooooooooooo
That's all I need
That's all I want
Like oooooooooooo
That's all
Oooooooooooo
That's all I need
That's all I want
Oooooooooooo
That's all I need
That's all I want

[Hook: Felly]
Like oou ya ya ya ya
Your man gon' get some
Louder than them car alarms
Where we go in that dodge yah
Call you up in that proper
Know she wake me up proper

[Skit]
Getting a handjob while your girls driving
Like she's driving and going like this
And kyles like there like

[Hook: Felly]
Like oou ya ya ya ya
Your man gon' get some
Louder than them car alarms
Where we go in that dodge yah

Yeah bye
