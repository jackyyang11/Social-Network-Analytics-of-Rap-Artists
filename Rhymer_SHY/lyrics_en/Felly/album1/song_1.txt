[Intro]
And my fans know me better than my friends do
I could use some meds
Send ya mans to the rescue
I'm like get up in my head
In my dreads, if I let you
But I’ma paint em red
Paint em red
I’ll fucking end you

[Bridge]
I could get used to
I could get used to
All the shit I used to do
I thought that I was fool proof
Now I lead this new school shit
They be like who you?
Pardon as I move through

[Verse]
Young, Christian F hard in the paint
Risking it all to be great
Get in my car, don’t let me step on the breaks
Turn this shit up, let it bang
Drift
Drifting and swinging through oceans of pain
Can’t get my mind made
Swervin, got too drunk to stay in my lane
Kissing my side thang
No rush mane
No rush mane
Gotta play it safe
Know we had a conversation about on what really matters at the end of the day
Teach us how to be great
Teach us on how to keep our faith
Lord I pray in your name
You just wasted your change
I been free from long days
Keep on living the dream

[Hook]
I could get used to
I could get used to
Coming home with 20 thou
Still ain't drop the new new
Know they wanna run me down
I would if I was you too
Just pray that it ain’t too soon
I could get used to
I could get used to
Coming home with 20 thou
Still ain't drop the new new
Know they finna run me down
I would if I was you too
Just pray that it ain’t too soon

[Outro:: Felly & Frex]
I pray that it ain’t too soon
I pray that it ain’t too soon
I pray that it ain’t too soon
I pray that it ain’t too soon
Pray that it ain’t too soon
Pray that it ain’t too soon
Pray that it ain’t too soon
