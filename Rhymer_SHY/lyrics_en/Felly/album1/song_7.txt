[Verse 1: Felly]
Im always waking up to sirens
Yo pack it, pass it
Anything to close these eyelids
Yo boy trynna bloom like Iris
Someone better strap me up I'm going loco
Wishing i could be back local
Back in '04 mom's Volvo
Yo my days now they move slo-mo
Killing times kicking rocks on that corner
Im lawless with no order
Trynna be flawless my a order
Shoot like comets straight towards you (please)
Remove your hands imm tryna breathe
Like fuck this class im trynna dream
Got what it takes they still don't believe
But know I got a couple tricks up my sleeve
High like the seats on a rover
This is life bro I sleep when its over
Have a little bit of weed with the cobra
Won't stop till im deep in a coma
I be who I wanna
Low-key you know me
I keep it rocking like ocean
I slit my wrists and its golden
All I know is I know this
That it's

[Hook: Felly]
All gon' be straight
I ain't tripping bro its all gon' be straight
(all gon' be straight)
So mind your business bro its all gon' be straight
(all gon' be straight)
Like why not i said its all gon' be straight
(all gon' be straight)
Like why a lot

[Verse 2: Felly]
From the north
(from the north)
To the south
(to the south)
Im off like labor day
And i hate to say
But yo please can you shut your mouth
From the east
(from the east)
To the west
Fresh dress off a little bit of west
Till I bench press
Cold shit type of shit leave the bed wet
Said its depressing
(straight depressing)
Straight depressing how we moving
I wake up and count my loses
Still i swear Im never losing
This that g shit
For those who don't kill
Speak shit until my throat ill
Get seasick i got boat [?]
Yo jesus we move so ill
I ain't trying be concerned
When these people tangle my nerves
Yo im lethal you got my word
My cerebral it move absurd
Back when I was sweeping floors
And just keying to open doors
Lets believe in something more
No excuses take the world
Damn
Fel move through on the ones and twos
Letting hell break lose
Smoking L's on stoops
Never misconstrue what the kid gonna do
Movin corners groove to groove
(thats groove to groove)
Up and down like 2 on 2s
Still vibin
And thats great
Same old CT shit with less mistakes
Home set the bar let me lift the weight
I said

[Hook]
