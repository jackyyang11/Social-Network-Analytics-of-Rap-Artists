[Verse:]
Few days at the bottom
On the top feel better, got a world full of problems
Hold me down, I escape the column
Pray to god, but I praise the dollar
I'm driftin' farther
From a brain that used to bother me constantly
Am I lit on right? and I properly spit prophecy
Better than I was the last time, reminiscin' on the pain of bad times
Throw a little jazz though phat rhymes
We washed up like bath time
Pack it up, this the shit you play when you had enough
Smokin' in the car, got a ash and cups
Feel soo sad, but I'm happy as fuck
Said I used to wanna be on the TV screens
Eazy- E, playin' on my walk, man, mp3
Tryna find a way to breath easy, but that shit won't happen
So I started rappin' to pass time and hopefully
In a few years I'll be globally
Recognized by those who feel dopamine
Every time I hit the mic, I spit soulfully
[?]
Damn I feel alive like the chosen one
Cuz all my friends 'round here they roll their blunts
And I love to smoke, but get your goals and run

[Hook:](x2)
Y'all standin' still and I can't stand it
It's cool, the world yours, I'll take the other 7 planets

[Outro:]
On some bigger shit, ight, we're done
