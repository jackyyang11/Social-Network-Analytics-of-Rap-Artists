[Hook]
When the truth come out and the river runs dry
I don't care if you got a man cause you're so damn fine
Something so wrong, make it feel so right
You've been a bad gurl, You've been a bad gurl
Fuck yo girls, I'm gonna fuck you good
Put it on the set girl, that's my hood
Your girls, they know what you probably should
You've been a bad gurl, You've been a bad gurl

[Verse 1]
Rollin' through my hood
Got her on my mind
Probably shouldn't but I would if I could slide through
Imma put it down like no other white boy do
Shorty you bad though
Don't ever let em tell em' 'bout yourself cause they want you
He's just standing on you
Why does your man ignore you?
He's supposed to be your man, what the fuck he hating on you for?
God damn!

[Hook]
When the truth come out and the river runs dry
I don't care if you got a man cause you're so damn fine
Something so wrong, make it feel so right
You've been a bad gurl, You've been a bad gurl
Fuck yo girls, I'm gonna fuck you good
Put it on the set girl, that's my hood
Your girls, they know what you probably should
You've been a bad gurl, You've been a bad gurl

[Verse 2]
Girl, we've been hiding we've been keeping on the down low
Imma take it, Imma hit it slow motion
I could take ya, take ya anywhere that you wanna go
On the yacht, imma take ya to the ocean
All of my dogs tell me leave you alone
Promise to stop trippin' boy you was wrong
But we know this on our own
Yeah we know, yeah we know

[Bridge]
What I say?
What I say?
What I say?
I play no games
You see who has taught me my ways
I don't care 'bout what they say so
It's fuck what they say

[Hook]
When the truth come out and the river runs dry
I don't care if you got a man cause you're so damn fine
Something so wrong, make it feel so right
You've been a bad gurl, You've been a bad gurl
Fuck yo girls, I'm gonna fuck you good
Put it on the set girl, that's my hood
Your girls, they know what you probably should
You've been a bad gurl, You've been a bad gurl

[Outro]
Shorty I know you've been looking for a real one
Someone who could pay the money when the bills come
You've been a bad gurl
You been a bad girl
Oh yeah, oh yeah
