[Verse 1]
Hop up in the party
Flashin' like I'm grand master
Shawty in the back
But I'm swervin' right past her
[?]
[?]
But she can get mad
When we ridin' in the Casper
Chop a bat off, to a man
Damn that's fucked up
Feelin' like a rascal
I'm just tryna get my club up
Will she just
Let me do whatever like I'm [?]
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold one
If you say you're really for one

[Hook]
Call my, call my, call my phone
She won't leave me alone
I been' workin' like a mo'
Gotta get it on my own
Had to get it on your own
Cause they never was your bros
Call my, call my, call my phone
They won't leave me alone
Call my, call my, call my phone
She won't leave me alone
I been' workin' like a mo'
Gotta get it on my own
Had to get it on your own
Cause they never was your bros
Call my, call my, call my phone
They won't leave me alone

[Verse 2]
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold one
Homie chefin' like a shogun
Strong arms like they show guns
High arms like they flow, uh
They ain't mad 'cause we show one
To be on one you gotta cost one
To cost one you gotta boss up
Hit the dentist's then I floss up
You mad 'cause you still in the city
And others had to make it out
We get the paper, I been on the route
Throwin' magazines, on the magazine, yeah
I'm the one you readin' about
Fuck your opinion, that's sleep on your mouth
Middle cut with a therapist, let it all out
My third eye is open, I sit back and scout, yeah

[Hook]
Call my, call my, call my phone
She won't leave me alone
I been' workin' like a mo'
Gotta get it on my own
Had to get it on your own
Cause they never was your bros
Call my, call my, call my phone
They won't leave me alone
Call my, call my, call my phone
She won't leave me alone
I been' workin' like a mo'
Gotta get it on my own
Had to get it on your own
Cause they never was your bros
Call my, call my, call my phone
They won't leave me alone
