[Intro]
Feedback back for your bad ass, yeah
As you witness I'm surrounded by 2 more emcees outta my war council
My Rottweiler of Rhymes B-Wyze a.k.a. Blast
Introducing my Doberman of Destruction, Lyrical Destroyer
Dow Jonz a.k.a. John Connor Of Moruturi
My war council comin' smashin' through battle zones of microphones
Whatever goes, whatever goes, whatever goes

[Verse 1: Dow Jonz]
Yo, my man, the rhymes I write, they be the illest
And I be fucking up careers like those of Arnold, Kimberly and Willis
You'll take the penicillin, Run DMC & Jay say I be illin'
My crew ain't juicy, I am not cold chillin'
I'm a super villain, I'd even room with Dr. Doom and we'd be killin
I'd rip a bitch in London just for one shilling
I'm on your cable, channel X I'm causing strife
But it make me wanna holler, son, the way they do my life
Check it!
Executives in suites eat dinner and discuss
How I can make more for us, whenever I bust
I step forth from the jungle in fatigues
The everglades, canteen full of liquor
I'm sitting on grenades
Little women squirming from the 12th down to 11th grades
When they peep me in the magazine
Upon they wall they stick the page
But you're too young I'll take you mom
And shacked from shells and bombs
Uncle Sam make brothers Uncle Toms in Vietnam

[Hook]

[Verse 2: B-Wyze]
Yo, it's A Low Down Dirty Shame
How I'm Surviving The Game to get the Glory
Son this ain't no West Side Story
Who's The Man that started with the Boyz In Da Hood
And The Five Heartbeats, he would Shuffle Hollywood
Could it be the King Of New York
Up in the lights form them days in Crooklyn
To them Harlem Nights
In this New Jack City, I'm the man with the Juice
Meet me Uptown Saturday Night, Bustin' Loose
The Mack, The Black Caesar, and if She's Gotta Have It
Im'ma Do The Right Thing and please her
Her man got a death wish cause he wanna fight
But I hold a Lethal Weapon on Judgement Night
Yo bring it on, MC's ain't ready for the battle
My Posse will leave you Sleepless In Seattle
48 Hours of nuttin' but Tales From The Hood
Gimme Dead Presidents Fella, cause I'm Good

[Hook]

[Bridge]
One more time
YO this aaa KSUF...
And I am your only trackman
That like to think ???? been in my life, oh shit
Motherfuckers is so bitch, he brake it on
And aaah... I wanna hear Dow Jones
Ey yo Chuck, Chuck
How you doin man ?
You got your back off, and B-wyze
So he straight shit doin man
C'mon c'mon

[Verse 3: Dow Jonz]
God damn, like the 85'ers eat the ham
I'll eat up weak MC's and that means shorty and his man
My name is Dow from the clique about to die
Others call me John Connor and perhaps
I'll tell the reason why
While Hiroshima blackens up the sky
I will lounge inside my shelter as you fry
As you're incinerated
I'll come around again forget me not
I had to shine with darkness for a minute
That was hot

[Verse 4: Chuck D]
Semen in a women from the men without hats
Get your life split up like some Kit-Kats
I seem to be triple teamed
By gang green who don't listen
Bluntz them must be hittin
(can?t read) emission
I stress the position
At the top of the slop
Crackas be droppin a lot
Like saltines out the box
I despise singin songs in the low rider duckin cynics
Fuck 'em and those Johnny-come-critics
