[Intro]
Can I tell my side of a street nigga yeah
Yeah oh
Can I tell my side

[Verse 1]
On the block from 9 to 5 we getting paper in the middle of the jungle with that burner on me
For them long nights we grind cause we had nothing
Look I just want that money stuff them hundreds on me
My partner lost his mind when he switched sides
Now he crossed the line
But I just want that bread and niggas want me dead (Yeah)
Give a fuck bout what they said I'm yelling "Fuck the rest"
Its like they wanna take from me
Ever since that I came they putting dirt on my name
In public they don't say nothing
Cause they know I'm with the shits, this 40 came with a dick head
Came up from nothing from that two piece of chicken but
Niggas I love they hate the fact that I'm getting rich
But what goes around comes around
Gotta watch my back cause they plotting to gun me down
I'm going through this day after day
I kept it real with you bitches I would've killed for my niggas
Its funny how people change on me
And this the story of my life cross my heart and hope to die

[Hook]
And I
Ima keep it gangsta till the day I die
And I
Could never be a snitch without no paperwork they tellin lies
And nigga this time
Oh I'm pullin up its homicide, ima shut it down
And I
Know they gone hate on 3 for whatever

[Verse 2]
They think they be playing crazy
Boy fuck that lil 380 FNN in my jeans
When I unload shoot this bitch and aim it yelling "fuck who and all they came with" hope they die that's on me
And bitch its homicide when I get out
Just don't testify
Niggas plot on me get shot in they sleep solo mission I'm gone
Give a fuck who rock with 3 all I got is me I did this shit on my own
They say you wrong, that nigga did it
Niggas ain't getting it how they say they living
Sound like a bitch and some messy hoe business
Won't catch me riding with a messy hoe with me
Its a collision
Love my religion
Elijah Muhammad tell Allah I'm with it
Due to the fact that my heart is so wicked
Break on a bitch I got hoes on restriction (Hey)

[Hook]
And I
Ima keep it gangsta till the day I die
And I
Could never be a snitch without no paperwork they tellin lies
And nigga this time
Oh I'm pullin up its homicide, ima shut it down
And I
Know they gone hate on 3 for whatever
