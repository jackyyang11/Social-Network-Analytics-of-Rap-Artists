My mama stayed in the church
Granny make sure we was there every Sunday
On the block I was raised by the worst
So much pain the shit made me hurt
Came a long way from slangin that work
Still put a niggahs face on the shirt
Young niggah came from the dirt
My granny gave me to the church
I bought that bitch a new purse
Push start the whip it's go skirt
?
Pack out the pack it was wrap out the wrap
It didn't matter which ever came first
Young niggah take 'em to church so I gotta take 'em to church

Yeah 3 I can't help the way that I'm feeling
Right now niggah worth a couple of million
Gotta grind just to get it my ? So relentlessly
From the gutter the struggle my enemy
I had to scratch for the check it's ridiculous

Got on my knees and this what I prayed for
I told God to bless my bankroll
And I shall shine and flex on these fuck niggahs
And I shall ? With these stank hoes
I ran up my ? No amigos no ? El chapo Diego
My feet cost a kilo que pasa this choppa this my bike I'm debo
They told me I'm losing they lost me like nemo
All my shooters shoot Uzi no free throw ?
That quapo I'm copo want cheddar no Cheetos
They plot on the profit I watch through the peep hole I see 'em

My mama stayed in the church
Granny make sure we was there every Sunday
On the block I was raised by the worst
So much pain the shit made me hurt
Came a long way from slangin that work
Still put a niggahs face on the shirt
Young niggah came from the dirt
My granny gave me to the church
Push start the coupe it go skirt
I drop a band in her purse wondering if it's gon work
Pack out the pack it was wrap out the wrap
It didn't matter which ever came first
Young niggah take 'em to church
So I gotta take 'em to church

Saturday night going live
Known early that morning when Sunday came I gotta be up
Sleepy then a bitch phone ringing needa re-up
But the plug wanna text I'm trying to who got it cheaper
Lord forgive me for that gun I had in that church house
On the back road
It was on Mother's Day I'm at the fellowship
In hp with Blake yeah I'm strapped up (I really was foreal)
?
I fantasize about the keys by the water
I was just a baby when they took me to the alter
My granny used to say baby pray and be smarter
I grind like I got but no son and no daughter
Young niggah I was blessed to be the best and be in charge
I could've been dead but instead I went harder

I never smoked weed but I gun smoke
My mama know that I'm cut-throat
Used to wanna play the drums in church
Until I bought chips with a whole drum roll
Bout a band what a niggah thumb through
Baby wanna kick it no Kung fu
I raise my hand up to God
Cause he bought that new coupe outside

My mama stayed in the church
Granny make sure we was there every Sunday
On the block I was raised by the worst
So much pain the shit made me hurt
Came a long way from slangin that work
Still put a niggahs face on the shirt
Young niggah came from the dirt
My granny gave me to the church
I bought that bitch a new purse
Push start the whip it go skirt
?
Pack out the pack it was wrap out the wrap
Didn't matter which ever came first
Young niggah take 'em to church
So I gotta take 'em to church
