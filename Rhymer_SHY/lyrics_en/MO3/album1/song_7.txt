[Chorus]
Hold your tongue 'cause you might say somethin' I might not like
And if you do then you just might lose your life tonight
My big brother told me never let a nigga fuck me
And if I don't, he'll never let a nigga touch me
Niggas better not come half-stepping
'Cause we got something that'll speed you up
And watch them hollow points eat you up
Nigga what? you can't touch me
So I advise you niggas don't try to fuck me

[Verse 1]
You can't bang with a beast, gun slang on a lane with a G
Quarter thing of cocaine in the seat
Everything that I speak real deal, I'll burn a nigga up
Make 'em put a nigga name on they T
S-H-I-R-T, T-R-I-L-L
Hollow tips they'll sang him to sleep
Cut a nigga body up, dump it in the lake
Let it float off and then bring that flame to his street
You niggas ain't really no gangstas
You niggas bitches who walk around claiming to be
Something you not, I'll go and put that thang to his teeth
Knock 'em out, now he can't even eat
Got him chewing out a straw bitch, on that raw shit
I'm a dog, make him lean when I aim with the heat
Fuck the law, still creep when I crawl like a hog
But up north we dumb, no brains, don't think
We won't retaliate on your whole la familia
Gatling gun will fill him up and then hit the rest
Hear that chainsaw, yeah (grrr)
That's the sound of the blade when it rip through a bitch nigga flesh
Knock his face off, lip to the left
Chrome TEC put a dip in his chest
His face all fucked up, six in his vest
Grab his head, put a twist to his neck
Now that boy body built like a desk

[Chorus]
Hold your tongue 'cause you might say somethin' I might not like
And if you do then you just might lose your life tonight
My big brother told me never let a nigga fuck me
And if I don't, he'll never let a nigga touch me
Niggas better not come half-stepping
'Cause we got something that'll speed you up
And watch them hollow points eat you up
Nigga what? you can't touch me
So I advise you niggas don't try to fuck me

[Verse 2]
I'm from the nuddy lil buddy, thirteen-oh-thirty
Lurkin', them young niggas dirty
Pull up on the curb, shirt be, tucked in my pants
So the burner won't hurt while I'm servin'
Come to the lane, gun in my hand like Cain
With them mob niggas, movin' them birdies
I'm from the lane, Forest Lane, gang bang, slang cane
Get twisted up like a McFlurry
Dum-dah-dah-dum-dum-dum
Choppers on deck ho, yoppers on top of that expo
Pa-rup-a-pa-pup-a-pum-pum
A hundred round drum''ll knock a bitch nigga up outta them retros
Bah-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum
Lets go, tell him ready set go
Check got te TECs on decks by the jets ho
Fuck 'round and let go, one through your neck ho
Like Chief said if you half steppin' (what?)
Lil Three tote somethin' that'll eat you up
And the casket ain't shi
And them hoes in the cemetery be deep as fuck
Two-two-three when I'm creepin' up
If you shoot me we gon' beef it up
This the north ho, don't get knocked off though

[Chorus]
Hold your tongue 'cause you might say somethin' I might not like
And if you do then you just might lose your life tonight
My big brother told me never let a nigga fuck me
And if I don't, he'll never let a nigga touch me
Niggas better not come half-stepping
'Cause we got something that'll speed you up
And watch them hollow points eat you up
Nigga what? you can't touch me
So I advise you niggas don't try to fuck me
