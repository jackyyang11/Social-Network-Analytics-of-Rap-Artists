Im in my feelings
That shit fuck me up, I can't lie nigga
Imma Tell the truth anyway

My uncle smokin dope inside the kitchen
My bitch fucked another nigga
That hurt my feelings
So when I fuck another hoe, I make sure they feel like
All in they kidneys, ask yo bitch
Know I’m that nigga
Ain't seen my niggas in a minute
They took that sentence
Fuck the judge and the jury
They hurt my feelings
They don't understand the way a young nigga livin
Get out my business lil bitch
Get out yo feelings lil nigga

Hop in the whip
Cut up and zoom off
Billy Jean, Micheal Jackson lil nigga
Look at this moonwalk
Ya hoe better cool off
For I pull that tool out
Diamond chains, some racks on my neck like part of the jewel house
Really lovin and I’m really thuggin
I got shooters that do what I say
My partner told he was gone kill me
All I did was pray
If that's yo nigga, then look yo nigga should not ever say
That he gone take yo life away but I guess we ain't the same
I took a charge for one my niggas he didn't give me a thang
I loved a bitch who ain't do shit for me but give me some pain
I let y'all eat my mama food
I showed y'all where I stay
Got locked in chains, I kept my mouth closed
I didn't say no names

Now you tellin them bitches
"That nigga broke and he ain’t gettin it"
I can’t lie, that hurt my feelings
And listen
When I was locked up, you didn't make no visits
I try to lie like I really wasn’t tripping
But I?

My uncle smokin dope inside the kitchen
My bitch fucked another nigga
That hurt my feelings
So when I fuck another hoe, I make sure they feel like
All in they kidneys, ask yo bitch
Know I'm that nigga
Ain't seen my mugged in a minute they took that sentence
Fuck the judge and the jury
They hurt my feelings
They don't understand the way a young nigga livin
Get out my business lil bitch
Get out yo feelings lil nigga

Have you ever gave your last $20 to a nigga that love
That same nigga you call your partner, talk about you, drag your name through the mud
I feel neglected, disrespected, must I mention
Thats yo best friend, I fuck yo best friend
That’s my business
She was watching, she was?? she was??
So why she snitching, this hoe trippin
Got you ignorant
When I got? the judge told me
"boy you not gone see the light of day"
4 indictments in one week
The devil he tryna take my smile away
They hoped that I was?
She did me wrong, gotta put my pride away
My feelings, yeah I'm all in em
So I gotta fix it, forgive em
They try not to hate

Solo, I'm whippin lil nigga
I'm chasin them benjis (I'm chasing them racks)
Pussy nigga wanna kill me, I see it
Tell the nigga, that I feel it. (I Feel it)
I walk em down in the trenches (I do it)
Kill a nigga, fuck the witness (for real)
This the way a nigga feelin
This the way a nigga livin

My uncle smokin dope inside the kitchen
My bitch fucked another nigga, that hurt my feelings
So when I fuck another hoe, I make sure they feel like
All in they kidneys, ask yo bitch know I'm that nigga
Ain't seen my mugged in a minute the took that sentence
Fuck the judge and the jury, they hurt my feelings
