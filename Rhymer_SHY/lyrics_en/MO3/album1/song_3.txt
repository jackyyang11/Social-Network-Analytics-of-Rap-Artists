(intro)
Why the fuck these niggas wanna go against the grain
Why the fuck these niggas wanna drag a nigga name
Ay..
True story
Oo

(First Verse)
I know some niggas who hurt me (they hurt me)
A couple bitches who hurt me (they hurt me)
The jury don't want me to make it (make it)
The DA I know that he working (oh he working)
Prosecutors wanna hound me (what)
I'm hoping they don't do me dirty (do me dirty)
This 40 I got that bitch dirty (bow)
Shoota on go , he shoot perfect (what)
I gotta hunnid on me (on me)
The devil write me in my sleep (oh he do)
I break a bitch in a week, lil bitch im not what you think (nah)
I stood in the field with my Hittas, I kept that rocket on me (I do)
Hate that I had to get rid of my niggas, I heard they was plottin on me (oh its true)
For the love of money, my homies they turned they backs
Same niggas that still owe me on the pack say they got jack me
My closest friends , I knew since we were kids, say they gone whack me
But Ian lien, I'm slanging nine
&' bitch they know that , so get at me

(Chorus x2)
Everybody ain't yo friend
Everybody ain't yo partna
Everybody ain't no real nigga , if I say I got you
When its fucked up, gets fucked up, just hold it down and keep it solid
&' when you not around , I protect yo name
I won't let a nigga talk about you

(Verse 2)
I would've killed for you niggas (niggas)
Now I can't deal with you niggas (I can't)
Talking to the grim reaper
Finna get rid of you niggas (uh)
So sick of these niggas ( I am )
Claiming they hittas and killas (they not)
Showing out for them bitches
Flexing on Instagram pictures (you ah dub)
Put it on my life on my momma we gone be straight (yeahhh yeah)
My partna looked me in my face before I took that case (and what he do)
Then the nigga turned snake
Other homie turned snake (he pussy)
But I kept it real with these niggas
How could they do me that way (yeah)
I was broke den a bitch , so I'm hustling
I'm on my grind yeah (on my grind yeah)
Worked my way up to a quarter pound , selling dime bags (dime bags)
Spent 250 for the sheeps (sheeps)
This thunder cooked em , he In the leaps
My niggas hit me for some zips (he did)
Shouldn't showed him where it is (fuck)

(Chorus x2)
Everybody ain't yo friend
Everybody ain't yo partna
Everybody ain't no real nigga , if I say I got you
When its fucked up, gets fucked up, just hold it down and keep it solid
&' when you not around , I protect yo name
I won't let a nigga talk about you

(outro)
Have you ever gave yo last twenty dollars to a nigga that you love
And that same nigga you call yo partna talk about you , drag yo name thru the mud
