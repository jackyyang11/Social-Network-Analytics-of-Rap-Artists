VERSE 1
I wanna know your name
Give a fuck about your boyfriend
Lemme be yo toy friend
Only for one day
Tonight imma show you what I call a first lay
Come on in close the door turn the music off
I feel your hands on my face
& we don't got to say whats been said
Just open your legs and imma go direct
& every time you put your tongue on me
I feel like imma need a chance to breath
I feel it running coming down your knees
Feeling kinda sticky kinda hard for you to get me off
& I ain tripping cause I wanna see
If you a freak and can you handle it deep
Climb on top and ride me like a G
Feel like we thuggin' when we fucking
But its nothing no discussion
I can make it cloudy (that's when you feel that water)
Running down your body (we don't need a bottle)
Get on top and ride me  (ready here we go)
You must want a carpet burn cause we get fucking on the floor

CHOURS
Show me what it's made of
Real street nigga girl ain none of this made up
Your sex is contagious, head game crazy
I know you got a nigga and I got an old lady
So show me what its made of
Show me what it's made of
You can keep your feelings bitch I ain tryna save ya
Imma replace ya I don't want no relation
I know my dick good girl lets keep it gangsta
