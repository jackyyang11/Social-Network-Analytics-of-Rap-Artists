[Intro: Mo3]
Came a long way from nothin'
I mean a long, long, long way
Now we up nigga
Got a bag on you niggas, for real

[Chorus: Mo3]
Hundreds (hundreds), fifties (fifties)
Twenties (twenties), tens (oh yeah)
Hundreds (hundreds), fifties (fifties)
Twenties (twenties), tens (woo)
I was broke out of luck (I was)
Ran it up, got it up (up)
I used to sleep on the floor (the floor)
Now them hoes wanna fuck (gang)
Hundreds (hundreds), fifties (fifties)
Twenties (twenties), tens (a-whoa)
Hundreds (hundreds), fifties (fifties)
Twenties (twenties), tens (yee)
I like a bitch big butt (I do)
Big old booty, she a slut (freak)
Bitch ain't no drank in my cup (woo)
I'm the man, nigga what?

[Verse 1: Mo3]
[?] baby with the Levis on, eatin' top cat (I was)
These old rap niggas hatin', y'all need to stop that (y'all need to stop that shit)
In that AMG-550 strapped with that glocky (I'm strapped)
I'm in a 9-11, feet cocked up with that top back (yeah yeah)
I used to wait one twenty-five in timber lies (on a deal, yeah)
Now the scale say two-oh-five and the whip I drive it'll kill you (skkrt)
Twenty-five thousand dollars worth of jewelry on me, feelin' like Thriller
I used to stand outside for the bus, now I drive the Porsche like a four wheeler (skrrt)
Sold all the pounds (the pounds)
We sold all the grams (I sold all them grams)
I was a project appointment baby
Now bitch I'm the man (it's time to group)
I stood in the spot, I had nowhere to go, used to sleep out a fan (slurp out a fan)
On God I was broke, I was lookin' for hope, you do not understand (no)
But I ran it up to go get them

[Chorus: Mo3]
Hundreds (hundreds), fifties (fifties)
Twenties (twenties), tens (yeah)
Hundreds (hundreds), fifties (fifties)
Twenties (twenties), tens (yee)
I was broke out of luck (I was)
Ran it up, got it up (the check)
I used to sleep on the floor (the floor)
Now them hoes wanna fuck (woo)
Hundreds (hundreds), fifties (fifties)
Twenties (twenties), tens (a-whoa)
Hundreds (hundreds), fifties (fifties)
Twenties (twenties), tens (yee)
I like a bitch big butt (I do)
Big old booty, she a slut (freak)
Bitch ain't no drank in my cup (woo)
I'm the man, nigga what?

[Verse 2: Moneybagg Yo]
I used to sleep on the floor (I did)
Now it's twenty for a show (big money)
I used to pull kick doors (I did)
Now it's foreign doors when I close, yeah (skrrt skrrt)
I used to trap out apartments (I did)
I was so broke, I was robbin' (I was fucked up)
I was so broke, I was starvin' (I was starvin')
Now they label me a target (real talk)
Money coming in so fast (what?)
These niggas think I ain't count mine (deal it)
If I catch a nigga stealing one time (what you gon' do?)
Off with his head, flat line (blaow)
I don't give a fuck about 'em, y'all read about 'em
I don't care 'bout no strife nigga (I don't care 'bout his ass)
You would probably think a nigga was hurtin' (what?)
Way I'm covered in ice nigga (hey, hey)
Instagram, get your bitch out my likes nigga (get your ho)
'Fore I send her a flight nigga ('fore I fly her out)
Walk in Neimans, we don't care 'bout the price nigga (ugh ugh)
Get that back in one night nigga (ugh, whatever)
Hunchos, fifties (fifties)
Twenties, I don't got no tens in (I don't got that)
I ran it up, ran it up, ran it up (ugh ugh ugh)
Had to get right, Lorenz in (hey)

[Chorus: Mo3]
Hundreds (hundreds), fifties (fifties)
Twenties (twenties), tens (yeah)
Hundreds (hundreds), fifties (fifties)
