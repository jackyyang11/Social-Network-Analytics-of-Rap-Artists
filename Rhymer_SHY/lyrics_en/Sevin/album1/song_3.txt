Hmph
Check
Now you could turn my mic up just a teeny lil bit
Check, check
Ugh, yeah, right there

Yeah, ugh. It’s not a game
And it’s not for the real ones, you know?
I feel you
There will be no questions
Ugh

[Verse 1: Sevin]
Flippin' repetitious with the sickness
Spit this with the swiftness
Ever put a dent in the game
All that's representin' stand and mention his name
Get bridged with a flame
Only ballin with the callin I was sent with the same
I will forever be too clever for the flesh debate
Walkin with the father so you know the rest gone hate
And for any that be feelin they could test the faith
We devastate
Never resuscitate, at least stop if they blessed or great
Whatcha really need to do is kill the blasphemy
Only with full passion please your majesty
It’s the same within my faculty
He’s the reason why we breezin by, fast and free
Ain’t no carnal livin, driven up surpassin me
So you betta come with the truth if ya askin me
Who the faction be
Spittin venom like a spider
Should I surprise ya
That I’m bangin the Messiah like it has to be
I was empowered when the coward took a blast at me
Homie you couldn’t close casket me
To the loose women in ‘Gucc linen
That be tryin ta make a pass at me
You ain’t attractin me
So you might as well walk right past a G
Ain’t playin when I’m sayin that I cain’t get touched
If you cain’t spit, hush
If it ain’t about Christ then ya ain’t wit us

[Hook: Sevin]
This is for life, Ugh
Just so ya’ll know that’s how it be
The Holy God empowers me
I’ll never spit it cowardly
This is for life
They couldn’t conceal us if they tried to
I came to supply you
With the wisdom to ride to

[Verse 2: Sevin]
Similar to cockin' back a Glock-9 -RUSH
When the vocab thrusts, and if I bust you
I trust that I can stop time
Never met a beat that I couldn’t defeat
Speeds trigger heat, you’re getting deep into the celsius heat
I’m make em geek like a lost mind, steppin over the cross-line
Welcome the beginnin' of the end of the trend
And sportin' God’s shine
Holy siders with the lost find
I’m havin' visions of Christ upon the cross dyin
Supernatural seduction, the percussion got me lustin'
Compose a introduction of demonic destruction
The bigga the figga the sicka the scripture
I’m quicker to trust in
Plus when dwellin in the realm of resurrection
Open casket doors
A nothin’ skull bone spiritually full grown
Crucifixion is kissin a mission
Sharpen dull stones during drastic wars
They really ain’t got nothin for me to gain
I’m painless eternal so show me some pain
Invoking the brain, ???????????? came
Young Sevin, notorious name
Too cold to contain
Sacrificial now spills trails of blood
All the Messiah inhales is love
And I’m walkin on water like a velvet glove

[Hook: Sevin]
This is for life, Ugh
Just so ya’ll know that’s how it be
The Holy God empowers me
I’ll never spit it cowardly
This is for life
They couldn’t conceal us if they tried to
I came to supply you
With the wisdom to ride to

[Verse 3: Sevin]
And I came to bring the game with the features to clown
Only so called preachers around
Anything I speak will abound
The deeper the game, the steeper the ground
Throw your hands where I can see em
If you seek then you’re found
California’s where I creep with the crown
HOG LIFE I get deep in the town
The righteous live eternal
But the weakest seek and they drown
Six feet deep in the ground you’re peepin it now
Sown death but you’re reapin it now
Repercussion fool you’re keepin it foul
Satan ain’t a menace if you really peepin him out
As for Christ, are you seekin him out? No?
Then there ain’t nothin for you to be grievin about
Came to settle the score homie, you’re leavin him out
Don’t get ta actin like you don’t know what I’m speakin about
Cuz I be dippin through the section
While I’m beatin it out, speakin it out
I’m speakin it loud, and speakin it proud
I’m hearin that they seekin me out
Why? Without a single blink of a doubt
I be so full of the Word to the point that if you cut me
I’ll be leakin it out
Never will I come weak with it now
Lemme slow it down, this ain’t even my style
Ugh, they wanna speak on how deep I get
But they wouldn’t be sayin nothin if I was frontin
Bout money and women and the weed I hit
Or the dirt I did and the heat I…. Spit
They wanna slander my name cuz
I’ve endangered the game by comin righteous
Knowin that ain’t nobody gon' come again like this
Let em know if they Christless, they lifeless
If not homie, ya priceless
I’m in ya dome like lice is
There’s no reason to fight this
It’s futile tryin ta bite this
So I hit ya wit a slight twist
You gots ta live just to write this

[Hook: Sevin]
This is for life, Ugh
Just so ya’ll know that’s how it be
The Holy God empowers me
I’ll never spit it cowardly
This is for life
They couldn’t conceal us if they tried to
I came to supply you
