Got a hold on me like no one before
When you're by my side I'm not alive, I'm so much more
Ooo girl ain't nothing ever gonna take me from your arms I swear
Through the good, the bad, the joy, the saddness I will be there

I'm forever yours, girl you don't have to wait for your love
I'm forever yours, you can just shower me from above
I'm forever yours, girl you don't have to wait for your love
I'm forever yours.... I'm forever yours... Oooo
