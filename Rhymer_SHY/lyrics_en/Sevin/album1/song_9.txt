[Chorus]
Man up stand up
Ain't ashamed to put them hands
They plan to ban us
But yea I'm a christian and what
(x4)

[Verse 1: Sevin]
Bossy man and we off the chain
Sizzling he often flames
Still the king and the cross he bang
Until the guillotine rip of me brain
Ain't spitting no salty game
They really want to off me man
They peeling with faulty aim
Still in the grill like coffee stains
Stomping on anything tripling sixes
Looking for something a little different, this is
The spit is just vicious, sicker than syphilis
Hands down point blank it is ridiculous
I used to be a typical misfit
Now I pray to the same one I'm getting my chips with
It's just like whipping a biscuit
And I ain't talking dipping a dipstick in a pitcher of Bisquik
Yup, and roll my street, heavily Chevrolet slow mob creep
About four five deep, and we sho got sheep
And you know I eat, what I sow I reap
Hogged out and i ain't changing it either
I hang in the streets with a gang of believers
Getting green like a corn stalk
I was born hot like I came with a fever
Jesus Christ protect me tonight
I'm trying to prove your life
In the war I freedom fight
Soldiers glowin' like beacon lights
Yup, I'm making dough
But I ain't going to get my cake and go
You can hate but don't mistake it bro
He favored us to save a soul

[Verse 2: Sevin]
So saucy so real, so contagious so ill
More than basic the skill, rolling space ships on wheels
Motivating the tracks, home invasion on wax
Ya'll done played with the rap but Jehovah's taking it back
I fish so I sent the lure, this is a mental cure
Got to keep my temple pure
Let me check my temperature
Seven hundred and seventy seven degrees
You never met a predator well brother its better to leave
I'm eating everything ain't right
Don't come around here if your game ain't tight
My men are pure with the flame they light
Many of them minister to gain they stripes
Campaigning to change they life
Can't hang with the gang if the name ain't Christ
If its about the rock then I'm with them
Seek out the flock and I'll get'em
If you ever want to stop the devil up in his plot
All you got to do is pop the lock and I'll hit him
I ain't timid I be flipping through the different Apostles
On a mission just to give them the Gospel
The Son is the great one mister colossal
When it comes to the faith I'm stiff as a fossil
I'm a praise him any ole where you can sit in your chair
Man I really don't care
I bang you won't, Christ reigns you don't

[Chorus]
