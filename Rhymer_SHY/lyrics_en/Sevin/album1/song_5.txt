What? (lettin' em know)
It’s Young Hog Soldier Sevin a.k.a. The Full Clip
Next Gen. Ministry Records baby.. c'mon

[Sevin]
Ain’t never been known for no chit chat
I see Satan, I click clack
As a Christian I’m in position for this get back
I get to trippin' in the spirit spittin' lyrics
Till I know the Lord can hear it hittin' harder than some crit nack
Sevin spit that, the Holy Spirit anoints the sick track
Hog Life I’m with that, till the day I’m on my big nap
Called in for revival down in sick Sac
Then chose the ropes to rip that
Till I witnessed Satan’s quit crap
And that’s just so ya know for show for show blow for blow
Anything I spit is frostbitten just like The Poconos
The devil don’t wanna start this
I get to swarmin' just like flies on a carcass
Detestin' the enemy I’m detectin'
Get all up in they intestine just like a C-section
So learn your lesson, and vacate the session
There’s no penetration, his head to protection
What
Cuz my God is almighty
So hooked on his love is all I be
Uh, So I suggest that ya’ll ride with me
Cuz this will be until the day I R.I.P

Chorus:
Where My soldiers at?
We right here
Where my warriors at?
We right here
Where my HOGS at?
We right here
We right here
We right here
Where My soldiers at?
We right here
Where my warriors at?
We right here
Where my HOGS at?
We right here
We right here
We right here

What we got?
Nine hundred and sixteen ways to praise the Lord
Straight from Sactown fittin' ta put the crackdown
All the believers raise your sword
You know
Nine hundred and sixteen ways to praise the Lord
Straight from Sactown fittin' ta put the crackdown
All the believers raise your sword
C'mon
Nine hundred and sixteen ways to praise the Lord
Straight from Sactown fittin' ta put the crackdown
All the believers raise your sword
Ride with me
Nine hundred and sixteen ways to praise the Lord
Straight from Sactown fittin' ta put the crackdown
All the believers raise your sword

[Sevin]
It don’t matter what ya heard
Flippin a verse
Strictly my click be sickly spittin' the word
Ain’t sippin' on syrup or hittin' the herb
Aggression be flexin the lesson is strippin' your nerve
From the heart, sharpen the steel that was set in his hand
Feel the end that be floodin' this land
Contraband I credit his plan
Composition for verbal emission, steadily twistin' the opposition
Against the mission for righteous infliction
Holy addiction’s too wild
Vindication and Satan’s hatin' this salvation - father’s creation
Declaratin' the indignation hes got for this nation is futile
Word distilled... now never let it ever be said you ain’t heard the real
Preparation’s somewhat of a meal be delivered straight to your grill
Do you feel we off the map like this and you know we gone make it crack like this
Saturate the track like this, we spit the game straight from Sac like this

Chorus:
Where My soldiers at?
We right here
Where my warriors at?
We right here
Where my HOGS at?
We right here
We right here
We right here
Where My soldiers at?
We right here
Where my warriors at?
We right here
Where my HOGS at?
We right here
We right here
We right here

What we got?
Nine hundred and sixteen ways to praise the Lord
Straight from Sactown fittin' ta put the crackdown

You know

C'mon
Nine hundred and sixteen ways to praise the Lord
Straight from Sactown fittin' ta put the crackdown

Ride with me
Nine hundred and sixteen ways to praise the Lord
Straight from Sactown fittin' ta put the crackdown
