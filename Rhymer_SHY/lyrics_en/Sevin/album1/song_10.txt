You have two options
You can take the blue pill and go on thinking the way you feel
Or you can take this red pill
And I’ll show you how to peep the game really good
Yuh

[Verse 1: Sevin]
Uh
Listen closely
Silence is the code that I speak with
Same time I see violence more than frequent
When I was a child I was told it was decent
But it’s foul and it’s cold as the precinct
It ain’t hard to write
You’d be amazed at the images I’ve stored up
Scarred through life
There’s no honor in the ghetto?
Please
They’ll unite
I know you seen a crack find when they share the pipe
I got a rellie in the cell for tryin’ to scale some white
Shake my head shed my tear
Then I sail the kite
I’m no longer wondering what hell is like
Why? Cuz I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Streets breathe with lungs of cold granite
No oxygen
Just the souls of those popped and then
Left with they chest bones and they domes
Lookin’ awkward alone with no proper friend
The mere sight’ll make you nauseous
While I’m making moves too vital to be cautious
A very thin line between love and hate
But there’s no differentiation between slugs and fate
To my wife I would love to mate
But I refuse to bring a child into the sight of this loveless place
And I asked her
Judge this place
Do you really see the eyes of a father in your husband’s face?

[Hook: Sevin]
Uh
This will be where my bloodline stops
Why should I plant seed when the weeds eat crops
Momma always said there’d be bad days
But she never said I wasn’t bred with these bad ways
Father never told me life would scold me so coldly
That I’d lose most my homies
How could they know my life would be this rough
I don’t want my child to see this stuff

[Verse 2: Sevin]
How could I look right into the innocent eyes of my newborn child
With the knowledge that his smile would be soon gone
Only to be replaced with the still stare of an emotionless face
And what will I have to say
When the hood demands taxes
And he asks “daddy do I have to pay”
Will I tell him “Son fast and pray”
Instead of grab the tray watching his homeboys pass away
Will my guidance lead his soul to the cross’s light
Or will he emulate the G in me and eventually it costs his life
And would in the event I have a daughter
Will she practice the virtue that I done taught her?
What if I caught her in the arms of some nigga with charm
But doing harm to my princess’s honor
I wonder if I lose my mind
Spend the rest of her years doing time because I used a nine
If peace is a tightrope I cruise the line fighting gravity
Or fall to the safe net of agony
Full-ride scholarship to hard knock academy
Where you’ll find hollow tips and hard rock where addicts be
Death casually abducts the youth’s future
I can’t fathom bringing up confused youth bruh
Love is gone it’s a song that I’m used to
And I’d love to spawn but I’m wrong if I choose to

[Hook: Sevin]
This will be where my bloodline stops
Why should I plant seed when the weeds eat crops
Momma always said there’d be bad days
But she never said I wasn’t bred with these bad ways
Father never told me life would scold me so coldly
That I’d lose most of homies
How could they know my life would be this rough
I don’t want my child to see this stuff

[Verse 3: Sevin]
I dedicate this to the victims of abortion
The undeveloped forms of life that were tortured and torn from light
I wish I could say I sympathize
But I’m not
Cuz here wickedness is emphasized pain rarely stops
If the ones who created you were willing to consider
Murdering they child then it’s best you weren’t delivered
(That’s real)
Before you even had dreams of success
I too had dreams too many things to confess
Strive for the honor roll?
Nah that was a a long time ago
Before Sixth grade when I left behind my soul to get paid
And now a dozen lost friends and two suicide attempts later
There’s times that I covet ya’lls end
Cuz you’ll never be abused again
Or be confused when you lose a friend
Or bare accountability because you choose to sin
You get to stand before the father
Untarnished when he woos you in
As for me
I gotta make the best of my shattered dreams
Cling to my smiles though they few and far between
I’m a shattered king
Life never was fair
No wish for existence you’re better off there

[Hook: Sevin]
This will be where my bloodline stops
Why should I plant seed when the weeds eat crops
Momma always said there’d be bad days
But she never said I wasn’t bred with these bad ways
Father never told me life would scold me so coldly
That I’d lose most of my homies
How could they know my life would be this rough
I don’t want my child to see this stuff

Uh
This will be where my bloodline stops
How can I plant seed when the weeds eat crops
Momma always said there’d be bad days
But she never said I wasn’t bred with these bad ways
Father never told me life would scold me so coldly
That I’d lose most my homies
How could they know my life would be this rough
I don’t want my child to see this stuff
