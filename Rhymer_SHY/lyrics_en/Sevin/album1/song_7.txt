C'mon
Yeah
HOG MOB
For Real
You're all I live for

Sevin
You don't stand for something
You'll fall for anything mane
I live for something that's worth dying for

[Hook: Sevin]
First I pray then I ride
And it's gon' stay this way till the day that I die
Please stay by my side
You're all I live 4

I don't care what it cost
I ain't scared I will bear
I will carry my cross
'Til I'm buried and fly off
You're all I live 4

[Verse 1: Sevin]
Yeah
Yeah
I rep the Son but I still hang at night
Belly of the slum
I bang the light where they be slangin' white
I'm hanging right where they bangin' on everything in sight
Dang right you heard it
I am a converted Canaanite
I'm word servin where they herb pervin'
Off the curb surfin' like the fin on a disturbed sturgeon
My name means completion
When I teach em
"God can make you seven"
I ain't speaking in the third person
I pursuited the root of the truth and ever since
I have relished it relative it is relevant
Cuz God is omniscient in His intelligence
He's hella big like a whale"ll look to an elephant
Or more like a galaxy to a molecule
The lack of faith is the fallacy that will swallow you
So throttle
Through the pain don't let it idle you
Cuz guide you through the rain is what my God'll do

[Hook: Sevin]
First I pray then I ride
And it's gon' stay this way till the day that I die
Please stay by my side
You're all I live 4

I don't care what it cost
I ain't scared I will bear
I will carry my cross
'Til I'm buried and fly off
You're all I live 4

[Verse 2: Sevin]
Yeah for real
It's hard to be cold hearted when the love is warm
But in the womb of child neglect is where a thug is born
Can't stop the rain
Gotta learn to fly above the storm
I'mma fight for what is right until my gloves is torn
Land of broken dreams
The fiends I seen go up in smoke
All they showed us is dope
We ain't grow up with hope (nope)
How can you teach me to sing
When you ain't bust a note? (note)
How can you teach me get green
When you are just as broke?
For real
I heard they calling me a sellout
Just pray I get to heaven or get the hell out
For real
They tryin' to crucify me for my sins
But a hammer has two ends
And one of em is used for pulling the nail out
Huh
And until you choose to use yours
Where your motives lie
How can you say you love the Lord but leave your bro to die
I got enemies but I ain't got no problem wit' em
No need to send the squad to hit em
I know God'll get em
I'mma lift my master high up past the sky
And I ain't talking bugs
When I say before they see you fail
They'll see a dragon fly
That is why I'll gladly die for daddy adonai
So bring a rope for Satan's throat
Let's hang that faggot high
Heart of a warrior nothing for you but battlecry
You rule the body
Killuminati I'll stab the eye
Heart of a warrior nothing for you but battlecry
You rule the body
Killuminati let me stab the eye

[Hook: Sevin]

'Til I'm buried and fly off

[Verse 3: Pyrexx]
Jeah.. no lie I live for you
And I'mma do anything that I gotta do
And I'mma ride for you
And I'mma die for you
And I'mma take that
Bust that fire for you
And I'm a shout for you
Go do that time for you
Know things that a man with a plan
With a grain in my hand sayin' "what do I really got to do"
To show you the most incredible heart from start
But the anger with the devil really tear it apart
I'm so so far from that
No need for argument
I'm a sharpen it like an architect
So go on get off me
No time for me
I give to God
Rippin' and runnin the streets in the dark
Reppin' the Lord and doing my part
I will not ever let you get too far
I will not ever go back to before
I will not ever get back in the fog
I will not ever
I mean I would never ever
Get back in that car
No time for me I give it to God
Rippin and running the streets in the dark
Repping the Lord and doing my part
I will not ever let you get too far
I will not ever get back to before
I will not ever get back in the fog
I will not ever I mean I would never ever
Get back in that car say what......
