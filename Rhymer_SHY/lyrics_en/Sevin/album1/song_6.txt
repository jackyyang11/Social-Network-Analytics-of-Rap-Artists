What's crackin man?

Yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yeah yuh yuh yeah yuh yeah
Word
Yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yeah yuh yuh yeah yuh yeah
Ay shut up man just put the beat on homie
Yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yeah yuh yuh yeah yuh yeah
Sick of this junk
Yuh yuh yuh yuh yeah
You better act like you know

[Verse 1: Sevin]
Uh, uh
It's the rebirth beat
I've returned where the worst sleep
Trained to spit octane bangin a work beat
My gang'll be God danged
If hangin in cursed streets
Remains to be our thang
We ain't slavin' to work cheap
At first leap
I combust a rehearsed piece
Statistic like crack sales just in the first week
We turf heap
And by the name we convert sheep
Poppin' hotter than the lava the crust of the earth leaked
Used to catch me in the back streets
And runnin' from the po's like a athlete
In your sneaks
When the 4 pop off we blast heat
Trouble up out the back seat
Til rivals is wrapped up in dirt sheets
But things changed mane
Now I'm perchin' in church seats
Still 14 inches suspension my kit's sleek
Poundin down sick town strips with thick beats
Still get love from the bloods
And cuz that crypt keep
Cause the thug that once was still loves his streets
C'mon

[Hook: Sevin]
Yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yeah yuh yuh yeah yuh yeah
You better act like you know
Yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yeah yuh yuh yeah yuh yeah
You better act like you know
Yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yeah yuh yuh yeah yuh yeah
You better act like you know
Yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yeah yuh yuh yeah yuh yeah
You better act like you know

[Verse 2: Sevin]
C'mon
Uh
So what's the prognosis
I s'pose it's the mob's focus
To jog closest to the God that can guide Moses
Children of the wilderness
Killers, firocious
Survivin' off of dried raw hide and fried locust
Born in a obscure storm
But I focus
Still eatin' morsels of meat beside poachers
My adrenaline matches the venom inside cobras
Better recognize me like "Oh! Buenas Nochas"
For beef I used to keep a Sig cocked
Plus I could make Fish burn(e) like Laurence in Gridlock'd
But I quit playin' project pros like Chris Rock
Now I flip like the Boston George of hip-hop
I'm a cold blooded pastor I knelt with his flock
Now I roll on behalf of myself and his props
And my flows gon' have to be felt cuz it's hot
Til my goal's like a chastity belt and it's locked

[Hook: Sevin]
Yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yeah yuh yuh yeah yuh yeah
You better act like you know
Yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yeah yuh yuh yeah yuh yeah
You better act like you know
Yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yeah yuh yuh yeah yuh yeah
You better act like you know
Yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yeah yuh yuh yeah yuh yeah
You better act like you know

[Verse 3: Sevin]
That's right
It's full clip time
And I only used to eat huh
Once every two days to ration boy
Now I rip tracks kick back and let the cash deploy
I bring heat like a asteroid
Check ya spot
Soon as the record drops ya ave's destroyed
We used to treat em like kids
Shake em like SIDS
After layin' em in they crib with a plastic toy
Now I'm feelin' everlasting joy
Gettin' my cake right
Lakeside chillin' with the Napster boy
Who wanna face-off with Castor Troy?
I got the psycho spit
Monster truck ya'll on that Tyco tip
Go head try yo bliss
I'm the mic-phone's Michael Vick
This Sevin ain't passin boy
And my style's like high mileage on napalm gas
Disrupting your frequency like a A-Bomb blast
Endorsing the king
I'm moving with the force of a Morpheus being
Bring you the truth... in the form of a scorpion sting

Wait did I catch that
I know he didn't say that
I said I, I
Bring you the truth but in the form of a scorpion sting


What
Act like you know

Uh, uh, uh
HOG LIFE

Yeah, yeah

H to the OG
M to the OB
