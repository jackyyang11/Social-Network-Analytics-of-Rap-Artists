For real
Huh
Better check yo clock bruh
Cuz you gon' definitely need to know what time it is
Ha ha
Uh huh
I'm in love with this thing
For real
Okay
Hooked On God
In a real way
Let's go
Aye

[Verse 1: Sevin]
HL to the squadron
Forever Mobbin
Taking critical embarkments
Hit the road on a mission for the Lord
And we fishing for some souls
Politickin with my sergeants
Jehovah's the spark in the darkness
And we are the evidence He gives heart to the heartless
And we saved not soft
Anything pops off
The devil will get the cartilage from our fist
God's good ain't no lacking up in our chips
Nah
We stack it like some bar tips
International departments, huh
Yet we saturating markets
I'm in the car thick with my clique
And we whip it like a starship
Every nigga in it is repenting of his sinnin'
So we feelin' like we winnin'
And we really out here swimmin' like a Gar fish
Huh
We do things to the largest
We move strings like guitar licks
I'm Drew Brees, I'm a mark smith
I shoot 3's like a hard 6
God gave life to the lifeless
And He brought his light to the darkness
He gives might to the righteous
Let Him breathe His life into your carcass

[Hook: Sevin]
I'll be mobbin' forever
I'll die before I fail
Lord I adore You
Put this world before You
I'd rather burn in hell
I'll be mobbin' forever
I'll die before I fail
Lord I adore You
Put this world before You
I'd rather burn in hell

[Sevin Duce]
Forever mobbin' thicker than a bison
Through the night and strikin' the lightnin'
Built for war he a vikin'
Ride on the devil he'll trike in
If I doubt remember this titan
Bless those stretched for the cake and the icin'
Push the line like a spacebar
Typin'
Bible steady stay sharp as a knifin'
Still gas like a siphon
Huh
Never trippin' no shoe strings
Say I'm different no 2 Chains
Mike Jordan in the flu game
Stuck with it like a glue stain
HOG MOBBIN on a black top
Bring Christ to the trash spot
Demons getting folded like a laptop
Purple flags off in the backdrop
The Holy Spirit is the mascot
Let's Go
Keep a stick of the green for the BO
For the Lord I'mma shoot it it's a free throw
Big bro bring life then we GO
Hit my knees to pray for Tim Tebow
Praise Christ til he dry as a raisin
Whole crew fly as a raven
Collide with giants cuz we some cavemen
Then kiss the face of grace because He amazin'

[Hook: Sevin]
I'll be mobbin' forever
I'll die before I fail
Lord I adore You
Put this world before You
I'd rather burn in hell
I'll be mobbin' forever
I'll die before I fail
Lord I adore You
Put this world before You
I'd rather burn in hell

[Verse 3: Faith Pettis]
HOG MOB
It's the MOB I ain't talking about the cartel
We in the streets where they running til the car sells
No Mario we really steppin over hard shells
Bring that message to your friend though like you got mail
Pushing the word we grind it's a rock sale
Flesh dead to the world without a rot smell
Huh
I ain't witcha boy listen here
The sword that we carry ain't no souvenir
Gladiators for the Lord we don't get the cheers
They don't understand our path so we get the spear
Aiming for the side you can stick it here
He's my light and my salvation whom shall I fear
We came from the streets so He sent us there
Before we will quit we'll get the chair
He paid for our sin so we took the fare
The one that died and rose just the make it clear
We run to the streets like the bell rang for early release
Reppin' the Prince of the Peace
We not concerned with who you want us to be
As long as we slaying the beast
No denomination
If I'm claiming something
HOG MO to the B
No denomination
If I'm claiming something
HOG MO to the B

[Hook: Sevin]
I'll be mobbin' forever
I'll die before I fail
Lord I adore You
Put this world before You
I'd rather burn in hell
I'll be mobbin' forever
I'll die before I fail
Lord I adore You
Put this world before You
I'd rather burn in hell
