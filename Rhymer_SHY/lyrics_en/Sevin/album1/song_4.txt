They ain’t ready
Uh
Here we go

[Chorus 1: Sevin]
For you alone I’ll ride
Though it’s cold outside tonight
Uh, it don’t matter I’m still here, yeah
The only one who can feel me here
I will be here for life
Uh, until the day that my casket drops
You know

[Channel 1: Sevin]
Sun down
So much drama that follows me around
How can I live?
How can I live?
You know I know
There ain’t nothing on earth substituting for the feeling you give
I’mma make ‘em feel me, right here

[Verse 1: Sevin]
In it to win it so I
Get down homie
And all my representas
Will ya get down for me
I’ll bang this ’til the day that I die
Ain’t nothing changed in my love for this life
I’m spitting flame and the blood of the Christ
Came in this game I’ve got no love for this ice
Let’s get one thing clear
God is the basis of the man right here
And check this
I don’t need no diamond studded necklace
Or Lexus to flex this
The real gon respect this
It’s HOG life ’til I’m breathless mane
Ya’ll know to live is Christ but my death is gain
All that flattery don’t flatter me
He got me charged like a batter
Jehovah hold me down like gravity
Uh
He’s my protection in the storm of life
Gave his flesh so I owe him my life
Let it be known that I’m a martyr
Heard they wanna kill me here
I’ll spit harder
After death I’ll still be here

[Chorus 2: Sevin]
For you alone I’ll ride
Though it’s cold outside tonight
I’m built for the weather, down for whatever
C’mon yeah
The only one who can feel me here
I will be here for life
’Til I’m six feet deep
Keep giving up the praise
For you alone I’ll ride
Though it’s cold outside tonight
How many times I gotta tell these cats?
Uh, Yeah
The only one who can feel me here
I will be here for life
He gave His life for this you feel me?
Check it

[Channel 2: Sevin]
No doubt
You’re everything that I love and I’m sold out
Doing what you’re doing to me
Keep on keep keeping on
Keep on keep keeping on
For sure Lord
I know that you keep it real
Still loving me continuously

[Verse 2: Sevin]
Handcuffed to the hands of time
I know healin’s in your touch
So I stand in line
Concealing cuts of a man that’s dyin’
And if only I could touch your skin
I know your place all my afflictions
On a gust of wind
Trusting men was never in my Forté
Lord they treated me so poorly
Since the day my momma bore me
It gets wicked like a orgy on the pews of the church
Last days became glory
Now my crew’s in the dirt
I spit the truth and it hurts
What they harassing me for?
I guess they’d rather see me out here blasting for dough
I didn’t ask for this though
It was a blessing in disguise
They only think I’m fake cuz they can’t see these eyes
Satan relies on the flesh’s reply
It’s a predestined demise for him the second we rise
I bear the mark of Jehovah
Christ is the anti-venom for the cobra
And a million souls is my quota

[Chorus 3: Sevin]
For you alone I’ll ride
Though it’s cold outside tonight
You know, uh
The only reason I’m in this here
Check it, yuh
The only one who can feel me here
I will be here for life
Nobody feel me like He do
Uh
I dedicate my life to this right here
