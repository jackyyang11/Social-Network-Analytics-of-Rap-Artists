Hey, I got your message
That you stopped by the apartment
No worries leave your things here
For one more day

I don't know why this happened
My life is dark as hell without you;
The room feels so much colder
Since you went away

Brian, I don't want this
Why can't we sit and talk this through?
I'm losing sleep
And I need you to come back home
To me
Now

Since your brother's birthday's Friday
I sent a card from both of us
The day before there was no us
How was I to know?

Don't worry about your clothes and all
Maybe I will pack them up
Make this easier on both of us
Well, just for you

'Cause everything is breaking down, now
Since you've been gone
I don't even know the days
I don't know where to start
I'm in agony
There are times I can't breathe
Now

So, I guess that's it
I'm sorry for this message
Your bags will all be waiting, when you arrive
I hope you're doing well
Now
