[Verse]
Every December, we all gather 'round
To pay our respects to a troll so renowned
In remembrance of the friend we had
A jolly old soul we called Flemmingrad
We all dig deep down and we uproot the past
We shove up its nostrils a fist full of grass
We shape his likeness, bless his soul
Oh, Flemmy the fungus troll
