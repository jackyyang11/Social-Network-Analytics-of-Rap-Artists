[Intro]
Who you callin' a bitch?
Who you callin' a bitch? (huh?)
Who you callin' a bitch? (uh?)
Who you callin' a bitch? (yo)
(boss)

[Verse 1]
Here's a little story
And it goes like this
Watch out how you call me
I'm not yo bitch

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't believe you step to me like
I might need you ay-ya-ya
I'm a queen and when I mean it
You should see me ay-ya-ya
When you see her, you'll believe she
Only ting, she fi-ya-ya
Ay-ya-ya ya

[Chorus]
I ain't yo bitch baby, baby, baby
I ain't yo bitch baby, baby, baby
I ain't yo bitch baby, baby, baby
I ain't yo bitch baby, baby, baby
I ain't yo bitch baby

[Verse 2]
I am royal richness
I'm solid gold
Treat me like yo assets
I am your soul

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't believe you step to me like
You don't see she fi-ya-ya
When you see her, you'll believe she
Only ting, she fi-ya-ya
I'm a queen and when I mean it
You should see me ay-ya-ya
Ay-ya-ya ya

[Chorus]
I ain't yo bitch baby, baby, baby
I ain't yo bitch baby, baby, baby
I ain't yo bitch baby, baby, baby
I ain't yo bitch baby, baby, baby

[Bridge]
See I ain't out here righteous
Ooh they get me tight 'cause
I've been on that fly shit all my life
Fuck-boys always try shit
They ain't got it righted
I've been on that fly shit all my life

[Chorus]
I ain't yo bitch baby, baby, baby
I ain't yo bitch baby, baby, baby
I ain't yo bitch baby, baby, baby
I ain't yo bitch baby, baby, baby
Ain't yo bitch baby

[Outro]
We are gold, not your hoe
We are gold, not your hoe
We are gold, not your hoe
We are gold, not your hoe
We are gold, not your hoe. (bitch)
You think we done? Let's go!
