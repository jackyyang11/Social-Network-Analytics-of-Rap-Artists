[Estelle: Speaking]
So I'm in love and I keep telling this guy and it's like he thinks I'm jokin every single time I tell him it's like
"Alright, OK. I love you to yea OK" and sometimes you know when you don't know what to do and your heart is just exploding and you look at them and it's just like
So I sing it like:
Wake me up in the morning with a kiss and make me some breakfast
And in the evening a candlelight dinner
Or when I feel restless
Give me a soft massage and my neck starts to tingle
Even when we didn't have anything you still made me feel like your queen
Now crystal and their glass is clean
Sleeping on on the floor
You know what I mean
And I love you because you hold me down
When the world thinks I'm brave you see my frown
I love to be loved like this and I love and I love your kiss
So thankful
Yeah this is all I was trying to say to you:

You make me fall in love again
And I am so glad you chose me yeah
You make me fall in love again
All over and over again

[Royston:]
Your like my angel
Perfect for me, that's all I ever wanted you to be
Understand when you said that you loved me
What kind of man would I be if I told you I loved you constantly
You probably wouldn't believe me because your frontin like you don't even need me
Still I just wanted to tell, wanted to tell
You are my wife, my lover, my sister, I'm your brother
I feel you
I just wanted to tell you

[Both:]
You make me fall in love again
And I am so glad you chose me yeah
You make me fall in love again
All over and over again

[Estelle:]
Lovin you is like the song that I am singing
Like the snow and the stars and the sun and the conditions
Take it lots like the northern lights
Seeing you bounce my heart like the candle lights
I feel different didn't think this was me
I'm seeing wisdom, didn't think that this could be
I wanna kiss him got me being super girly
Head swirilng all because the love ain't hurtin
Thinking he was worth it

[Both:]
You make me fall in love again
And I am so glad you chose me yeah
You make me fall in love again
All over and over again
[Repeat to fade]
